She says it’s like trying to peer through eyeglasses that have been dipped in oil. Nancy Montz of Ohio developed a corneal ulcer, spent three weeks in the hospital and lost vision in her left eye. Carla Oliva of Florida developed a severe eye infection and, when treatment failed, had to have her right eye removed. She’s now legally blind.  The women said their problems began after they used EzriCare Artificial Tears, which is part of a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration investigation into a multistate outbreak of a rare strain of bacteria. EzriCare said in a statement last month that when it learned of the investigation January 20, it was not aware of any testing that definitively linked the outbreak to its product. “Nonetheless, we immediately took action to stop any further distribution or sale of EzriCare Artificial Tears. To the greatest extent possible, we have been contacting customers to advise them against continued use of the product.” EzriCare did not respond to CNN’s request for comment this week. The artificial tears are made by India-based Global Pharma Healthcare, which issued a recall of both EzriCare and Delsam Pharma artificial tears. Delsam Pharma’s product has not been linked to infections, but the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration have advised patients to stop using eye drops from either company pending additional guidance. Since the start of its investigation, the CDC has identified 68 people in 16 states with infections of a rare strain of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never before been reported in the United States. There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported, according to the CDC. The investigation started with three distinct outbreaks and no apparent connection, said Dr. Maroya Walters, public health service officer and the CDC’s lead investigator on the outbreak.  The agency was initially notified in late June 2022 about eye infections among four people at an ophthalmology clinic in California, and tests revealed the unexpected bacteria behind them, Walters said. The bacteria had a mutation that makes it highly resistant to drugs designed to treat it. This type of drug-resistant Pseudomonas had never been associated with an eye infection, Walters said. Walters told CNN two other infection outbreaks were reported at long-term care facilities. One involved 21 people in Connecticut in late July and another included three people in Utah in August. Genetic sequencing in September revealed that the three bacterial strains were nearly identical, Walters said. “The patients had very, very few overarching commonalities. They were from different kinds of facilities that had different kinds of infections,” Walters said. “We were really looking comprehensively at products that patients received but not finding a lot of commonalities.” As the investigators were searching for a common source, eye drop users searched for answers. Oliva, 68, says she was given EzriCare artificial tears for dry eyes from a medical center in Hialeah, Florida, in May. After using the drops for two months, she woke up August 1 with burning, itchiness, redness and tearing in her right eye.  She went to an ophthalmologist, who said she had a corneal scratch and prescribed antibiotics, but her symptoms just got worse. She then went to Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, where physicians discovered a large ulcer associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oliva says she went to Bascom Palmer every day from August 4 to September 1 to receive topical antibiotics. They also tried stronger and stronger medications, but the infection persisted. Doctors attempted to do a cornea transplant August 29, but the infection was too severe to save the eye. It was surgically removed September 1 and replaced with a plastic implant at the end of December. She spent months wondering what happened. “I cried constantly, asking why this happened to me. How could this have happened to me? I was searching for an answer: What happened to me? At what moment? How? When? What did I do?” she told CNN in Spanish. “And to not have an answer, that is the most terrible thing.” But because she didn’t know about the investigation until after she lost her eye, she continued to use the drops. Martray, 48, also had dry eyes and bought the artificial tears at a store in South Carolina last summer. After using them for about a month, she began having pain, swelling, burning, blurry vision, watering and redness.  She went to an eye doctor and got antibiotics to try to treat the infection. But she continued to use the drops until October. In December, the infection returned. She says she went to the clinic every day, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. She was eventually diagnosed with severe, permanent corneal scarring. She says her condition left her “very depressed.” “When it first came about, I just didn’t even want to leave the house. I just laid around and cried. I just wanted to get better,” she said. Similar cases were being reported across the country. According to a statement released January 20 from the CDC, from May 17 to January 19, the agency, in partnership with state and local health departments, identified the bacteria in 50 people across 11 states, with 38 cases linked to four health care facility outbreaks. Most of the people reported using artificial tears, the CDC said, and EzriCare Artificial Tears was the brand most commonly reported.  The agency’s lab testing confirmed the presence of the outbreak strain in opened eye drop bottles. Researchers are now testing unopened bottles for the same bacteria. Walters attributes the discovery in large part to sequencing and reporting done at state and local health departments. “I think without that, we never would have found this outbreak, and we need to really keep those programs strong, because I’m sure this is not the last time,” she said. “We need to maintain these activities to be able to detect future outbreaks and to be even faster at detecting them and finding the source.” Walters says the CDC continues to receive reports of “catastrophic and life-altering infections,” many of them months old. Oliva said she learned about the eye drop recall on the news early this year. At first, she felt relieved. “On the other hand, I felt anger and indignation, because how could they be so negligent, so careless to make a product that could cost someone’s life?” said Oliva, who has filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma. She says she’s had to learn how to walk again due to new issues with stability. She has trouble driving, working or doing everyday tasks like going to the grocery store.  “Everything has changed. I feel useless.” Martray, who has also filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma, said she learned about the bacteria from news articles her daughter sent her. “I’m really shocked, because I’ve always just – I just trusted,” she said. “I feel that if they’re made for the eyes and the box is sealed and everything, it’s good.  I never thought that something like that could happen. They were sealed bottle drops. You just grab them, you put them in your eyes, you don’t even think twice about it. Especially when you’ve been wearing contacts since sixth grade.” EzriCare and Global Pharma did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuits or the ongoing investigation. CNN initially reached out to EzriCare on March 17. Montz, 72, had used EzriCare tears for about a week in November when she started noticing blurry vision. One morning, she woke to find yellow discharge on her pillow. She went to the emergency room, where doctors discovered a large ulcer on her left cornea, involving nearly the entire eye. She spent three weeks in the hospital, where she got antibiotics and multiple surgeries. Her case was complicated by a serous choroidal detachment, an abnormal accumulation of fluid, which ultimately led to vision loss in the left eye.  She said she’s learning to accept her situation and feels “pretty good” despite weeks of treatment. “It is what it is. Me being crabby is not going to change anything, I have to make the best of it, accept it and go on,” she said. Martray says she’s been having frequent migraines from straining her eyes and can no longer do many things she previously enjoyed, like baking or crafts.  “You don’t realize how much you rely on your vision for, I mean, just everything. Your vision is everything,” she said. Oliva wants accountability for what happened to her and others. “I want those responsible for doing this to me and other people to pay for their negligence, because they were negligent. They marketed something that was contaminated,” she said. “They played with my life and my family’s life.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[15],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"‘Hotel Rwanda’ hero to be released from ","text":["Paul Rusesabagina, who inspired the Hollywood film “Hotel Rwanda,” was released from prison in Rwanda after his prison sentence was commuted Friday by the country’s President Paul Kagame. US senior administration officials told reporters Friday that Rusesabagina, who is a US legal permanent resident, had been transferred to the residence of the Qatari ambassador in Kigali. “He will be spending a limited period of time hosted by the Qataris,” likely a couple of days, one official said, and then will travel to Doha and on to the United States. Rusesabagina, an outspoken critic of President Paul Kagame, is best known for saving hundreds of Rwandans during the country’s genocide by sheltering them in the hotel he managed. He was arrested by Rwandan authorities while he was traveling internationally in 2020 in what his family has claimed was a kidnapping. Rusesabagina was found guilty on terrorism-related charges in September 2021 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The commutation of his sentence comes after he asked Kagame for a pardon in an October 2022 letter. “Commutation of sentence does not extinguish the underlying conviction,” said government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo on Friday. Rusesabagina, who is a dual Rwandan and Belgian citizen, was slated to be released along with 19 other people that had been convicted alongside him, Makolo told CNN. “Rwanda notes the constructive role of the US government in creating conditions for dialogue on this issue, as well as the facilitation provided by the State of Qatar,” she added. In a statement Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Rusesabagina’s release. “It is a relief to know that Paul is rejoining his family, and the US Government is grateful to the Rwandan Government for making this reunion possible. We also thank the Government of Qatar for their valuable assistance that will enable Paul’s return to the United States,” Blinken said. A spokesperson for his family said they “are pleased to hear the news about Paul’s release.” “The family is hopeful to reunite with him soon,” the spokesperson told CNN earlier Friday. At his trial in 2021, Rusesabagina was found guilty of being part of a terror group called MRCD-FLN. Two 2018 attacks in which nine people died were a particular focus, according to a government statement. However the Clooney Foundation for Justice described the verdict as a “show trial,” and claimed that Rusesabagina’s conviction lacked sufficient guarantees of fairness “required by international and African standards.” He was designated as wrongfully detained by the US government. One of the senior US officials said “there was no particular concession made by us as a government here” that led to Rusesabagina’s release. Rather, there was “a sequence of steps that were worked out involving the Rwandan government, US government and of course Paul himself,” the official said. “It took months to reach that sequence in a manner agreeable to all those involved,” they said. Multiple US officials said that Blinken’s trip to Rwanda “played a key role” in eventually resolving Rusesabagina’s case. In his engagements with Kagame he “discussed Paul’s case at length,” a US official said, and “they spoke a great deal about the road map to Paul’s eventual release.” “The State Department through SPEHA (the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs), and other members of the interagency have been working to keep it on track since the Secretary’s visit,” that US official said. The first senior official also said that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan “took a personal hand in trying to craft a way forward on this issue.” “In particular, he began quiet diplomacy with a close advisor to the President,” both by phone and in person, the official said. “Through these discussions, the parameters of a mutually acceptable arrangement emerged that the Rwandans would move towards Paul’s release and in parallel, the US government would indicate how much we welcome the developments, as we continue to do,” the official said. Both the first senior official and a congressional aide familiar with the case said that Rusesabagina’s detention had become an “irritant” in the US-Rwandan relationship, and congressional interlocutors tried to make it clear to Rwandan officials both in Washington, DC and Kigali that such an “irritant” would not go away until it was resolved. The Rwandan government wanted the US to acknowledge that there was a legal process that occurred and that process resulted in Rusesabagina being convicted, the aide said. The resolution got closer once conversations shifted away from a discussion of guilt or innocence and more toward trying to solve the issue – a strategy illustrated by a letter written by Rusesabagina to Kagame in October 2022 to request a pardon, which the congressional aide said was “carefully discussed.” In that letter – released by the Ministry of Justice Friday – Rusesabagina said he wished to express “regret for any connection (his) work with the MRCD may have had to violent actions taken by the FLN.” “As a former head of MRCD, I regret not taking more care to ensure that the MRCD coalition fully adhered to the principles of non-violence in which I fully and deeply believe, and have always ascribed,” Rusesabagina wrote. “If I am granted a pardon and released, I understand fully that I will spend the remainder of my days in the United States in quiet reflection,” he continued. “I can assure you through this letter that I hold no personal or political ambitions otherwise. I will leave questions regarding Rwandan politics behind me.” The publication of this letter expressing contrition, and the fact that Rwanda commuted his sentence, rather than pardoning him, allowed the Rwandan government to stand by their assertion of Rusesabagina’s guilt. “They continue to make clear that he’s a convicted terrorist,” the aide said. The aide also said there was immense congressional pressure on both the Rwandan government and the Biden administration on the matter, which was a complex one. Rusesabagina is a legal permanent resident of the US but not a citizen, and he did not get designated as wrongfully detained until within the last year. A second US senior administration official said that “there was some constructive participation by members and congressional staff to encourage both parties to use the existing clemency process as part of Rwandan law to help resolve the tensions between Paul and the government of Rwanda.” American lawmakers who were invested in the case on Friday welcomed the news about Rusesabagina’s commuted sentence and expected release. “Paul Rusesabagina is a hero, and his unjust detention was a stain on Rwanda’s progress toward a peaceful and stable future. Together with his family, friends, and supporters around the world, I am overjoyed to hear the news of his impending release and look forward to his safe return,” Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro said in a statement. “I commend US and Rwandan officials for working together on Mr. Rusesabagina’s release and addressing the issues surrounding his case, including those related to justice and political violence,” Republican Sen. Jim Risch said. “I look forward to seeing Mr. Rusesabagina return to his family, and encourage the U.S. and Rwandan governments to continue working to advance our bilateral relationship.” This aide downplayed Qatar’s role in securing the commutation, saying that there may have been conversations between Rwandan and Qatari officials but alleged they had “no impact” on the case.

After her disordered eating patterns spiraled into bulimia and binge eating disorder during her mid-teens, she says the ritual of abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset can exacerbate the need to restrict her eating further and risk slipping into a toxic cycle. But making the decision to refrain from the practice feels like she is neglecting a key part of her faith, she says. “I don’t trust myself with keeping a fast because I know … I’ll start to enjoy the feelings of hunger and I’m terrified (of) what that will do to me,” said the 30-year-old UK-based Muslim editor, who asked CNN to use only her first name for privacy reasons. “I do feel sad. I feel like I’m missing out on a really spiritual experience.” Habiba was nine years old when she first had the urge to make herself sick, she says. By the age of about 16 she says she was skipping meals, tracking calories, blacking out as a result of hunger, overexercising and vomiting at least 15 times a day.  “I would never wish something like bulimia, especially, on anyone, because it’s like an addiction.” Habiba is not alone in her experience. A growing number of Muslim doctors and psychologists are trying to bridge the gap between faith leaders and worshippers like Habiba, who say they face marginalization when trying to access support within their own communities, as well as in the public health system. “Minorities are underrepresented. It’s not that they don’t have eating disorders or suffer, but there is all this stigma around who comes to get help,” Dr. Omara Naseem, a UK-based counseling psychologist who specializes in treating eating disorders, said. These are “invisible and indiscriminate” illnesses that transcend age, religion, gender and sexuality, she added. “It’s an act of worship to take care of your body and health. Therefore, go and get the right help that you need,” she said. During Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to hydrate and eat a balanced meal before sunrise and then break their fast with a date and water at sunset, followed by a larger meal. Worshippers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals. However, the act of fasting during daylight hours can mask restrictive dieting patterns associated with eating disorders, said Naseem. Exercising control and experiencing hunger while fasting could generate a desire to binge large amounts of food quickly at iftar – the breaking of the fast after sundown – which could result in feeling out of control and “ashamed,” creating a “binge purge cycle” and setting back recovery, she added.  According to the Quran, people who are sick or traveling are not required to fast as long as they make up fasts once they are healthy or feed less fortunate Muslims throughout the month. Therefore, if someone has an illness or condition that is verified by a medical professional, they are not required to fast, said Imam Nadim Ali, a Muslim faith leader and licensed professional counselor based in Atlanta, Georgia. For example, children and the elderly and people who are pregnant, menstruating, or require daily medication are exempt from fasting. However, community and society-wide taboos mean that mental health illnesses are not given credence in the same way as physical sickness, both Naseem and Ali said. That means those who choose not to fast due to mental health illnesses face “guilt and shame” from their communities and wider society, added Naseem. Habiba said she has childhood memories of having her body constantly audited by members of her extended family, a behavior she says is symptomatic of the cultural pressures some South Asian and Muslim girls face as they enter womanhood. When she was 15, she remembers an uncle telling her she’d “gotten fat” after returning from a family trip to Turkey. “Comments like that stick forever,” she said. Over the following years, her weight dropped drastically. At the same time, she remembers being told by extended family members that she could no longer play outside and skateboard with her boy cousins. Instead, she was encouraged to hang out with her girl peers and play with makeup. Despite having “liberal” parents, she said, she believes her eating disorder was partly a response to the pressure of fitting into strict gender roles assigned by her community and wider society. When she was about 16, Habiba said her eating disorder symptoms worsened until her parents took her to a local doctor. She received outpatient psychiatric care at a children’s mental health unit until she was 18, when she was transferred to an adult mental health unit.  However, she says the cultural differences between herself and the White therapists she saw meant they could not understand the nuanced pressures she faced as a woman in her community; and how they were intrinsically tied to her eating disorder. “I had White therapists who just did not understand and would really just be very condescending about, you know, things that I wanted to talk about or things I was struggling with.” Farheen Hasan, a 27-year-old research psychologist based in Bristol, southwest England, agrees that there’s a need for therapists to understand specific cultural pressures. At the age of 18, Hasan said she started to exhibit disordered eating patterns in the form of avoiding food, over-exercising and becoming obsessed with healthy eating. Every year, she said she faced an internal struggle over whether or not to fast during Ramadan. “I think we need access to therapists who understand our culture, religion and struggle – and who can provide professional guidance and support,” she told CNN over email. Habiba and Hasan’s stories reflect the systemic challenges people from underserved communities widely face when accessing mental health support. Even though people of color have higher rates of some mental health disorders than White people, they face greater disparities in getting help due to institutional discrimination and interpersonal racism and stigma. Black, indigenous and people of color are significantly less likely than White people to have been asked by a doctor about eating disorder symptoms, and are half as likely to be diagnosed or to receive treatment, according to a report by the US National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.  Halima Eid, a licensed professional clinical counselor and co-founder of AMALY, a California-based non-profit organization that aims to challenge the stigma around mental health in Muslim communities, said it can be hard for people in those spaces to access the information they need. Eid established AMALY in 2020 to offer accessible therapy services, workshops, support groups and educational talks that are tailored to her local Muslim community in San Diego, California.  She also offers services online that extend to Muslims globally.  Last spring, she set up a virtual support group to help Muslims with eating disorders as they navigate Ramadan. She said that after the screening process about 30 people initially registered across two cohorts, including Muslims from the US, Australia and the UK. She intends to run the same group this year. “It is a very lonely experience to suffer from any disease or disorder on your own,” she said. “Then there’s the guilt that they’re not pleasing Allah and they’re not being good Muslims. So, we challenge perfectionism in Islam, perfectionism as Muslims during Ramadan, because a lot of people struggle.” Both Eid and Naseem, the UK-based counseling psychologist, use their Islamic and medical knowledge to serve Muslims that seek support from mental health professionals, who have a similar lived experience as women who practice Islam. “I can offer a unique perspective … it helps you use your skill set for good to groups that maybe wouldn’t engage or wouldn’t feel comfortable speaking to somebody who isn’t from their background,” said Naseem, who has created a Ramadan guide offering nutrition and faith-based advice for Muslims with eating disorders. Habiba says her bulimia reached a turning point several years ago, when she returned home from a friend’s baby shower and made herself sick after eating cakes and sweet treats. “I remember just looking at my body and being like, I don’t like this. I don’t like the way that I look and I don’t think I’m ever going to love myself, but I think I just need to accept it,” she said. “I don’t know if I can ever say that I’m fully recovered. I know that I still have that voice … in my head. But it’s quieter now.” Now, she said she is able to keep her eating disorder at bay by identifying her triggers and forcing herself to eat when she is drawn towards restrictive dieting patterns. Ramadan and Eid celebrations can trigger her eating disorder, she said, because she experienced pressure to eat large amounts of food at iftar, and received judgmental comments from family members who might not understand her decision not to fast.  Hasan, the Bristol-based research psychologist, said Muslims in their position need “social acceptance” from community leaders. “A lot of stress and mental toll would be reduced if we had acceptance and acknowledgment in the community that people struggle in different ways, and we should understand and accept them, instead of stigmatising them,” she said. Habiba said she still misses the communal aspect of breaking fasts during Ramadan, attending family dinners and counting down the days until Eid al-Fitr, the festivities that mark the end of Ramadan. “I do feel like I’m left out of the club,” Habiba said, adding that she hopes she’ll get to a point in the future where she can fast again and be sure that her faith, rather than a desire to restrict her calorie intake, is her motivation. Ali, the Atlanta-based Imam and counselor, suggested ways that Muslims with eating disorders can engage with the holy month aside from fasting, including reading the Quran, attending nightly taraweeh prayers, and donating to a feeding program. He said faith leaders and family members should acknowledge the challenges Muslims with mental health struggles face during Ramadan, and offer them guidance to help break the intergenerational cycle of shame and guilt that exists across society. “Islam is a religion that does not want people to jeopardize their lives to engage in forms of worship,” he said. “I think the important thing is for us religious leaders to be able to show empathy to the least among us, the most vulnerable among us.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[12],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"‘No legitimate basis’ for 2021 DOJ memo ","text":["Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee claim in a new report that local law enforcement pushback to a memo issued by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021 on threats to school boards around the country supports their conclusion that there was “no legitimate basis” for the directive. House Republicans also claim in the report, which provides an update to their investigation, that the memo must have been issued for political purposes – but the report does not include any direct evidence to support the allegation that any decision made by the DOJ was politically influenced. Democrats have been quick to criticize the House GOP report, saying it lacks evidence to back up its claims. The top Democrat on the House Judiciary panel, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, criticized the committee’s chair in a statement to CNN, “Jim Jordan has cherry picked a few sentences from hundreds of pages of documents to manufacture a book report on a debunked conspiracy theory. As with all of his recent work, he has produced little or no new evidence to support his claims.” The GOP report comes as Republicans have accused the Biden administration of targeting conservative speech at school boards, a claim that Democrats have pushed back on with Garland in the center of the political controversy. Republicans have also sought to elevate the issue of so-called parental rights in the classroom as a key priority for the party. Garland’s 2021 memo, which ordered federal law enforcement to meet with local authorities around the country to “facilitate the discussion of strategies for addressing threats” against education personnel, came after a spate of protests and other disruptions targeting school officials over Covid policies, school curriculum and other issues. The National School Boards Association asked the Justice Department at the time to address these issues, and wrote to President Joe Biden asking for federal help to address the violence and threats against school administrators. But the association later apologized for “some of the language” in the letter, which said the “heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism.” The memo issued by Garland specified that it was concerned with “illegal” threats and harassment  – but the memo never equated parents to domestic terrorists. Drawing on information gleaned in subpoenaed documents from the Department of Justice, FBI and the Department of Education, the committee, led by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, claims that local law enforcement officials were “generally opposed” to the memo and that there was no evidence that there was a legitimate nationwide threat to school boards –  and makes the claim that there was “no legitimate basis” for the memo. House Judiciary Committee Republicans also allege in their report, without providing direct evidence to back up the claim, that based on “the initial set of material produced in response to the subpoenas, it is apparent that the Biden Administration misused federal law-enforcement and counterterrorism resources for political purposes.” The report also claims that that there was collusion between the Biden White House, NSBA, the Justice Department and Department of Education, but frames many of the examples of communication cited in the report between the agencies as inconclusive. The NSBA and the Department of Education have denied any collusion took place. House Republicans have repeatedly called on Garland to rescind his memo, but the memo addresses meetings that happened two years ago. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. A person familiar with the Justice Department’s work, however, told CNN that “The documents show that the memo, which was issued in October 2021, directed US Attorneys to convene meetings within 30 days to learn more about threats against school officials. That has long since happened. DOJ did not hold back in turning over to Congress the feedback from different US Attorney’s offices. Some offices found the meetings helpful, a few didn’t. The memo’s purpose was to open these lines of communication and that is what DOJ did.” Garland told the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month that the memo was “aimed at violence and threats of violence against a whole host of school personnel. It was not aimed at parents making complaints to their school board. And it came in the context of a whole series of other kinds of violent threats and violence against other public officials.” Tuesday’s report highlighted three examples of local law enforcement opposing the implementation of Garland’s October 4 memo based on 448 pages provided by DOJ as the result of a subpoena. One of those examples came from then-US Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois, Steven Weinhoeft. “No one I spoke with in law enforcement seemed to think that there is a serious national threat directed at school boards, which gave the impression that our priorities are misapplied. Some expressed concerns that the federal government was meddling in an area where it does not belong,” Weinhoeft said, according to the report. Assistant US Attorney for the District of Montana Joe Thaggard acknowledged local law enforcement reported examples of criminal threats against school administrators, but advised that “local law enforcement authorities are best suited to address” them. US Attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia William Ihlenfeld II reported that the “Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police, explained his belief that most situations involving threats or harassment of school officials can be handled by state and local officials.” In addition to some pushback from local law enforcement, House Judiciary Committee Republicans claimed there was confusion over how to message Garland’s directive to the public. The report also cites four examples to claim there was “a lack of enthusiasm and participation” in the meetings mandated by DOJ as the result of Garland’s memo. The report also claims that the FBI opened 25 assessment cases related to school board threats, but only one warranted a full investigation and the remainder were referred to state and local authorities. None have led to federal prosecutions. The assessment cases, known as “Guardian Assessments,” and reported through the FBI National Threat Operations Center are akin to a tip, and typically most do not lead to investigations. Republicans have seized on the threat tags, created by the FBI, to internally track cases about school board threats to accuse the FBI and the Biden administration of trying to stomp out conservative speech at school boards. But the creation of an internal database does not mean the FBI initiated any sort of crackdown against parents. The report lists a few examples of individuals being interviewed by the FBI. Republicans claim the investigations were politically motivated, but the report does not provide direct evidence to support that claim and does not detail whether full investigations were opened or if any charges were brought in the examples given. Among them, an FBI field office interviewed a mother who told a local school board “we are coming for you” after a complaint alleged the mother was a threat because she belonged to a “right wing mom’s group” and “is a gun owner.” Another FBI field office opened an investigation into a father who opposed mask mandates after a complaint was made that the father “fit the profile of an insurrectionist” and “has a lot of guns and threatens to use them.” When asked for comment on the report, the FBI referred CNN to a statement that Director Christopher Wray made last month that “the FBI is not now, nor will it ever be in business of policing speech at school board meetings or anywhere else. Now when it comes to violence, threats of violence, we’re going to do like we always have, work with our state local law enforcement partners to deal with violence, but we are not in the business of policing speech by parents at school board meetings or anywhere else.” CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to reflect that the FBI National Threat Operations Center does not conduct interviews.

That’s not a knock on the Emmy-winning comedy as much as a tacit endorsement of wrapping things up, with the show and its trademark niceness having run its course after offering the right prescription for our Covid times. The new season picks up with the departure of Nate (Nick Mohammed) for the rival club West Ham United, lured away by the siren song of Rupert (Anthony Head), the sneering ex of AFC Richmond owner Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham). Rupert can’t help sticking the knife in at the prospect of Richmond struggling, leading to jokes about the team finishing 21st out of the league’s 20 contenders. Yet while Nate wants to please the new boss, it’s clear that his heart isn’t fully in that, suggesting his old coach’s sunny disposition might have rubbed off more than he cares to acknowledge. As for Ted (Jason Sudeikis), unlike his assistants he wants to take the high road, although he’s again plagued (somewhat tiresomely) by domestic issues regarding his far-away family, the one blight on his otherwise-positive outlook. The season’s other major subplot involves a sought-after soccer star blessed with the kind of incandescent talent that can quickly turn a team’s fortunes. Even that, though, comes with inherent risks. The unlikely arc of “Ted Lasso” – from NBC ads to fish-out-of-water TV show to two-time Emmy winner – already makes the series a success story and, perhaps more significantly, a key building block in establishing Apple TV+ as a viable streaming alternative. The show’s simple pleasures come from a variety of sources, including just listening to the way Brett Goldstein’s Roy can creatively put together a string of expletives. That said, the service has launched several standout titles in its wake, including “Severance” and more recently “Shrinking,” another comedy from members of the “Ted” creative brain trust. The reliance on “Ted Lasso” thus seems less pronounced. While the traditional pattern in television is to hang onto hits for as long as possible, streaming and premium TV producers are pushing for more finite runs, with “Succession,” “Barry” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” among other shows heading into their final seasons. (While Sudeikis has indicated this season will conclude the story, he’s also mentioned possible spinoffs, which is surely music to Apple’s ears.) “Ted Lasso” doesn’t have anything left to prove, other than perhaps demonstrating that it can finish as well as it started. However the show goes about getting there, the one certainty seems to be that its namesake will be smiling and rattling off odd analogies all the way to the final gun. “Ted Lasso” begins its third season March 15 on Apple TV+.

But the fourth episode, “The Foundling,” was actually defined by a flashback, one that featured a rather special cameo. After many questions about his origins, Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, flashed back to his perilous escape from the Jedi Temple, as a Jedi bravely rescued him from the invading troops when Order 66 was implemented. That Jedi was played by Ahmed Best, who occupies a complicated place in “Star Wars” lore as the voice of Jar Jar Binks, the comic-relief character that everyone seemed to love hating in director George Lucas’ second (and in the “Star Wars” timeline, first) film trilogy, beginning with “The Phantom Menace.” In a 2018 social-media post, Best referenced the “media backlash” that he had faced early in his career (without specifically naming “Star Wars”) and alluded to having experienced suicidal thoughts. Fans who recognized him immediately responded to the casting when the episode went live on Disney+. Other than that nostalgic callback, “The Foundling” largely dealt with Mandalore’s warrior culture, while addressing one of the logistical mysteries associated with its customs – namely, how Mandalorians eat without violating their code about removing their helmet in front of others. The Baby Grogu sequence, meanwhile, at least temporarily returned some of the focus to that character, who has occupied a less central role after his fate and future drove the narrative during the show’s first two seasons.

Ashley Lyle, who also co-created the series with Bart Nickerson, said in an interview with CNN that she “was a little surprised” when viewers started describing “Yellowjackets” Season 1 – which debuted in late 2021 and grew in popularity last year – as “a mystery box show, because we actually never approached it that way.” Still, that didn’t stop viewers from comparing it to one of the greatest television mysteries of all time, ABC’s landmark series “Lost,” a parallel she said doesn’t bother her. “It’s still in the cultural conversation,” she said. “It was a seminal show, so how you could ever be offended by being compared to a show like that is a mystery to me.” Nickerson agreed, saying the comparison is “definitely an honor,” adding that they’re “huge fans” of the series, which ran from 2004-2010. But while “Lost” and “Yellowjackets” are strikingly similar – both shows deal with the survivors of plane crashes in uncharted territories over different timelines, as well as various unexplained mysteries they must confront in the aftermath – Nickerson said they are unequivocally “different shows.” Lyle echoed that sentiment, saying they identify “Yellowjackets” as a “psychological horror show” rather than one that was “more of a science fiction show,” according to Lyle. “I think that we’re trying to do different things and thus the types of mysteries that we will be invoking are going to be very different,” Lyle said. As for those unexplained mysteries, there are more than several in “Yellowjackets,” from the strange symbol that keeps appearing on trees and elsewhere, to Taissa’s (Tawny Cypress/Jasmin Savoy Brown) sleepwalking bordering on split personality disorder, to whatever the heck is going on with Lottie (Simone Kessell/Courtney Eaton). There is also, of course, the overarching question of “what really happened out there?” – one that was uttered several times in Season 1. The team behind “Yellowjackets” assures that – perhaps unlike the polarizing wrap-up viewers experienced with “Lost” – there will be at least some closure to all the foggy doings in the “wilderness”  by the end of the series. “Not everything will have a concrete explanation, but I think that anything that can, will,” Lyle said. “There are things in life for which there will never be a concrete explanation, and I think that that’s something that we are also looking to explore.” Co-showrunner and executive producer Jonathan Lisco, who has also written two episodes of the show, said that the writing team “will have to follow our instincts” when it comes to explaining things and to what extent. “As an audience member – just to put ourselves in the shoes of the audience for a second – we don’t want to be frustrated, and overly manipulated, we want answers too,” he said. “But at the same time, the things that really live with you, the shows and movies that really live with you, do have a component of mystery,” Lisco added. “Because otherwise, it does not haunt you, it does not live in your consciousness beyond when you turn it off.” In terms of haunting, “Yellowjackets” certainly has that covered.

As for others unmoved by the slow pace of revelations in the twin-track drama, the first four episodes offer little hope of reaching a clear destination anytime soon. For the uninitiated, the series hinges on the tale of a girls high-school soccer team whose plane crashed in the wilderness. The narrative flashes back and forth between their plight and the same group (or rather, the survivors) a quarter-century later, each harboring secrets and in some instances emotional wounds regarding what transpired. The casting remains a formidable asset in both generations, with the older incarnations (played by, among others, Melanie Lynskey, Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci and Tawny Cypress) each dealing with individual challenges and traumas, including the broader question of who might be trying to blackmail them. “We did things out there that we’re really ashamed of,” Lynskey’s character, Shauna, says at one point, while grappling with a serious threat in the here and now. Shades of “Lost,” there also seems to have been something vaguely supernatural that unfolded in the woods, and the lengths to which a group stranded and potentially starving might have gone to stay alive – 30 years after “Alive,” the fact-based movie about a boys team that resorted to cannibalism under similar circumstances. Still, “Yellowjackets” (created by Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson) appears to be fairly content to luxuriate in its atmosphere while dribbling out what pass for answers, counting upon the strength of the cast and the investment that the audience has already made in the story and characters. This season also brings several new faces, including Lauren Ambrose and Simone Kessell as the adult versions of Van and Lottie, respectively, and Elijah Wood as a “citizen detective” who becomes entangled with Misty (Ricci). While those additions create other sources of mystery, they do as much to obscure the broader narrative as illuminate it. Again, that’s probably fine for the core contingent, but not so much for the skeptics wondering when the clouds might actually begin to part. “Lost,” notably, made the then-unheard-of decision to announce when it would end several years in advance in order to build toward a finish, and even then mucked it up. If “Yellowjackets” can be credited with navigating that balance in its Emmy-nominated first season, as for how long the producers can keep it going in the current day and age, let’s just say the clock’s already ticking. “Yellowjackets” begins its second season March 24 for streaming and March 26 at 9pm ET on Showtime.

The Tennessee Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Commission, which is responsible for training and enforcing standards for all local police departments in the state, on Friday approved and stamped the recommendation of decertification Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith. The three men were recommended to be decertified during an informal hearing on Thursday. On Friday, the entire commission held a procedural vote on the matter, a POST spokesman told CNN. Haley, Martin and Smith have 30 days to appeal or comply with the order. A fourth former officer, Desmond Mills Jr., who voluntarily surrendered his license cannot appeal and will no longer be allowed to work in law enforcement in the state of Tennessee effective immediately, the spokesman said. The decision comes almost two months after Martin, Smith, Haley, Mills and Tadarrius Bean were charged with second-degree murder in Nichols’ death. The five have pleaded not guilty. The four men decertified – along with others – were terminated from the Memphis Police Department in January after the death of Nichols, who was repeatedly punched and kicked by police officers following a traffic stop and brief foot chase January 7. He was hospitalized and died three days later.  Haley “was found to be in violation of personal conduct, truthfulness, neglect of duty, excessive unnecessary force, compliance with regulations to with body worn camera, and information concerning police business,” Memphis Police Department investigator Monique Williams told the commission board, while recommending Haley’s decertification. “In the matter of Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith, in addition to the same violations as Haley, Martin and Smith were also found to be in violation of duty to intervene and reporting improper conduct during an internal investigation,” Williams said. Attorneys for the three former officers had asked the commission to place their decertification in pending status. The commission agreed on the condition the attorneys appear in person at Thursday’s hearing. None of the three men nor their attorneys were present for the hearing. The commission also heard a decertification request for former officer DeWayne Smith. Smith was the senior officer on the scene the night Nichols died and is accused of not taking charge of the situation. Smith has not been charged criminally. Because former lieutenant Smith had retired prior to being terminated, there was confusion over a technicality as to whether Memphis police could decertify Smith. Decertification proceedings for Smith, Bean and Preston Hemphill “will be taken up at a future board meeting,” according to a spokesman for the commission. Hemphill was fired from the department on February 4. Memphis Police Chief CJ Davis sent a request to the commission for the decertification of the five former Memphis police officers charged in the death of Nichols in February.

The FDNY received an emergency call around 6 p.m. Tuesday regarding children trapped in the sewers, Chief of Department John Hodgens in a news conference Wednesday. Edited 911 audio released by the FDNY captures some of the exchanges between a dispatcher and a child. In one exchange, the dispatcher asked for an address. “We don’t know,” a boyish voice responded. “You don’t know?” the dispatcher said. “We’re like … we’re stuck in the sewers,” the child said. “You’re stuck where?” the dispatcher asked. “In the sewers,” the child said. Fire alarm dispatcher Marlind Haxhialiu said he asked the child questions to narrow down where the boys entered the sewer system, according to the FDNY. The responding fire units located the children’s backpacks at the entrance to the tunnel, which leads to the sewers under Clove Lakes Park. Authorities determined that the children had crawled into the sewer system through the tunnel and had traveled up to a quarter of a mile further inside, Hodgens said. FDNY Lt. John Drew said the tunnel had a 40-inch opening that later reduced to about 30 inches, making it difficult to navigate. A firefighter entered the tunnel on a rope and with breathing equipment, FDNY Deputy Chief Joe Harris said. “It was a tight space. The member had to crouch down and then crawl,” he said. The dispatcher also asked one of the boys to guide them directionally. “Once you went down, were the sewers – left, right, straight – where was it? I need you to guide me,” the dispatcher asked. “Right,” the child responded. “To the right side. How long did you walk for?” the dispatcher said. “We like … yeah, we walked a lot,” he responded. From there, the firefighters traveled along the sewer’s path to find the kids. “We walked along the route that we knew the sewer traveled and opened up manhole covers searching for the children,” Hodgens said. Firefighters found the children by opening one of the manhole covers above them, and the dispatcher urged the kids to raise their voices and call for help. Moments after this, the FDNY said, responding units located and rescued the children. The boys were brought to safety about 30 minutes after emergency personnel responded. They spent about an hour inside the sewer system before being rescued, Hodgens said. Firefighter John Loennecker said the boys were “relieved” to be rescued and out of the cold, wet and dark tunnel. “They were crawling on their knees for about an hour,” he said. “It was dark down there. They had one cell phone light, and that was it.” All five kids were transported to Richmond Medical Center for evaluation. One firefighter sustained minor injuries during the rescue. “I’m glad everyone was able to work together to rescue these five children,” Haxhialiu said.

The crash happened around 12:40 p.m. Wednesday at a work zone between temporary concrete walls on Interstate 695 in Woodlawn, about 8 miles northwest of Baltimore, Maryland State Police said in a news release. A driver in an Acura was attempting to change lanes when the vehicle “struck the front corner panel on the passenger side” of another vehicle, an updated news release from state police said. “Crash Team investigators believe this caused the Acura to lose control and subsequently travel into the work zone,” the release said.

The disease is well advanced by the time memory and behavior are affected. “Alzheimer’s disease begins in the brain decades before the first symptoms of memory loss,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer’s preventive neurologist who is also at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases. If doctors are able to identify the disease in its earliest stages, people could then make healthy lifestyle choices and control their “modifiable risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes,” Isaacson said, Just how early can we see signs of cognitive decline? To find out, a recent study examined donated tissue from the retina and brains of 86 people with different degrees of mental decline. “Our study is the first to provide in-depth analyses of the protein profiles and the molecular, cellular, and structural effects of Alzheimer’s disease in the human retina and how they correspond with changes in the brain and cognitive function,” said senior author Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a statement. “These changes in the retina correlated with changes in parts of the brain called the entorhinal and temporal cortices, a hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time,” Koronyo-Hamaoui said. Investigators in the study collected retinal and brain tissue samples over 14 years from 86 human donors with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment —  the largest group of retinal samples ever studied, according to the authors. Researchers then compared samples from donors with normal cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment and those with later-stage Alzheimer’s disease. The study, published in February in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, found significant increases in beta-amyloid, a key marker of Alzheimer’s disease, in people with both Alzheimer’s and early cognitive decline. Microglial cells declined by 80% in those with cognitive issues, the study found. These cells are responsible for repairing and maintaining other cells, including clearing beta-amyloid from the brain and retina. “Markers of inflammation were (also) found, which may be an equally important marker for disease progression,” said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. “The findings were also apparent in people with no or minimal cognitive symptoms, which suggests these new eye tests may be well-positioned to aid in early diagnosis.” The study researchers found higher numbers of immune cells tightly surrounding amyloid beta plaques as well as other cells responsible for inflammation and cell and tissue death. Tissue atrophy and inflammation in cells in the far periphery of the retina were most predictive of cognitive status, the study found. “These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease earlier and more accurately,” Isaacson said, “and monitor its progression noninvasively by looking through the eye.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[5,4],"topic_weights":[91,9],"title":"Autism diagnosis has become more common,","text":["The rate of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has been growing steadily since 2000, but two new reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight disparities in the types of children identified to have autism spectrum disorder and setbacks in early detection. In 2020, about 1 in 36 children had been diagnosed with autism by age 8, according to the CDC – about 2.8%. That’s up from a prevalence of 1 in 44 children in 2018 and 1 in 150 children in 2000. But according to the CDC, this long-term trend has “largely been interpreted as improvements in more equitable identification of (autism spectrum disorder), particularly for children in groups that have less access or face greater barriers in obtaining services.”  For the first time, diagnosis was more common among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it was among White children. The CDC researchers note that this shift “may reflect improved screening, awareness, and access to services among historically underserved groups.” In fact, between 2018 and 2020, autism prevalence rose more than twice as fast among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it did among White children. These findings are based on surveillance data from 11 communities that participate in the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. The data are not nationally representative and vary widely by location – from a prevalence of 1 in 22 children in California to about half as many in Maryland. The CDC says more research is needed to understand this variation, which could be related to differences in the strategies used to identify and diagnose the condition. Still, some trends have stayed consistent. Autism prevalence is significantly higher among boys than girls – in 2020, there was about a four-fold difference. But it was the first year that more than 1% of 8-year-old girls had been diagnosed with autism. Also, disparities persist in identifying autism in children who also have an intellectual disability. In 2020, more than half of Black children diagnosed with autism also had an intellectual disability, compared with less than a third of White children. According to the researchers, this finding suggests a need to better detect and evaluate developmental concerns beyond cognitive ability. Generally, children who have intellectual disabilities are more likely to be diagnosed with autism earlier. But early detection is important for all children with autism, as it helps connect them with helpful resources and interventions. In recent years, good progress had been made in early detection of autism – an earlier CDC report found that children born in 2014 were 50% more likely to receive an autism diagnosis or special education by age 4 than those born in 2010.  Another new report published by the CDC on Thursday shows that there was evidence of continued improvement in these trends through February 2020, but the trends reversed as the Covid-19 pandemic hit with “sustained lower levels” of evaluations and identification of autism across most of the surveillance network. In first six months of the pandemic, there were 217 fewer evaluations for every 1,000 children at age 4 than there were four years earlier. There were also nearly three fewer identifications for every 10,000 children, according to the CDC report. “Disruptions due to the pandemic in the timely evaluation of children and delays in connecting children to the services and support they need could have long-lasting effects,” said Dr. Karen Remley, director of CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. “The data in this report can help communities better understand how the pandemic impacted early identification of autism in young children and anticipate future needs as these children get older.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[15,0,13,6,2],"topic_weights":[44,18,16,13,9],"title":"BBC cancels ‘Top Gear’ filming after Fre","text":["The BBC has halted production on the latest series of motoring show “Top Gear” following an investigation into an accident that left co-host Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff injured. Flintoff, who has fronted the popular show alongside Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness since 2019, was hospitalized last December when he was hurt while filming an episode at the Dunsfold Aerodrome track in Surrey, southern England. On Thursday, the corporation released a statement saying it had “sincerely apologized” to the former England cricket captain following its probe and “will continue to support him with his recovery.”  “Under the circumstances, we feel it would be inappropriate to resume making series 34,” the BBC said. “We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but it is the right thing to do, and we’ll make a judgement about how best to continue later this year.” The broadcaster added that the incident had “impacted the production team” and there will be a health and safety review on the show, which has been running for 21 years. CNN has contacted Flintoff’s representatives for comment.  In February 2019, Flintoff crashed into a market stall while filming the show in Nottinghamshire but escaped unscathed. “I go to great lengths to make sure I do well in ‘Top Gear’ drag races but on this occasion I went a few lengths too far,” the father-of-four said at the time. “It will look more ridiculous than dangerous when you see it on TV”. The former cricket star is not the only “Top Gear” host to have been involved in a high-speed crash while filming the show. In 2006, Richard Hammond was left in a coma for two weeks after crashing in a Vampire jet car traveling at 288 miles per hour. He suffered serious head injuries but survived and returned to the series. Hammond now hosts Amazon’s “The Grand Tour” alongside his one-time “Top Gear” colleagues Jeremy Clarkson and James May.

But it seemed the president’s actions, and warnings from US officials, had not deterred the attacks, as shortly before he spoke, another American service member was injured in a separate strike in Syria. “Make no mistake: the United States does not – does not – seek conflict with Iran. But be prepared for us to forcefully protect our people,” Biden had said during remarks in Canada on Friday afternoon, where he is on a two-day visit. “That’s exactly what happened last night,” he went on. “We’re going to continue to keep up our efforts to counter terrorist threats in the region.” The president’s remarks marked his first public comments since the US carried out a strike Thursday evening on Iranian facilities that the Pentagon said were used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The response – which the Pentagon said was “proportionate and deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize casualties” – came after a suspected Iranian drone struck a facility housing US personnel in the country, killing an American contractor and wounding five US service members. On Friday, another US service member was injured but in stable condition following a rocket attack near oil and gas fields known as Conoco in the vicinity of Deir Ezzor in Syria, a US official confirmed to CNN. “On the evening of March 24th, two attacks targeted U.S. and coalition forces in Syria. At 10:39 p.m. Syrian local time, multiple rockets targeted coalition forces at Mission Support Site Conoco,” the official said. The official said a second attack occurred “at approximately 11:23 p.m. Syrian local time when three one-way attack unmanned aerial vehicles targeted Green Village. Two of the three unmanned aerial vehicles were struck down by coalition air defense systems.” The attack on Green Village – a US base in northeast Syria – did not result in injuries but did leave one building damaged, the source said. Biden said Friday that his “heart and deepest condolences” went out to the family of the contractor killed and the president wished a “speedy recovery” for those wounded. An official familiar with the matter told CNN that the other service members injured in the Thursday strike were in stable condition. Earlier Friday, 10 rockets had targeted Green Village, where some of the 900 US troops in Syria are based. There were no injuries to US or coalition personnel, and no damage to facilities, the Pentagon said in a statement. One rocket, however, missed the coalition facilities by five kilometers and hit a civilian home, injuring two women and two children, a CENTCOM statement said. The strikes are likely to increase tensions with Iran, with which the proxy groups are aligned, though Tehran isn’t always involved in directing attacks that they conduct. The US has already sanctioned Tehran for providing attack drones to Russia to use in the war in Ukraine. And on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley reiterated US concerns that Iran has the potential to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon in less than two weeks and manufacture one within months. Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, emphasized to reporters Friday that the US is not seeking conflict with Iran. “We don’t see escalation with Iran,” he said. “But the strikes that we took last night were intended to send a very clear message that we will take the protection of our personnel seriously and that we will respond quickly and decisively if they’re threatened.” The drone used in the Thursday attack intentionally crashed into its target, the official said. The infrastructure that was targeted in the US response was not directly related to the suspected Iranian drone itself, the official said, but was instead targeted by the US because it was known to be supporting Iranian proxy groups in the country with munitions and intelligence. The number of casualties from the US airstrike is still being determined, the official said. A UK-based group monitoring the war in Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that eight Iranian-affiliated fighters were killed in the airstrikes. CNN could not verify that claim. CNN has reached out to the Iranian and Syrian government foreign ministries for comment. The Syrian and Iranian governments have not publicly commented, but Iran’s state-run Press TV cited a military source in Syria saying “the resistance groups reserve right to respond to the American attack and will take reciprocal action.” Iran is an important ally to Syrian President Bashar Al Assad. Along with Hezbollah and other Iran-backed armed groups, Tehran has helped to prop up the embattled president. The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Erik Kurilla, said the US could carry out additional strikes if there were more attacks. “We are postured for scalable options in the face of any additional Iranian attacks,” Kurilla said in a statement Thursday evening. Kurilla said earlier Thursday that Iranian proxies had carried out drone attacks or rocket attacks against US forces in the Middle East 78 times since the beginning of 2021, an average of nearly one attack every 10 days. “What Iran does to hide its hand is they use Iranian proxies,” Kurilla told a House Armed Services Committee hearing earlier in the day. “That’s either UAVs or rockets to be able to attack our forces in either Iraq or Syria.” Asked if such attacks were considered an act of war, Kurilla said, “They are being done by the Iranian proxies is what I would tell you.” The Biden administration has carried out airstrikes against militias affiliated with Iran on multiple occasions following previous attacks on US facilities in the region. In February 2021, Biden’s first known military action was to carry out strikes against Iranian-backed militias after rocket attacks on US troops in Iraq. And in August, the US struck a group of bunkers used for ammunition storage and logistics support by Iranian proxies in Syria, after rockets landed near another US facility. Milley visited US troops in Syria earlier this month, marking the first time he has visited as the top US general. Milley visited troops in northeast Syria who are there as part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS, a mission the US carries out with its partners in the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. But Milley’s visit also focused on the safety of US troops, his spokesman had said, and he inspected for protection measures in Syria. Two weeks before Milley’s visit, US and coalition forces at Green Village in Syria came under rocket attack. No US or coalition troops were injured in that attack, but it underscored the threat emanating from adversaries in the region, often in the form of Iranian-backed proxies or militias. Just two days before the rocket attack, four US troops and one working dog were injured in a helicopter raid against a senior ISIS leader in northeast Syria.

The “Invest in America” tour will see Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and nearly a dozen Cabinet members hit more than 20 states – including key battleground states like Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania – over the next three weeks. The tour is the White House’s most coordinated, concerted push to date to accomplish what White House officials see as their central task this year: implementing legislation and making sure Americans know what Biden has accomplished. Polling published last month indicated the White House has its work cut out: 62% of Americans said they believe Biden has accomplished “not very much” or “little or nothing,” according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll. Biden will make his first of multiple stops on Tuesday with a visit to a semiconductor manufacturer in Durham, North Carolina, which has announced plans to build a $5 billion chips manufacturing facility that will create 1,800 new jobs, spurred on by passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, which incentivizes domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Other Cabinet secretaries and top White House officials will highlight the effects of other pieces of legislation in the tour’s first week: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will highlight airport safety and infrastructure projects in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will visit fiber optic cable manufacturers in North Carolina; and Biden’s infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu will highlight electric vehicle manufacturing in Tennessee, among others. Harris, who is traveling to Africa next week, will make stops when she returns to highlight the growth of domestic manufacturing, the official said. The first lady, a community college teacher, is expected to highlight workforce training programs. “From shovels hitting the ground on new infrastructure projects made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to new electric vehicle manufacturing facilities as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, to communities benefitting from high-speed internet because of the American Rescue Plan, to new semiconductor fabs thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, the tour will highlight how the President’s Investing in America agenda is growing the economy from the middle-out and bottom-up, not top down,” the White House said in a statement. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Small Business Administration Administrator Isabel Guzman are expected to travel as part of the three-week tour. The tour coincides with a two-week congressional recess in April and will also include stops with members of Congress. Biden will head to North Carolina a day after convening a meeting of his “Invest in America” Cabinet, which is comprised of key Cabinet officials working to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan. Biden and his Cabinet will highlight the direct and indirect impacts of those laws – including private sector investments spurred on by pieces of legislation – and the impact on state and local economies at each stop.

Blinken said the current wait time for a regular passport is “about ten to thirteen weeks, and for an expedited passport about seven to nine weeks.” The State Department is “getting 500,000 applications a week for passports,” which is 30 to 40% more applicants this year than last year, Blinken told a House Appropriations subcommittee budget hearing. “Historically, the demand’s been cyclical, the busy season is kind of March to late summer. Basically it’s full time now,” he said. “We’ve hired staff to increase the adjudicative capacity to make sure that … we’ve got the customer service, phone lines manned, we have more people in the pipeline and that’s also reflected in the budget. It’s hugely important,” he said. The top US diplomat said he has “a task force established at headquarters to marshal all of these efforts so that we’re really digging in on this.” “We were authorizing overtime, we’ve opened satellite offices, we’re organizing cores at the headquarters to assist in processing, processing times,” Blinken said. He noted that the department had launched a pilot online renewal platform so Americans who already have a passport can renew online, but it has “now halted it to make sure that we can fine tune it and improve it before we roll it out in a bigger way.” “We expect that 65% of renewal customers for passports will be able to do so online once this program is fully up and running,” Blinken said. “I think it’s really important that we be as clear and transparent as possible with people who are looking for passports to know what they can expect,” he said. On visas, Blinken said delays have begun to improve. The priority is the categories “for students, for temporary workers, for business travelers, maritime crews,” he said, noting, “we’ve tried to make sure that they are served and we are at pre-pandemic levels or better in those categories.” “For visitor visas, the median global interview appointment wait time is two months, half of what it was a year ago,” he said, but added that the wait times are lower “in most places.” “The immigrant visas are a whole other issue.

The Sun-Times also reports, according to sources, that the decision was made by the front office and not the players. In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill that expands a ban on so-called LGBTQ “propaganda” in Russia, making it illegal for anyone to promote same-sex relationships or suggest that non-heterosexual orientations are “normal.” CNN has reached out to the NHL for comment. “The Chicago Blackhawks organization is proud to continue its annual Pride Night celebration, an evening – alongside year-round efforts – fueled by partnership and LGBTQIA+ community engagement,” the team told CNN in a statement on Thursday.  “Together, our activities will focus on fostering conversation and more equitable spaces in our pursuit to make hockey more inclusive. We do not condone anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric, and we stand firmly with the community. “While we know game-day celebrations like these are an important way we can use our platform to bring visibility, it is the work we do together 365 days a year that can create true impact in ensuring all of our colleagues, fans and communities feel welcomed and safe within our sport.” On the Blackhawks’ website, advertising for the Pride night promotion for the team’s Sunday game against the Vancouver Canucks, says: “Pride Night brings the entire Blackhawks organization together to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community and stand together for inclusion.

On Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Chew appeared before US lawmakers, many of whom want the app banned in the United States because of the risk they say it presents to national security. The clamor for a sale seems to have grown even louder after the grilling Chew received in Washington. But an outright divestment isn’t in the cards, according to analysts and legal experts, not least because the Chinese government views TikTok’s technology as sensitive and has taken steps since 2020 to ensure it can veto any sale by its Beijing-based owner, ByteDance. At issue is who owns the keys to TikTok’s algorithms and the vast troves of data collected from the 150 million people in the United States who use the app each month. China responded to the Biden administration’s demand for the first time on Thursday, saying it would “firmly” oppose a forced sale of TikTok. A sale or divestiture of TikTok would involve the export of technology, so it would need obtain a license and approval from the Chinese government, according to a commerce ministry spokeswoman. The Chinese government considers some advanced technology, including content recommendation algorithms, to be critical to its national interest. In December, Chinese officials proposed tightening the rules that govern the sale of that technology to foreign buyers. “Beijing will have no say in the US decision to mandate the sale of TikTok, but it will retain the ultimate approval authority over such a sale,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Kaiyuan Capital. “It also seems extremely unlikely that Beijing will accept any deal that removes TikTok’s algorithm[s] from its direct control and regulatory authority,” he said. TikTok’s algorithms, which keep users glued to the app, are believed to be key to its success. The algorithms give recommendations based on users’ behavior, thus pushing videos they actually like and want to watch. Chinese regulators first added algorithms to the restricted list of technologies in August 2020, when the Trump administration threatened to ban TikTok unless it was sold. Back then, Chinese state media published a commentary by a professor of trade at the University of International Business and Economics who said the updated rules meant ByteDance would need a license from Beijing to sell its technology. “Some cutting-edge technologies might impact national security and public welfare, and need to be included in [export control] management,” Cui Fan told Xinhua. The intended sale of TikTok in 2020 to Oracle and Walmart hit a snag after Beijing added algorithms to its export control list. The Biden administration eventually rescinded the Trump-era executive order targeting TikTok, but replaced it with a broader directive focused on investigating technology linked to foreign adversaries, including China.  Now, the company is once again caught up in a geopolitical struggle between Washington and Beijing. “The TikTok hearings in the United States mark the beginnings of a regulatory meat-grinder facing all [Chinese] tech companies,” said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. A senior official from the Chinese regulator of digital and traditional media visited Bytedance’s offices last week. He urged the company to improve the use of “recommendation algorithms” to spread “positive energy” and strengthen the review of online content, according to a statement from the regulator posted on its website. The visit highlights Beijing’s resolve to keep its most powerful internet companies on a tight leash. It also has more direct levers to pull. In April 2021, a Chinese government entity acquired a “golden share” of 1% in a Beijing subsidiary of ByteDance, according to business data platform Qichacha. The subsidiary controls operating licenses for Douyin, TikTok’s sister app in China, and Toutiao, a news aggregation app. “TikTok’s algorithms make it truly unique in terms of data harvesting and strategic analytics, therefore, I don’t see Beijing allowing it to fall into the hands of US interests,” said Capri. “Unless they can somehow still access TikTok’s data through other means and methods, including ongoing cyber intrusion and other forms of back-door access.” Chinese regulators have been gradually tightening their control over algorithm technology more generally. Starting in March 2022, an unprecedented regulation came into effect requiring internet companies to register recommendation algorithms with the Cyberspace Administration, the powerful internet regulator that reports to President Xi Jinping. At the beginning of 2023, rules governing “deep synthesis algorithms” also took effect. They will restrict the use of AI-powered image, audio and text-generation software. Such technologies underpin popular apps such as ChatGPT. These regulatory developments suggest that TikTok’s recommendation algorithms will be subject to China’s export controls, said Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law. TikTok has been erecting technical and organizational barriers that it says will keep user data safe from unauthorized access. Under the plans, known as Project Texas, the US government and third-party companies such as Oracle would also have some degree of oversight of TikTok’s data practices. TikTok is working on a similar plan for the European Union known as Project Clover.  But that hasn’t reassured US officials, likely because no matter what TikTok does internally, China would still theoretically have leverage over TikTok’s Chinese owners. (Similar measures taken by Huawei didn’t prevent it from being kicked out of Western 5G markets.) And the concerns would remain even if TikTok is sold to an American buyer, Capri said. “A change of TikTok’s ownership solves nothing,” he said. “The real issue is general data security and who ultimately has access to that data, by whatever means, regardless of legal ownership.” The true test, he said, is whether user data can be effectively ring-fenced and privacy and security can be achieved through data segregation, encryption and other means. As for a solution, Silvers expects both sides to try to “finesse a compromise” where US concerns are addressed, but Beijing still retains control over TikTok. But, he believes Beijing would ultimately prefer for TikTok leave the US market rather than surrender its algorithm. “If any Chinese company is to have any chance of surviving increased scrutiny from Western governments, they will have to entrust their data to third party security firms and endure rigorous third party audits and government intrusion, in addition to transferring ownership,” Capri said. “This is really an existential crisis for Chinese firms operating in the West.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[11,9,2],"topic_weights":[88,7,5],"title":"China says it ‘firmly opposes’ a potenti","text":["China said it would “firmly oppose” any forced sale of TikTok, in its first direct response to demands by the Biden administration that the app’s Chinese owners sell their share of the company or face a ban in its most important market. The comments came as TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified in front of US lawmakers amid mounting scrutiny over the app’s ties to Beijing. China’s commerce ministry said Thursday that a forced sale of TikTok would “seriously damage” global investors’ confidence in the United States. “If the news [about a forced sale] is true, China will firmly oppose it,” Shu Jueting, a spokeswoman for the ministry, told a Thursday news conference in Beijing, adding that any potential deal would need approval from the Chinese government. “The sale or divestiture of TikTok involves technology export, and administrative licensing procedures must be performed in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations,” she said. “The Chinese government will make a decision in accordance with the law.” Previously, Beijing didn’t weigh in directly on a potential forced sale. However, starting in 2020, it had signaled it wanted to protect Chinese technology by adding recommendation algorithms, which could include TikTok’s, to a list of technologies restricted for export.  On Thursday, Chew, in his first congressional hearing, sought to provide nuanced answers and tried to assuage lawmakers’ worries about the company and its parent, Beijing-based Bytedance. But he was frequently interrupted and called evasive by lawmakers. After more than five hours of testimony, the lawmakers expressed deep skepticism about his company’s attempts to protect US user data and ease concerns about its ties to China. That means there will likely be more calls by Washington to ban TikTok if the company does not spin itself off from its Chinese parent, analysts said.

The move comes as ties between the world’s two biggest economies are at their worst in decades following months of rising diplomatic tension, including the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over North America. It also follows unusually direct comments by Chinese leader Xi Jinping targeting the United States, accusing Washington of trying to “contain” and “suppress” China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was asked about the employees’ detention at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Friday, but said she was not aware of the situation.

A couple of years ago, she noticed that her stomach often felt irritable, and she would get sudden urges to use the restroom, sometimes with blood in her stool. She even went to the hospital one day when her symptoms were severe, she said, and she was told it might be a stomach ulcer before being sent home.  “That was around the time when Chadwick Boseman, the actor, passed away. I remember watching him on the news and having the same symptoms,” Lawson said of the “Black Panther” star who died of colon cancer at age 43 in August 2020. “But at that time, I was not thinking ‘this is something that I’m going through,’ ” she said. Instead, Lawson thought changing her diet would help. She stopped eating certain red meats and ate more fruits and vegetables. She began losing a lot of weight, which she thought was the result of her new diet. “But then I went for a physical,” Lawson said. Her primary care physician recommended that she see a gastroenterologist immediately because she had low iron levels. “When I went and I saw my gastro, she said, ‘I’m sorry, I have bad news. We see something. We sent it off to get testing. It looks like it is cancer.’ My whole world just kind of blanked out,” Lawson said. “I was 35, healthy, going about my day, raising my daughter, and to get a diagnosis like this, I was just so shocked.” Lawson, who was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer, is among a growing group of colon and rectal cancer patients in the United States who are diagnosed at a young age. The share of colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults younger than 55 in the US has been rising since the 1990s, and no one knows why. Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are calling for more work to be done to understand, prevent and treat colorectal cancer at younger ages.  In a paper published last week in the journal Science, the researchers, Dr. Marios Giannakis and Dr. Kimmie Ng, outlined a way for scientists to accelerate their investigations into the puzzling rise of colorectal cancer among younger ages, calling for more specialized research centers to focus on younger patients with the disease and for diverse populations to be included in studies on early-onset colorectal cancer. Their hope is that this work will help improve outcomes for young colorectal cancer patients like Lawson. Among younger adults, ages 20 to 49, colorectal cancer is estimated to become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030.  Lawson, now 36 and living in Palm Bay, Florida, with her 5-year-old daughter, is in remission and cancer-free. The former middle school teacher had several surgeries and received radiation therapy and chemotherapy to treat her cancer. She is now being monitored closely by her doctors.  For other young people with colorectal cancer, “my words of hope would be to just stay strong. Just find that courage within yourself to say, ‘You know what, I’m going to fight this.’ And I just looked within myself,” Lawson said. “I also have a very supportive family system, so they were definitely there for me. But it was very emotional,” she said of her cancer treatments. “I remember crying through chemotherapy sessions and the medicine making you so weak, and my daughter was 4, and having to be strong for her,” she said. “My advice to any young person: If you see symptoms or you see something’s not right and you’re losing a lot of weight and not really trying to, go to see a doctor.” Signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer include changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, cramping or abdominal pain, weakness and fatigue, and weight loss.  A report released this month by the American Cancer Society shows that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019. Yet the factors driving that rise remain a mystery. There’s probably more than just one cause, said Lawson’s surgeon, Dr. Steven Lee-Kong, chief of colorectal surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. He has noticed an increase in colorectal cancer patients in their 40s and 30s within his own practice. His youngest patient was 21 when she was diagnosed with rectal cancer. “There is a phenomenon of decreasing overall colorectal cancer rates in the population in general, we think because of the increase in screening for particularly for older adults,” Lee-Kong said. “But that doesn’t really account for the overall increase in the number of patients younger than, say, 50 and 45 that are developing cancer.” Some of the factors known to raise anyone’s risk of colorectal cancer are having a family history of the disease, having a certain genetic mutation, drinking too much alcohol, smoking cigarettes or being obese. “They were established as risk factors in older cohorts of patients, but they do seem to be also associated with early-onset disease, and those are things like excess body weight, lack of physical activity, high consumption of processed meat and red meat, very high alcohol consumption,” said Rebecca Siegel, a cancer epidemiologist and senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author of this month’s report.  “But the data don’t support these specific factors as solely driving the trend,” she said. “So if you have excess body weight, you are at a higher risk of colorectal cancer in your 40s than someone who is average weight. That is true. But the excess risk is pretty small. So again, that is probably not what’s driving this increase, and it’s another reason to think that there’s something else going on.” Many people who are being diagnosed at a younger age were not obese, including some high-profile cases, such as Broadway actor Quentin Oliver Lee, who died last year at 34 after being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. “Anecdotally, in conferences that I’ve attended, that is the word on the street: that most of these patients are very healthy. They’re not obese; they’re very active,” Siegel said, which adds to the mystery. “We know that excess weight increases your risk, and we know that we’ve had a big increase in body weight in this country,” she said. “And that is contributing to more cancer for a lot of cancers and also for colorectal cancer. But does it explain this trend that we’re seeing, this steep increase? No, it doesn’t.” Yet scientists remain divided when it comes to just how much of a role those known risk factors – especially obesity – play in the rise of colorectal cancer among adults younger than 55. Even though the cause of the rise of colorectal cancer in younger adults is “still not very well understood,” Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty argues that dietary and lifestyle factors could be playing larger roles than some would think. “We know that smoking, alcohol, lack of physical activity, being overweight or obese, increased consumption of red meat – so basically, dietary factors and environmental and lifestyle factors – are likely playing a big role,” said Chakraborty, a gastroenterologist with The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. “There are also some other factors, such as the growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease, that may also be playing a role, and I think the biggest factors is most likely the diet, the lifestyle and the environmental factors,” he said. It has been difficult to pinpoint causes of the rise of cases in younger ages because, if someone has a polyp in their colon for example, it can take 10 to 15 years to develop into cancer, he says.  “During that, all the way from a polyp to the cancer stage, the person is exposed to a variety of things in their life. And to really pinpoint what is going on, we would need to follow specific individuals over time to really understand their dietary patterns, medications and weight changes,” Chakraborty said. “So that makes it really hard, because of the time that cancer actually takes to develop.” Some researchers have been investigating ways in which the rise in colorectal cancer among younger adults may be connected to increases in childhood obesity in the US. “The rise in young-onset colorectal cancer correlates with a doubling of the prevalence of childhood obesity over the last 30 years, now affecting 20% of those under age 20,” Dr. William Karnes, a gastroenterologist and director of high-risk colorectal cancer services at the UCI Health Digestive Health Institute in California, said in an email. “However, other factors may exist,” he said, adding that he has noticed “an increasing frequency of being shocked” by discoveries of colorectal cancer in his younger patients. There could be correlations between obesity in younger adults, the foods they eat and the increase in colorectal cancers for the young adult population, said Dr. Shane Dormady, a medical oncologist from El Camino Health in California who treats colorectal cancer patients.  “I think younger people are on average consuming less healthy food – fast food, processed snacks, processed sugars – and I think that those foods also contain higher concentrations of carcinogens and mutagens, in addition to the fact that they are very fattening,” Dormady said. “It’s well-publicized that child, adolescent, young adult obesity is rampant, if not epidemic, in our country,” he said. “And whenever a person is at an unhealthy weight, especially at a young age, which is when the cells are most susceptible to DNA damage, it really starts the ball rolling in the wrong direction.” Yet at the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, researchers and physicians are not seeing a definite correlation between the rise in colorectal cancer among their younger adult patients and a rise in obesity, according to Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, gastroenterologist and co-director of the center, where scientists and doctors continue to work around the clock to solve this mystery. “When we looked at our patients, the majority were more likely to be overweight and obese, but when we compare them to a national cohort without cancer, they’re actually less likely to be overweight and obese,” she said. “And anecdotally, a lot of the patients that we see are young and fit and don’t really fit the obesity profile.” That leaves many oncologists scratching their heads. Some scientists are also exploring whether genetic mutations that can raise someone’s risk for colorectal cancer have played a role in the rise of cases among younger adults – but the majority of these patients do not have them. Karnes, of UCI Health, said “it is unlikely” that there has been an increase in the genetic mutations that raise the risk of colorectal cancer, “although, as expected, the percentage of colorectal cancers caused by such mutations, e.g., Lynch syndrome, is more common in people with young-onset colorectal cancer.” Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer, causing about 4,200 cases in the US per year. People with Lynch syndrome are more likely to get cancers at a younger age, before 50. “In my practice and in the medical community, the oncologic community, I don’t think there’s any proof that genetic syndromes and gene mutations that patients are born with are becoming more frequent,” El Camino Health’s Dormady said. “I don’t think the inherent frequency of those mutations is going up.”  The tumors of younger colorectal cancer patients are very similar to those of older ones, said Mendelsohn at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “So then, the question is, if they’re biologically the same, why are we seeing this increasingly in younger people?” she said. “About 20% may have a genetic mutation, so the majority of patients do not have a family history or genetic predisposition.” Therefore, Mendelsohn added, “it’s likely some kind of exposure, whether it be diet, medication, changing microbiome,” that is driving the rise in colorectal cancers in younger adults. That rise “has been something that’s been on our radar, and it has been increasing since the 1990s,” Mendelsohn said. “And even though it is increasing, the numbers are still small. So it’s still a small population.” Dormady, at El Camino Health, said he now sees more colorectal cancer patients in their early to mid-50s than he did 20 years ago, and he wonders whether it might be a result of colorectal cancer screening being easier to access and better at detecting cancers. “The first thing to consider is that some of our diagnostic modalities are becoming better,” he said, especially because there are now many at-home colorectal cancer testing kits. Also, in 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended age to start screening for colon and rectal cancers from 50 to 45. “I think you have a subset of patients who are being screened earlier with colonoscopies; you have advancing technology where we can potentially detect tumor cell DNA in the stool sample, which is leading to earlier diagnosis. And sometimes that effect will skew statistics and make it look like the incidence is really on the rise, but deeper analysis shows you that part of that is due to earlier detection and more screening,” he said. “So that could be one facet of the equation.” Overall, pinpointing what could be driving this surge in colorectal cancer diagnoses among younger ages will not only help scientists better understand cancer as a disease, it will help doctors develop personalized risk assessments for their younger patients, Ohio State University’s Chakraborty said.  “Because most of the people who go on to develop colorectal cancer really have no family history – no known family history of colon cancer – so they would really not be aware of their risk until they begin to develop symptoms,” he said. “Having a personalized risk assessment tool that will take into account their lifestyle, their environmental factors, genetic factors – I think if we have that, then it would allow us hopefully, in the future, to provide some personalized recommendations on when a person should be screened for colorectal cancer and what should be the modality of screening based on their risk,” he said. “Younger adults tend to develop colon cancer mostly in the left side, whereas, as we get older, colon cancer tends to develop more on the right side. So there’s a little difference in how we could screen younger adults versus older adults.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[4,3],"topic_weights":[73,27],"title":"Denver public schools close for mental h","text":["Denver Public Schools are closed after a shooting this week at a high school as the district takes steps to bring armed guards back to campuses and teachers, students and parents demand action to curb gun violence. Friday’s mental health break, ahead of a weeklong spring break, is meant “to allow us all to take a moment to pause and process the challenging events this year,” including the shooting at East High School and a district data breach announced earlier this year, district superintendent Alex Marrero said in a statement. An East High student also was fatally shot this year, CNN affiliate KMGH reported, and the school last month got false threats of violence. Scores of teachers and students rallied for a second-straight day Friday at the state capitol to urge lawmakers to support gun violence prevention bills, KMGH reported. “I can’t even walk outside my house without feeling like I’m gonna die, or I’m gonna get shot,” Aubriana Acuna told the station on Thursday. “We have to be here because we don’t want this to happen again,” East High student Beckett Nelson Gardner told KMGH. “You don’t want to have to take time out of our school just to not be scared and horrified of what just happened to us.” “We just want to know: Are our kids safe to come back?” parent Steve Katsaros told KMGH on Friday. “Our teachers aren’t gonna come back unless they know they’re safe, and I don’t blame them. I will support them. I will picket with them.” “Teachers are real big part of this because they’re doing the work of the police department now,” he added. “These are teachers; they aren’t police officers. So, there’s a lot of things that need to change.” The latest shooting – in which two staff members were wounded – unfolded Wednesday morning at East High as 17-year-old Austin Lyle was undergoing a required pat down search, Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas said. Lyle had been under a school safety plan that mandated he be searched upon entering the building, he said. It was at least the 18th US school shooting this year at K-12 schools, colleges and universities, according to a CNN tally. Lyle fled after the shooting and later fatally shot himself, police said. His body and car were found in the mountains about 50 miles southeast of Denver after a manhunt. The district’s Board of Education on Thursday suspended at least temporarily its ban on placing armed school resource officers or other armed security in schools. That ban was “a mistake,” Denver Mayor MIchael Hancock said. It was adopted almost two years ago in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in police custody in MInneapolis. Schools there voted to push police officers out of schools, and districts followed suit across the country, including in Denver. The East High shooting victims are Eric Sinclair, the school’s dean of culture, and Jerald Mason, a restorative practice coordinator in the dean’s office, a district spokesperson confirmed to CNN. On Wednesday, one was in critical condition while the other was in stable condition with serious injuries, Thomas said.  The district’s Board of Education unanimous vote Thursday to suspend its ban on armed school resource officers or other armed security on campuses will remain in effect until June 30, according to the board’s motion, which directed the superintendent to ensure that school staff are not using armed officers to respond to disciplinary issues. Marrero, the superintendent, said Wednesday that he was “committed” to having two armed police officers stationed at East High School during school hours through the end of the academic year, regardless of the official policy. “I am willing to accept the consequences of my actions,” Marrero said in a letter to the board. The superintendent said he doesn’t believe the ban on armed officers contributed to the shooting, saying such an officer “would have never patted down that student.” Denver Mayor Michael Hancock praised the board’s decision in a tweet Thursday. The board said the district lacks money to pay for additional armed security indefinitely. It directed Marrero to talk to Hancock  to gain money for at east two armed police officers “and as many as two additional mental health professionals” in Denver high schools for the rest of the year.  Lyle, who was identified by police as the shooter, underwent mandatory daily pat downs upon entering the school as part of a special school safety plan. The police chief declined to explain why. Lyle fled after firing several shots in an office area away from other students and staff, police said.  A multi-agency search followed, ending when the Jefferson County SWAT team found Lyle’s body around 8:15 p.m., not far from his car, Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw said Thursday. Authorities learned that Lyle liked to shoot and camp in the mountains near the town of Bailey, Colorado, McGraw told affiliate KUSA. Lyle’s car was found on the side a road there, and search crews, including K9 units, found his body about 300 yards from it. Marrero said he has contacted Lyle’s parents. “We all as educators came into this profession to support [and] help students thrive, and most importantly, provide them an opportunity to succeed,” Marrero said. “I can acknowledge we failed Austin as a district.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[4,3],"topic_weights":[74,26],"title":"Denver Public Schools to temporarily sus","text":["One day after two faculty members were shot and wounded by a student at a Denver high school, the local school board voted unanimously to temporarily suspend its nearly two-year-old ban on armed guards and police officers in its schools. “Based on the emergency situation presented by the events of March 22, 2023, the Board of Education will hereby suspend (the ban on armed officers) through June 30, 2023,” stated the motion approved by the board Thursday. School district Superintendent Alex Marrero said Wednesday that he was “committed” to having two armed police officers stationed at East High School during school hours through the end of the academic year regardless of the official policy. “I am willing to accept the consequences of my actions,” Marrero said in a letter to the board. He was present at Thursday’s board vote, but did not speak at the meeting. “Today was my fourth visit to Denver Health’s Intensive Care Unit due to victims of gun violence,” Marrero said in a letter to the Board of Education. “These events should not have happened on my watch or this Board’s Watch.” The alleged gunman, 17-year-old Austin Lyle, fled East High School Wednesday after the shooting, police said, and his body was found Wednesday night in Park County. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the coroner’s office said Thursday. The victims of Wednesday’s shooting are Eric Sinclair and Jerald Mason, Denver Public Schools spokesperson Rachel Childress confirmed to CNN. Sinclair is the school’s dean of culture and Mason is a restorative practice coordinator in the dean’s office, according to the school’s website. One staff member was in critical condition, while the other suffered serious injuries and was stable, Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas said Wednesday. Lyle’s body was found around 8:15 p.m., after an hourslong, multi-agency manhunt, near a red Volvo SUV sought by law enforcement, Park County Sheriff Tom McGraw said during a news conference, telling apprehensive nearby residents an earlier shelter-in-place alert had been lifted. Lyle was identified as the suspect in the shooting by Denver police officials, who said he was under a school safety plan requiring him to undergo daily pat down searches upon entering the school. During Wednesday’s search, a handgun was retrieved and several shots were fired in an office area in the front of the school, Thomas said, away from other students and staff. The police chief declined to say why the suspect was on that plan. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock indicated he wants school resource officers back in all schools. “Removing them was a mistake,” he said in a statement on Twitter, “and we must move swiftly to correct it.” The board on Thursday emphasized that the superintendent needed to develop a new safety plan, but also that the district does not have enough money for additional armed security indefinitely. The board directed Marrero to reach out to Hancock in an effort to “externally fund as many as two armed police officers and as many as two additional mental health professionals” in every Denver high school for the remainder of the school year. The district’s policy banning armed security at schools was adopted as part of a larger plan undertaken by the board of education in the summer of 2020, which said it wanted to “transition” school resource officers from Denver campuses, citing studies that showed “Black and Brown students arrested for minor school infractions are more likely to end up in the adult criminal system, entrenching the school-to-prison pipelines.” That came amid a broader movement in some communities to push police out of schools after the police murder of George Floyd. Proponents of those efforts said the presence of officers in schools criminalized Black and Latino students. East High will close for the remainder of the week following the shooting, Marrero said during a news conference Wednesday. Sheriff McGraw described the manhunt as “quite intense,” adding agencies involved included the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Ultimately, the Jefferson County SWAT team led the search and located a body about 1,000 feet from the suspect’s vehicle, roughly four hours after the SUV was first located around 4:30 p.m., said McGraw. The sheriff declined to say how the death happened and declined to disclose whether there was a gun found near the body. As of Wednesday, police did not say whether the gun used in the shooting had been recovered.  The shooting at East High School was the 18th shooting this year at an elementary or secondary school in the US in which at least one person was injured or killed, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit whose mission is to log every incident of gun violence nationwide in real time. The shooting at East High is yet another example of how violence shatters one of the most conventional – yet dangerously prone – places for children. And for students at the school, the chaos was all too familiar. Last month, 16-year-old student Luis Garcia was shot inside a parked car near the school and died weeks later, according to CNN affiliate KMGH. A group of East High students later attended a city council meeting and demanded action on gun violence and school safety, KMGH reported. Aubriana Acuna said she was “freaking out” when she learned of the shooting and said it’s unfair that she has to endure the constant occurrences of gun violence. “We’re just kind of numb to it at this point since this has happened so much,” she told KMGH. “We’re so exhausted about all this. It’s so unfair. … This happens almost every single day. I can’t even walk outside my house without feeling like I’m gonna die, or I’m gonna get shot. And it’s terrifying for everyone.”  Students have come out in scores recently to demand a change in how gun violence is being handled in their community. The Denver East High School chapter of Students Demand Action staged a school walkout and called for immediate action on gun safety earlier this month. The demonstration was marked by a march through the city to the State Capitol building and featured more than 1,000 students and educators, according to the organization. Students at the event wore red and held signs such as “School was my safe place,” “Our blood, your hands” and “Am I next?,” according to KMGH. East High, located in the City Park neighborhood, serves about 2,500 students in 9th through 12th grades. The school is the largest and highest-performing comprehensive high school of all Denver Public Schools, according to the school system.

Europe’s Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index, which tracks 42 big EU and UK banks, closed 3.8% lower. The index is down 18% from its high in late February. London’s bank-heavy FTSE 100 index closed down 1.3%. Shares in Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank\n            \n                (DB), plunged as much as 14.5% before paring its losses to close 8.5% lower. Shares in UBS\n            \n                (UBS) and Credit Suisse\n            \n                (CS) were 3.6% and 5.2% down respectively. The cost of insuring against a possible default by Deutsche Bank on its debt has soared in recent days. Deutsche’s five-year credit default swaps (CDS) skyrocketed to 203 basis points Thursday, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence. That’s their highest level since early 2019. The swaps rose again Friday to trade at 208 basis points at midday ET. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Friday that there was “no reason to be concerned” about Deutsche Bank. “It’s a very profitable bank,” he told reporters in Brussels, where EU leaders issued a joint statement describing the European banking system as “resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions.” Deutsche Bank declined to comment. “The rising price of insuring CDS senior debt is weighing on Deutsche Bank, as well as other European banks, on concerns over the impact of rising rates on the wider economy and banks’ balance sheets,” Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, told CNN. Last week, the European Central Bank stuck with its plan to hike interest rates by half a percentage point, judging that inflation posed a bigger threat to the economy than recent turmoil in the banking sector. Then, on Thursday, the Bank of England raised its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point after data showed a surprise spike in inflation last month. But Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at investing platform Hargreaves Lansdown, told CNN that market nerves were out of step with reality. “Worries about contagion are again rearing up even though more deposits appear to have been flowing into the German lender since the banking scare erupted, and it is thought to have capital reserves well in excess of regulatory requirements,” she said. Some analysts said investors had been rattled by Deutsche Bank’s announcement Friday that it would pay back one of its bonds five years before its maturity date. Investors would usually interpret such a move as a sign that a company is in good financial health and able to pay back its creditors early. But — after two bank collapses in the United States and an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse this month — some investors may have interpreted the announcement as a sign that Deutsche Bank is nervous about the state of the banking sector and trying to overcompensate, Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, told CNN. Goltermann said the bank’s decision “seems to have backfired.” Deutsche Bank’s decision to pay back the bond ahead of schedule was pre-planned and not a reaction to recent market developments, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The bond would have gradually lost its eligibility as a form of regulatory capital according to rules brought in after the 2008 financial crisis, the source said. The bank replaced the bond by issuing another bond of the same type in February, they added. Shares of Germany’s Commerzbank\n            \n                (CRZBF) and France’s Société Générale also suffered heavy losses, closing 5.5% and 5.9% lower respectively. Last week, Switzerland’s biggest bank UBS bought its embattled Swiss rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) in an emergency takeover brokered by the Swiss government. That helped restore some calm to markets rattled by the failure earlier this month of two US regional banks. But investors were on edge again Friday. The falls in UBS and Credit Suisse come after Bloomberg reported Thursday that the US Department of Justice was investigating whether their staff had helped Russian oligarchs evade Western sanctions. The DOJ had sent subpoenas to those employees before UBS took over Credit Suisse, according to the report. Employees at some major US banks are also part of the probe, Bloomberg said. Hewson at CMC Markets said “the DOJ probe into UBS is certainly playing a part in the share price weakness” in European banks. UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment to CNN.

A flash flood can happen anywhere intense rain falls faster than the soil can absorb. And as the name says, it happens in a flash! Geography and topography play important roles in how soil handles extreme rainfall. Water rises very quickly – with wide variation possible even over small regions – so pinpointing exactly where flash flooding will occur is a major challenge. Flash floods often happen when storms have been “training,” or rolling over the same areas for hours. This can overwhelm creeks, rivers and even storm drains and send water rushing into streets and neighborhoods. Excessive rainfall outlooks are issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center to give an idea of where flash flooding could happen on a given day based on rain forecasts. The agency’s National Weather Service issues more localized flash flood watches and warnings where the biggest flooding threat is expected. If you find yourself in a flash flood, move to higher ground immediately. Get out of floodwaters as quickly as you can, as they could be contaminated or electrically charged – or harboring fire ants or alligators. Never drive on flooded roads. It only takes 2 feet of rushing water to carry away most vehicles, including pickups and SUVs, the weather service says. Floodwaters also can hide a variety of dangers, including whether the road has collapsed or washed away. If a flood strands you in your car, “abandon it immediately and seek higher ground,” NOAA suggests. Mountainous areas are extremely susceptible to flash flooding. There’s not as much surface area for rain to soak into soil before steep inclines send it rushing down, where it can overwhelm streams and rivers and funnel into valleys and rise quickly with little warning. Landscape scarred by wildfire, especially around mountains, can result in a greater risk of flash flooding in heavy rain. “In some areas, where the fire burned hot enough or long enough, soils develop a layer that actually repels water, like rain on pavement,” NOAA says. “Rainfall that would normally be absorbed by the forest canopy and loose tree litter and duff on the ground will instead quickly run off.” Often, charred soils from burned areas can quickly come loose and get carried downhill by rainwater, causing debris flows that race into valleys. “Debris flows are fast-moving, deadly landslides,” NOAA says. “They are powerful mixtures of mud, rocks, boulders, entire trees – and sometimes, homes or vehicles.” Catastrophic flash flooding can also happen when water overtops a levee or dam, or a levee or dam gets damaged or compromised. When a levee breaches or a dam fails, enormous amounts of water can spill out with very little warning. This kind of sudden release of water can drown entire towns. A prime example of this was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when numerous levee breaches across New Orleans unleashed historic flooding, sending people to their rooftops for safety and killing hundreds.

The parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have argued the charges have no legal justification and that they should not be held responsible for their son’s killings. In a written opinion filed Thursday, a panel of judges for the state’s appellate court acknowledged the possible precedent-setting nature of this case – holding parents accountable for a child’s crimes – but called the situation unique and unusual. “We share defendants’ concern about the potential for this decision to be applied in the future to parents whose situation viz-a-viz their child’s intentional conduct is not as closely tied together, and/or the warning signs and evidence were not as substantial as they are here,” wrote the panel. The opinion said that those concerns are “significantly diminished” by the fact that Crumbley’s actions “were reasonably foreseeable, and that is the ultimate test that must be applied.” In the opinion, the judges cited text messages from the months before the massacre in which Crumbley told his parents about experiencing paranoia and hallucinations, including his belief that a demon was throwing objects around the house. When his mother didn’t reply, he sent her another message asking, “can you at least text back.” His mother did not text back that day and was riding horses with James at the time, according to the opinion. Crumbley also told a friend that he believed he was having a mental breakdown and asked his parents for medical help but that his father told him to “suck it up” and his mother laughed, according to the opinion. In a concurring opinion, Judge Michael Riordan noted that the case was exceptional because of how clear it was that Crumbley was struggling with his mental health and contemplating violence – and the fact that his parents provided him a handgun anyway. “Our legal system does not, nor should it, criminally punish people for subpar, odd, or eccentric parenting, or require that children be deprived of any instrumentality that otherwise is legal to possess and use. Moreover, I suspect that parents do not reasonably assume, as a matter of course, that their children will commit violent crimes,” wrote Riordan wrote. “However, before us is the unusual case. EC was extraordinarily troubled, yet defendants nonetheless provided him with a handgun and, despite having discrete, disturbing evidence that EC contemplated harming others, did nothing when confronted with that evidence.” Jennifer and James Crumbley can appeal the decision to Michigan’s Supreme Court, which previously ruled that there appears to be enough evidence to move forward with a trial.   Ethan Crumbley, 15 years old at the time, shot and killed four students and injured six students and a teacher at his Michigan high school in November 2021. He pleaded guilty in October to terrorism and murder charges. A hearing is set for May 1 where a circuit court judge will consider whether Crumbley, a minor prosecuted as an adult, can be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Crumbley’s parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were also arrested days after the shooting following a manhunt that led authorities to a Detroit warehouse. Accused of providing their son easy access to a firearm and disregarding warning signs, the pair were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors have argued the Crumbleys “willfully ignored the needs and well-being of their son and the threat he posed to others.” In a December 2021 court filing, they said that the parents knew their son was depressed and “fascinated” with guns. On the day of the shooting, school officials held a meeting with James and Jennifer Crumbley after discovering disturbing drawings their son made featuring guns and the words, “The thoughts won’t stop help me.” The school advised the parents to provide counseling to their son within 48 hours. But the parents declined to take their son out of school and he returned to the classroom. According to Ethan Crumbley’s statements in court, he retrieved a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack, and pulled it out of his bag in a bathroom before opening fire on his classmates. James Crumbley purchased the gun used by his son just four days before the massacre, according to prosecutors. Attorneys for Crumbley’s parents previously indicated that they would want their son to testify in their defense should their case go to trial.

In February, the European Parliament approved the law. All that was needed was a rubber stamp from the bloc’s political leaders. Then Germany changed its mind. In a reversal that stunned many EU insiders, the German government decided to push for a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars beyond the 2035 deadline — as long as they run on synthetic fuels. It’s an exception that could put the European Union’s green credentials at risk. The bloc is legally obliged to become carbon-neutral by 2050. With cars and vans responsible for around 15% of its total greenhouse gas emissions, a phase-out of polluting vehicles is a key part of EU climate policy. Here’s what’s at stake. The ban on internal combustion engine cars is one of the centerpieces of the European Union’s ambitious plan to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050 — which means removing from the air at least as much planet-heating pollution as the bloc emits. The law envisions a total ban on the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2035. The European Union argues that the deadline is necessary because the average car’s lifespan is around 15 years — so to get a fleet that produces no carbon pollution by 2050, sales of combustion engine cars must end by 2035. Germany is now pushing against the idea that all internal combustion engines must be banned. Instead, it says engines powered by “green” fuels should be allowed. Other European countries, including Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic, have joined Germany in demanding the exception. The law was meant to be formally approved by the European Council — the European Union’s top political body — earlier this month, but the vote was postponed because of the growing opposition. Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, are made using hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere. Their proponents often portray them as “clean”, but the reality is not straightforward. Burning these man-made fuels releases similar amounts of planet-heating emissions and air pollutants as using conventional fossil fuels. The “green” credentials refer to the manufacturing process: e-fuels are made from carbon that was removed from the atmosphere, which offsets the emissions they produce. For climate campaigners and the lawmakers who negotiated the new rules, this is not good enough. “The text is very clear,” Dutch EU lawmaker Jan Huitema told CNN. “We only allow cars on the market as long as there are zero emissions from driving them. E-fuels emit carbon dioxide from the tailpipe. They will not be allowed.” There are other problems too. For one, e-fuels are not yet produced at scale. The manufacturing process is expensive and requires a lot of renewable energy. Supply of e-fuels is likely to be limited for some time, and critics say they should be reserved for industries that do not have a viable alternative to fossil fuels, such as aviation and shipping. Many EU policy makers were flabbergasted by the demands from Germany and others. The legislation had been in the works for more than two years and had required many rounds of negotiations. “I was the lead negotiator with the [European] Council on the final text, it was adopted there by the ambassadors of the different member states,” Huitema said. “You have an agreement and now, all of a sudden, a couple of member states want to refrain from the agreement. That is not how you negotiate and how you make deals with each other.” Climate groups say the changes would water down action on climate change. Transport & Environment, a clean transport campaign group, said the loophole for e-fuels would slow down the transition to electric vehicles. “[Germany’s] plan would derail the decarbonization of the new fleet while allowing more conventional oil to be used in the existing fleet post-2035 — a win-win for Big Oil.” Even some carmakers have come out against the potential changes to the law. A group of dozens of companies including Volvo and Ford have penned an open letter to the European Union, pushing against the exception. “First-mover companies have already significantly invested in zero-emission vehicles and should be rewarded for taking the inherent risks to decarbonize their fleet. It would be a very negative signal to reverse the political agreement reached last year,” they said. Germany is governed by a coalition, and it is one of the parties, the liberal FDP, that is calling for the changes. “The internal combustion engine is not the problem. The fossil fuels that run it are,” German transport minister Volker Wissing, of the FDP, said on Twitter earlier this month. “The goal is climate neutrality, which is also an opportunity for new technologies. We need to be open to different solutions,” he added. Germany is home to some of the world’s largest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Volkswagen, and the government has to walk a tightrope between ambitious climate policies and the interests of a powerful industry that keeps the economy humming. Manufacturers of car components and engines, fossil fuel producers and fuel transportation companies have been lobbying for the exception because it would allow them to continue using their existing infrastructure and products. The Federation of German Industries, a lobby group, said e-fuels could make “a major contribution to achieving the adopted climate targets.” “Since they can be used immediately without having to build a new infrastructure, they can also be implemented in economically less developed countries,” according to a statement on the group’s website. The dispute over the legislation is causing friction within Germany’s government. Environment Minister Steffi Lemke of the Greens, another coalition party, has criticized the challenge to the law. “Germany should remain a reliable partner to its EU partners. The new CO2 fleet regulation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which Germany has supported in recent months, is a major step forward for European climate protection,” she said in a statement earlier in March. If passed, the law would be one of the world’s strongest measures to phase out gasoline vehicles. Scientists say reducing planet-heating pollution is non-negotiable if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels and avoid a key tipping point beyond which extreme flooding, droughts and wildfires will likely become much more frequent. Despite such warnings and the pledges made in the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, global emissions have continued to rise, barring a dip in 2020. Talks are continuing to persuade Germany to support the law. In its current draft form, the law would allow cars running on e-fuels to be sold after 2035, but only if they were fitted with technology preventing them from running on gasoline or diesel. Whether Germany will accept the proposal remains unclear. Some are concerned that the dispute casts doubt on the European Union’s ability to implement its ambitious climate agenda. “This debate is really destabilizing,” said Elisa Giannelli, a senior policy advisor at E3G, a climate think-tank, noting that the European Union had been “on track for climate neutrality.” “Backtracking on a piece of legislation is potentially really undermining the credibility of what we’ve achieved over the past years,” she said. “It’s not just about cars. It’s about the political signals that that [dispute] sends.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[11],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"Everyone in Washington is talking about ","text":["After TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified for more than five hours on Thursday before a Congressional committee, one thing was clear: US lawmakers remain convinced that TikTok is an urgent threat to national security. The hearing, Chew’s first appearance before Congress, kicked off with a lawmaker calling for TikTok to be banned and remained combative throughout. A number of lawmakers expressed deep skepticism about TikTok’s efforts to safeguard US user data and ease concerns about its ties to China. Nothing Chew said appeared to move the needle. The rhetoric inside and outside the hearing room highlighted the growing, bipartisan momentum for cracking down on the app in the United States. As the hearing was taking place, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he supports legislation that would effectively ban TikTok; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said TikTok should be “ended one way or another,” and the Treasury Department issued a statement vowing to “safeguard national security,” without mentioning TikTok by name. Concerns about TikTok’s connections to China have led governments worldwide to ban the app on official devices, and those fears have factored into the increasingly tense US-China relationship. But the remarks across the federal government on Thursday, combined with a prior threat from the Biden administration to impose a nationwide ban unless TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their stakes, shows that a complete ban of the hugely popular app very much remains a live possibility. However, more than two years after the Trump administration first issued a similar threat to TikTok, evidence remains unclear about whether the app is a national security threat. Security experts say the government’s fears, while serious, currently appear to reflect only the potential for TikTok to be used for foreign intelligence, not that it has been. There is still no public evidence the Chinese government has actually spied on people through TikTok. TikTok doesn’t operate in China. But since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, the theory goes that ByteDance, and thus indirectly, TikTok, could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of TikTok data. “It’s not that we know TikTok has done something, it’s that distrust of China and awareness of Chinese espionage has increased,” said James Lewis, an information security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The context for TikTok is much worse as trust in China vanishes.” When Rob Joyce, the National Security Agency’s director of cybersecurity, was asked by reporters in December to articulate his security concerns about TikTok, he offered a general warning rather than a specific allegation. “People are always looking for the smoking gun in these technologies,” Joyce said. “I characterize it much more as a loaded gun.” Technical experts also draw a distinction between the TikTok app — which appears to operate very similarly to American social media in the amount of user tracking and data collection it performs — and TikTok’s approach to governance and ownership. It’s the latter that’s been the biggest source of concern, not the former. The US government has said it’s worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users. The laws in question are extraordinarily broad, according to western legal experts, requiring “any organization or citizen” in China to “support, assist and cooperate with state intelligence work,” without defining what “intelligence work” means. Should Beijing gain access to TikTok’s user data, one concern is that the information could be used to identify intelligence opportunities — for example, by helping China uncover the vices, predilections or pressure points of a potential spy recruit or blackmail target, or by building a holistic profile of foreign visitors to the country by cross-referencing that data against other databases it holds. Even if many of TikTok’s users are young teens with seemingly nothing to hide, it’s possible some of those Americans may grow up to be government or industry officials whose social media history could prove useful to a foreign adversary. Another concern is that if China has a view into TikTok’s algorithm or business operations, it could try to exert pressure on the company to shape what users see on the platform — either by removing content through censorship or by pushing preferred content and propaganda to users. This could have enormous repercussions for US elections, policymaking and other democratic discourse. Security experts say these scenarios are a possibility based on what’s publicly known about China’s laws and TikTok’s ownership structure, but stress that they are hypothetical at best. To date, there is no public evidence that Beijing has actually harvested TikTok’s commercial data for intelligence or other purposes. Chew, the TikTok CEO, has publicly said that the Chinese government has never asked TikTok for its data, and that the company would refuse any such request. In Thursday’s hearing, Chew said that what US officials fear is a hypothetical scenario that has not been proven. “I think a lot of risks that are pointed out are hypothetical and theoretical risks,” Chew said. “I have not seen any evidence. I am eagerly awaiting discussions where we can talk about evidence and then we can address the concerns that are being raised.” If there’s a risk, it’s primarily concentrated in the relationship between TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, and Beijing. The main issue is that the public has few ways of verifying whether or how that relationship, if it exists, might have been exploited. TikTok has been erecting technical and organizational barriers that it says will keep US user data safe from unauthorized access. Under the plan, known as Project Texas, the US government and third-party companies such as Oracle would also have some degree of oversight of TikTok’s data practices. TikTok is working on a similar plan for the European Union known as Project Clover. But that hasn’t assuaged the doubts of US officials. Multiple lawmakers at the hearing specifically said they were not persuaded by Project Texas. That’s likely because no matter what TikTok does internally, China would still theoretically have leverage over TikTok’s Chinese owners. Exactly what that implies is ambiguous, and because it is ambiguous, it is unsettling. In congressional testimony, TikTok has sought to assure US lawmakers it is free from Chinese government influence, but it has not spoken to the degree that ByteDance may be susceptible. TikTok has also acknowledged that some China-based employees have accessed US user data, though it’s unclear for what purpose, and it has disclosed to European users that China-based employees may access their data as part of doing their jobs. Multiple privacy and security researchers who’ve examined TikTok’s app say there aren’t any glaring flaws suggesting the app itself is currently spying on people or leaking their information. In 2020, The Washington Post worked with a privacy researcher to look under the hood at TikTok, concluding that the app does not appear to collect any more data than your typical mainstream social network. The following year, Pellaeon Lin, a Taiwan-based researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, performed another technical analysis that reached similar conclusions. But even if TikTok collects about the same amount of information as Facebook or Twitter, that’s still quite a lot of data, including information about the videos you watch, comments you write, private messages you send, and — if you agree to grant this level of access — your exact geolocation and contact lists. TikTok’s privacy policy also says the company collects your email address, phone number, age, search and browsing history, information about what’s in the photos and videos you upload, and if you consent, the contents of your device’s clipboard so that you can copy and paste information into the app. TikTok’s source code closely resembles that of its China-based analogue, Douyin, said Lin in an interview. That implies both apps are developed on the same code base and customized for their respective markets, he said. Theoretically, TikTok could have “privacy-violating hidden features” that can be turned on and off with a tweak to its server code and that the public might not know about, but the limitations of trying to reverse-engineer an app made it impossible for Lin to find out whether those configurations or features exist. If TikTok used unencrypted communications protocols, or if it tried to access contact lists or precise geolocation data without permission, or if it moved to circumvent system-level privacy safeguards built into iOS or Android, then that would be evidence of a problem, Lin said. But he found none of those things. “We did not find any overt vulnerabilities regarding their communication protocols, nor did we find any overt security problems within the app,” Lin said. “Regarding privacy, we also did not see the TikTok app exhibiting any behaviors similar to malware.” TikTok has cited Lin’s research as part of its defense. But Citizen Lab came out swinging this week at the company’s characterizations of the paper, saying in a statement that TikTok has presented the research as “somehow exculpatory” when a key finding was that Lin couldn’t see what happens to user data after it is collected. Chew, in a rare moment of apparent frustration, told lawmakers at the hearing that TikTok and Citizen Lab were really saying a version of the same thing. “Citizen Lab is saying they cannot prove a negative, which is what I’ve been trying to do for the last four hours,” he said. TikTok has faced claims that its in-app browser tracks its users’ keyboard entries, and that this type of conduct, known as keylogging, could be a security risk. The privacy researcher who performed the analysis last year, Felix Krause, said that keylogging is not an inherently malicious activity, but it theoretically means TikTok could collect passwords, credit card information or other sensitive data that users may submit to websites when they visit them through TikTok’s in-app browser. There is no public evidence TikTok has actually done that, however. TikTok has said the keylogging function is used for “debugging, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring,” as well as to detect bots and spam. Other research has shown that the use of keyloggers is extremely widespread in the technology industry. That does not necessarily excuse TikTok or its peers for using a keylogger in the first place, but neither is it proof positive that TikTok’s product, by itself, is any more of a national security threat than other websites. There have also been a number of studies that report TikTok is tracking users around the internet even when they are not using the app. By embedding tracking pixels on third-party websites, TikTok can collect information about a website’s visitors, the studies have found. TikTok has said it uses the data to bolster its advertising business. And in this respect, TikTok is not unique: the same tool is used by US tech giants including Facebook-parent Meta and Google on a far larger scale, according to Malwarebytes, a leading cybersecurity firm. At the hearing, Chew said the company does keystroke logging to “identify bots,” not to track what users say. He also repeatedly noted that TikTok does not collect more user data than most of its peers in the industry. As with the keylogging tech, the fact TikTok uses tracking pixels does not on its own transform the company into a national security threat; the risk is that the Chinese government could compel or influence TikTok, through ByteDance, to abuse its data collection capabilities. Separately, a report last year found TikTok was spying on journalists, snooping on their user data and IP addresses to find out when or if certain reporters were sharing the same location as company employees. TikTok later confirmed the incident and ByteDance fired several employees who had improperly accessed the TikTok data of two journalists. The circumstances surrounding the incident suggest it was not the type of wide-scale, government-directed intelligence effort that US national security officials primarily fear. Instead, it appeared to be part of a specific internal effort by some ByteDance employees to hunt down leaks to the press, which may be deplorable but hardly uncommon for an organization under public scrutiny. (Nevertheless, the US government is reportedly investigating the incident.) Joyce, the NSA’s top cyber official, told reporters in December that what he really worries about is “large-scale influence” campaigns leveraging TikTok’s data, not “individualized targeting through [TikTok] to do malicious things.” To date, however, there’s no public evidence of that taking place. TikTok may collect an extensive amount of data, much of it quietly, but as far as researchers can tell, it isn’t any more invasive or illegal than what other US tech companies do. According to security experts, that’s more a reflection of the broad leeway we’ve given to tech companies in general to handle our data, not an issue that’s unique or specific to TikTok. “We have to trust that those companies are doing the right thing with the information and access we’ve provided them,” said Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, a longtime ethical hacker and Twitter’s former head of security who turned whistleblower. “We probably shouldn’t. And this comes down to a concern about the ultimate governance of these companies.” Lin told CNN that TikTok and other social media companies’ appetite for data highlights policy failures to pass strong privacy laws that regulate the tech industry writ large. “TikTok is only a product of the entire surveillance capitalism economy,” Lin said. “And governments around the world are ignoring their duty to protect citizens’ private information, allowing big tech companies to exploit user information for gain. Governments should try to better protect user information, instead of focusing on one particular app without good evidence.” Asked how he would advise policymakers to look at TikTok instead, Lin said: “What I would call for is more evidence-based policy.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[13,14],"topic_weights":[70,30],"title":"FAA is laying out steps for air traffic ","text":["The head of the nation’s air traffic controllers said there have been too many near collisions at airports and laid out steps to avoid more – including more supervisor oversight in control towers and extra controller training for “unusual circumstances.” “Even though we all know that multiple levels of safety are built into our system, there is no question that we are seeing too many close calls,” said Tim Arel, chief operating officer of the Federal Aviation Administration’s Air Traffic Organization. The five steps laid out Thursday by Arel in an agency-wide memo follow last week’s FAA safety summit focusing on the recent series of near collisions involving commercial airliners on or near the runways of US airports. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating six incidents this year alone. “Our dedication to continuous improvement demands that we dig deep to identify the underlying factors and address them,” Arel said. “With the summer travel season just around the corner, airlines and the traveling public have high expectations.” The steps laid out in the memo direct supervisors to “devote their full attention to the operation and airfield during peak traffic periods at each facility” and instruct improvements to training. The memo notes simulator training for controllers was “last updated in 2016.” Additional safety steps include working with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association to reinforce existing safety protocols and reexamining runway incursion data “to identify underlying factors that led to these close calls and identify remedies.” The most serious types of near-collisions on US runways this year are about double the rate seen in the past, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday. “In past years, they’ve occurred at roughly a rate of once per month,” he told a Senate committee. “Right now, they are this year occurring at a rate that is double that.” Buttigieg spoke specifically about the two most serious categories of runway incursions and said there’s a “definite increase.” “We think that the uptick is partly related to the especially fast surge in demand and the swift return to the skies – faster than even the most optimistic scenarios that we heard even a couple of years ago,” Buttigieg said. “We need to make sure of course that as that system comes back to that high level of demand there is no negative safety impact to that.” Despite the recent close calls at airports, flying remains an incredibly safe mode of travel. About 45,000 flights are typically completed each day in the US, all without a fatality. That’s a number that continues to rise following a slowdown of commercial flights at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Contributing to the FAA’s challenges is a significant understaffing of air traffic controllers. The air traffic controller union said it is working with agency officials on a permanent fix to the understaffing issues. The FAA paused hiring and training of air traffic controllers during the pandemic, but the hiring has since resumed. The facility controlling busy air space in the New York region is staffed at 54% of its target level, the FAA says. Nationwide, only 90% of air traffic control positions are filled. “We are critically staffed in most of our air traffic control facilities,” Richard Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told CNN. “It does impact efficiencies and redundancies and resiliency.” On Wednesday, the FAA acknowledged the shortage and loosened rules around airlines’ takeoff and landing slots at airports in the New York and Washington, DC, areas. It said the move is necessary because of “post-pandemic effects on Air Traffic Controller (ATC) staffing” in the New York center. The move allows airlines to temporarily suspend using the use-or-lose takeoff and landing positions at JFK, LaGuardia and Newark airports in the New York area, as well as the DC-area Reagan National. The FAA’s memo acknowledged that its staffing issue contributed to delays last summer, and said airlines appear to be scheduling more flights for this year. Based on the additional flights and staffing shortages, it forecast “overall delays increasing by 45 percent” in the peak summer months. “The staffing shortfalls at n90 (the New York facility) limit the FAA’s ability to provide expeditious services to aircraft operators and their passengers that traverse this airspace,” the FAA memo said.

Held deep in a forest in eastern Tennessee – home to towering pines, bulging mountains and a former maximum-security prison – the Barkley Marathons is thought by many to be the hardest, most brutal foot race in the world. The route is long and indistinguishable, the inclines are steep, and the terrain unforgiving, but that’s only if you’re able to navigate the opaque entry system and earn a spot on the start line in the first place. Sanchez, after months of careful preparation and more than 58 hours of toil on the course, has now conquered all this, becoming the first Frenchman, and 16th competitor, to complete all five loops of the Barkley between March 14 and 16. “I’m still having nightmares,” says Sanchez, who has now returned home to Toulouse and resumed his work as an electrical engineer. “I’m dreaming that I’m in my fifth loop but not focused anymore. I’m lost in the forest, it’s dark and I’m waking up in a panic because I know I’m not focused, and I need to be focused to finish.” It can hardly be the first time the Barkley has left an imprint on a runner’s brain. The race – between 100 and 130 miles long with 63,000 feet of elevation – has a dropout rate of 99%; prior to this year, there had been no finishers since 2017. The brainchild of Gary Cantrell, better known as Lazarus Lake or “Laz,” the Barkley is held annually in Frozen Head State Park and consists of five loops of around 20 miles each, although many believe the course to be several miles longer.  Inspiration for the race comes from James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King Jr. who escaped from Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in 1977. Ray traveled only eight miles in just over two days after escaping Brushy before he was recaptured, leading Cantrell, a local long-distance runner, to muse that he could cover 100 miles in the same amount of time. And so the Barkley was born, during which Cantrell sends a group of 40 runners into Frozen Head State Park to battle the woods, hills, and briars without the help of phones, GPS trackers, course markings or aid stations. A single map of the route is available at the start line for runners to study and copy down for themselves, and on the way around they must rip a page corresponding to their bib number from a selection of paperback books left on the course. For first-timers like Sanchez, navigation is the most fiendish part of the Barkley. “You really have to learn the course during the race,” he tells CNN Sport. “There are some sections that are really difficult to remember and to know perfectly. I still struggled in the fifth loop to get around and made a lot of mistakes.” The final loop was made even harder this year after a day hiker removed one of the 13 books from the course. Sanchez decided to dismantle a stack of stones at the checkpoint to prove he had passed through, but he was nonetheless relieved to see Cantrell holding the missing book at the end of the race. “Guillaume [Calmettes], my friend who was in camp at this time offered to replace a book because he had time to put it back,” says Sanchez. “But Laz didn’t want to, he said that it’s part of the race, so I had to deal with that.” Staving off sleep deprivation is another challenge of the Barkley. In the three days and two nights he was on the course, Sanchez slept for only 15 minutes – between the third and the fourth loops after 33 hours of running. “The second night I had a bit of a struggle,” he says. “I was feeling dizzy, I was not seeing right on the trail, I was not walking straight anymore.” Desperate to find more energy, Sanchez swallowed caffeine tablets, took on more food and water, and even tried screaming into the woods in an effort to reinvigorate himself. His race fuel consisted mainly of cheeseburgers – “it was such an amazing lot of calories going in – I enjoyed eating that,” says Sanchez – as well as candy, chocolate, cookie dough, cheese and fruit. A brief pause between each loop was also a chance to change his socks and shoes before returning to the course. “It’s like you start a new race,” says Sanchez. “It’s almost like the exhaustion goes away and you start fresh again on a new loop. And new socks are very important to avoid blisters as well.” This year’s Barkley Marathons, for only the second time ever, had three finishers: Sanchez, American John Kelly, who also completed all five loops in 2017, and Belgian Karel Sabbe, who finished just six-and-a-half minutes inside the 60-hour cutoff. For Sanchez, just to be able to compete in the Barkley, let alone finish the race, was to fulfill an ambition he had held for many years. An experienced ultrarunner, he has completed a 12-day crossing of the Pyrenees mountain range and holds the unsupported fastest known time (FKT) going south to north on the 211-mile John Muir Trail through the Sierra Nevada in California. But he calls the Barkley Marathons his greatest ultrarunning achievement having dreamed of taking part for the past six years. Sanchez spent the months leading up to the race training in the Pyrenees and started researching the race in meticulous detail – reviewing old race reports to learn how runners succeeded in the past, poring over Google Earth to understand the topography of the park, and reading up on how to manage sleep deprivation. All that preparation came to fruition during the 58 hours and 23 minutes he spent on the course. “It was the race of my life – everything clicked,” says Sanchez. “When I finished, I was feeling very, very emotional. “In the park, it’s very silent; you can hear only the trees and the wind. And then after a point, just 100 yards from the finish, you hear the crowds, the yelling and screaming, and it’s such a big emotion.” He adds, though, that the end of the race was bittersweet. Calmettes, his friend, training partner, and the former French record holder at the Barkley, had dropped out of the race on the third loop with an Achilles injury. But the experience has only reinforced Sanchez’s fascination with the Barkley. He hopes to compete again in the future, although exactly how you gain entry to the race is a secret he isn’t prepared to share. There’s no website, email or physical address posted anywhere, and part of the application process requires hopeful runners to write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete. If accepted, they receive a “letter of condolence” from Cantrell. “I was in tears when I received this letter,” says Sanchez. “I was very emotional. I was waiting for that for the last six years. “You decide what you want to say [in the application], it’s your story. I told him about my dedication for the last six years, that everything I did was around the Barkley and that I wanted to have the privilege one day to run it. “At some point, he decided that I deserved my chance.” Sanchez, who had to use his annual leave to compete in the Barkley, maintains that he has no desire to be a professional ultrarunner, preferring a “normal life” with his girlfriend, Lucille, to preparing for a big race each weekend. But he also sees ultrarunning as more than just a casual hobby, mainly because of the valuable lessons he’s learned by exploring his physical and mental limits. “I had a lot of failed projects in the last six years,” says Sanchez, which includes recording the John Muir Trail FKT on his third attempt. “It was very difficult, very tough to fail in some of the ways I failed, but I learned out of it. I learned that I was not the strongest person ever, that I had to deal with my weaknesses.” Which all sounds like excellent preparation for the Barkley Marathons – a race that exposes a runner’s weaknesses like few others.

They also believe the Muslim cleric is “one of the most influential English-speaking terrorists of our time,” Assistant District Attorney Gary Galperin said during opening statements at Faisal’s trial on state terrorism charges. Now, Faisal has been sentenced to 18 years in prison. A Manhattan court sentenced him Thursday after a nearly three-month trial in which he was found guilty of five terrorism-related charges. He is the first person to be tried under New York state terror laws passed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the district attorney’s office said. “Tragically, Manhattan will continue to be a target for those who want to harm this country,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “Working with our federal and state law enforcement partners, our office stands at the ready to continue combatting terrorism.” The sentencing was the culmination of a yearslong investigation by the NYPD’s Intelligence Bureau and the district attorney’s counterterrorism program. It spanned continents and involved stealth work by an undercover NYPD officer who gained Faisal’s trust by posing as a would-be jihadist. Communications between the officer and Faisal ultimately helped cement the case against a man whose reach extended far beyond his home in Jamaica, prosecutors say. He was found guilty on all five counts, including soliciting or providing support of an act of terrorism and conspiracy as a crime of terrorism – though Faisal’s defense team argued that he never took action and his preachings on Islam were just words. Faisal plans to appeal; at the sentencing, his attorney called the evidence against him “razor-thin.” Faisal is a Jamaican-born Muslim convert who radicalized while spending time in England in the late 1990s. He became a fixture at a London mosque where he gave fiery speeches on Islam. His charisma, coupled with his command of English, attracted hundreds of people to his sermons. Faisal was eventually deported from the UK after serving less than half of a nine-year sentence on charges of inciting hatred and soliciting the murder of Jews, Americans and Hindus. Eventually, he returned to his native Jamaica. “When ISIS kicked off in 2014 so did he, and his activities went from a lot of vitriol and hateful rhetoric to really energizing his commitment to mobilizing people to commit acts of violence and to join terrorist organizations,” said Rebecca Weiner, assistant commissioner of the NYPD’s Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureau. Faisal began publishing his hateful preaching and pushing violent extremism online, amassing a global network of followers, prosecutors say. “His lectures grew, they changed formats, they changed platforms,” Weiner said. “His rhetoric became much more uninhibited and more violent in nature.” Authorities say they can tie Faisal’s influence to a number of convicted terrorists. They include: Authorities also believe one of the 9/11 hijackers was inspired by Faisal’s teachings. Faisal’s name “kept coming up” in interviews with suspects as their inspiration and “that’s when we realized we needed to focus on him, focus on the people that were following him and try and arrest him,” said Chief Thomas Galati, who leads the counterterrorism bureau. The bureau’s investigation of Faisal was launched in early 2016. “We knew that (Faisal) was talking to people in New York City and we had some understanding that he was helping people leave the country and join ISIS by hooking them up with other people who could help them get into Syria,” Galati said. With that in mind, the investigators ultimately turned to a detective identified as Undercover Officer 716, who posed as a 25-year-old with medical training named “Mavish.” She began communicating with Faisal, enlisting his help to join the terrorist organization overseas. At first, she didn’t know the scope of Faisal’s impact, she told CNN in an exclusive interview. “I didn’t believe he had that much of an influence,” the officer said, “because the way he portrayed himself in social media and lectures was strict and he was just straight flirting (with me) and acting as a nonbeliever.” Text and email exchanges revealed in court show Faisal weaved from spreading his jihadist message to offering “Mavish” help in finding a suitable partner for her from the ranks of ISIS fighters. He even suggested she marry him. “I don’t want you to marry anybody else,” one text message read, “I want you for myself.” The officer said she would put the “uncomfortable” conversations to the back of her mind as she maintained her persona. “Let him hear what he wants to hear,” she would tell herself, “this is to protect all the innocent lives that could possibly get harmed if I don’t stay in character,” she told CNN. Faisal also gave her stern warnings about her communications, so as not to alert law enforcement. “Don’t mention these things on my fone (sic). I will get arrested,” text messages show. The correspondence lasted for months as the undercover officer traveled to Abu Dhabi and Jordan, at times making video calls with Faisal to show landmarks. He was trying to verify her identity, authorities say. “We were able to show him what he asked us to show him. That’s when he trusted us,” Galati said. That trust led Faisal to connect “Mavish” with an ISIS fighter on the front lines in Raqqa, Syria, who began collecting information from her and promised to help her gain entry to the Islamic State. In one voicemail, the fighter says, “give me your WhatsApp and your Telegram … and somebody from us will contact you.” Galati and his team traveled to Jamaica to arrest Faisal in 2017, according to NYPD. Even though he had never traveled to the United States, Manhattan prosecutors pursued the five terrorism-related charges against Faisal, based on state laws passed in the aftermath of 9/11. After an extradition fight, Faisal was finally brought to the US in 2020. “This was someone who was the lead English-speaking operative for ISIS, he was projecting his vile message into Manhattan. His impact is clear,” Bragg, the district attorney, told CNN. “While he may not have set foot here, his message, his voice and his horrific impact did.” Undercover 716 saw Faisal for the first time when she testified in court against him. “When I saw him, I was happy that he was there because of the amount of people that he harmed, and we were able to get him,” she said.

The two new rules from Florida’s Boards of Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine prohibit medical professionals in the state from providing gender-affirming care to minors in the state with gender dysphoria, including by administering puberty blockers, providing cross-sex hormone therapy and performing “sex reassignment surgeries, or any other surgical procedures, that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics.” The rules provide an exception to the hormone therapy and puberty blocker provisions for minors that were undergoing such treatments prior to the effective date of the rules. The Board of Medicine’s rule went into effect on March 16 and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine’s rule goes into effect March 28. The plaintiffs in the case are four anonymous transgender minors in Florida and their parents. Only one of the plaintiffs – a 10-year-old trans girl – had been receiving some form of gender-affirming care at the time that the case was brought, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in Tallahassee.  The plaintiffs are being represented by several leading LGBTQ rights groups, including the Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. They name the state’s surgeon general and the two medical boards and its members as defendants. “The transgender medical bans are not narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest, substantially related to any important governmental interest, or even rationally related to a governmental interest. Accordingly, the transgender medical bans violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,” the lawsuit states, referring to the US Constitution. CNN has reached out to the state for comment on the lawsuit. LGBTQ advocates and many physicians regard gender-affirming care as medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known. Major medical associations agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria. Though the care is highly individualized, some children may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. Surgical interventions, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors. Lawmakers in Florida are currently considering legislation that would codify the rules that are now being challenged in court. A number of other GOP-led states have already put similar bans on their books, including Georgia and Iowa, which enacted bans on gender-affirming care this week. Tennessee, Mississippi, Utah and South Dakota have also enacted such bans this year. Meanwhile, bans passed in recent years in Alabama and Arkansas have been temporarily blocked by federal courts. In pushing the health care bans, Republicans have argued that decisions around such care should be made after an individual becomes an adult, though lawmakers in some states have sought to push bans as far back as the age of 26.

Authorities say Christa’s last known sighting was with her mother in September 1991 at a lodge near Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, when she was 2. The body of her mother, Christine Belusko, was found “brutally beaten, strangled, and burned” on Staten Island’s east shore in 1991, according to Richmond County District Attorney Michael E. McMahon. Investigative work combined with forensic genealogy was used to confirm Belusko’s identity in April 2021. Her identity was made public this week, over three decades since her “brutal and depraved” murder, he said. “We have already notified (Belusko’s) family of her death and we continue to make all efforts to also locate Christa Nicole so we can let her know about who her mother was and what has been done to bring justice to this case,” McMahon said at a news conference Tuesday. Belusko was only 30 when her body – found face up, handcuffed, partially clothed and burned – was left in a vacant lot, according to David Nilsen, chief investigator for the Richmond County District Attorney’s Office. She was found with 17 blows to her head and a hammer was recovered at the scene, he said. “Despite the incredibly dedicated work of the NYPD at that time, authorities were unable to identify her or locate the person who took her life so savagely and viciously at such a young age,” McMahon said. “Nearly 30 years later, in a joint effort with the FBI, my incredible team of detective investigators working with the NYPD detectives picked up the case and working together, we employed the use of forensic genealogy technology unavailable in 1991, but invaluable in today’s law enforcement world to bring closure and justice to those touched by crime.” Once Belusko was identified, authorities reached out to her living relatives, including her brother, and found that she had a two-year-old daughter at the time of her death, Nilsen said. An age progression photo of Christa was released Tuesday and the search for Belusko’s killer and the whereabouts of her daughter continues. There is currently no known information on who Christa’s father is, McMahon said. “We are seeking the public’s assistance to solve the homicide of Christine Belusko and determine the whereabouts of Christa Nicole,” Nilsen said.  Until she was identified, Belusko was only known as the “the girl with the scorpion tattoo” for decades, McMahon said, referring to a distinctive scorpion tattoo found on her body. Investigators believe the hammer recovered at the scene – found under Belusko’s body and with “Loyd L” engraved on the handle – was used in her murder, Nilsen said. Police were initially unable to identify the killer or the victim, leaving the case unsolved. An individual with the name “Loyd L” was identified, but “that’s as far as it got,” McMahon said. “There was no other indication that he was involved. He couldn’t be prosecuted or exonerated at that time given the circumstances that we knew,” McMahon said, adding that the individual is no longer living. In 2008, the DA’s office revisited the homicide case and submitted her DNA and her dental records to the FBI, but that didn’t result in any new leads. The case was revisited again in 2019 when McMahon decided to use forensic genealogy technology in a joint effort with the FBI, NYPD and New York Medical Examiner’s Office, resulting in Belusko’s identification around two years later, Nilsen said. Prior to her death, Belusko lived in Clifton, New Jersey, and worked for a clothing store, McMahon and Nilsen said. Belusko was placed for adoption when she was an infant and was raised by a New Jersey couple, James Clinton, a spokesperson for the Richmond County DA’s office said. After she found out she was adopted, she left home in July 1991 and briefly stayed at the Mount Airy Lodge in the Poconos in Pennsylvania, Clinton confirmed. None of Belusko’s family members knew she was murdered, assuming she was safely living in Florida, according to The Charley Project, an organization that tracks missing people. While the investigation into her murder is ongoing, McMahon said investigators believe her killer was known to her. “There’s absolutely no indication that this was done by anyone other than someone who knew her, given the facts of the case and what transpired in the way that she was murdered… That certainly makes us think that this was someone who knew her. It’s an intimate type of murder,” McMahon said.

A three-judge panel of the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals had thrown the case out in December, agreeing with a district court’s ruling that the challengers lacked the procedural threshold – known as standing – needed to bring the suit. But the full court of over a dozen members is now set to hear an appeal. The plaintiffs in the Connecticut case – all of whom have now graduated from high school – are not asking the appeals court to say the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference’s policy is unlawful. Instead, they’re trying to get a chance to bring their suit in the first place. The plaintiffs claim they were put at an athletic disadvantage because they had to compete against two trans athletes in the state as a result of the CIAC policy. If the appeals court says they have standing in the matter, they’ll be able to bring their suit back to the district court so that they can again ask the court to change their athletic records to their liking. Conservatives have in recent years seized on the case as they’ve pushed state bills seeking to prohibit trans girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity. And the rehearing is playing out just as another high-profile case related to the inclusion of trans athletes in school sports has landed before the US Supreme Court. In court papers filed Thursday, attorneys for the athletes told the court that the “injustice that began on the track followed the female athletes to the courtroom.” “Only the en banc court can vindicate plaintiffs’ Article III standing and their right to seek damages and prospective relief for the CIAC policy’s lasting harms,” the attorneys wrote in their brief. “CIAC’s own policies demonstrate that correcting students’ athletic records after the fact is both possible and necessary to address the effect of unfair competition. And the highest levels of competitive sport show that society highly values corrected athletic medals and records, no matter how long it takes to get them right,” the brief said. The court has asked attorneys representing the state and two trans athletes that intervened in the case to submit their own brief by early April. In the appeals court’s December ruling, the judges said the plaintiffs’ claim that the CIAC policy put them at a competitive disadvantage was unfounded. “All four plaintiffs regularly competed at state track championships as high school athletes, where plaintiffs had the opportunity to compete for state titles in different events. And, on numerous occasions, plaintiffs were indeed ‘champions,’ finishing first in various events, even sometimes when competing against (Andraya) Yearwood and (Terry) Miller,” the ruling said, referring to the two trans athletes the plaintiffs had competed against. “Plaintiffs simply have not been deprived of a ‘chance to be champions,’” the judges wrote. “It’s exceedingly clear here that that the Connecticut policy does not violate Title IX,” said Josh Block, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the two trans athletes who joined the suit to defend the state’s policy. “That these plaintiffs, far from having been denied educational opportunities, have had an abundance of them in high school, winning scores of awards and champion scholarships,” he continued. “And that allowing transgender girls to participate, you know, has not affected their own athletic opportunities.” Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for early June.

Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday to ban certain gender-affirming care for minors, joining a growing number of GOP-led states looking to restrict the treatments across the country. Senate Bill 140 will bar licensed medical professionals in Georgia from providing patients under the age of 18 with hormone therapy or surgery related to gender transition. Violations of the legislation could lead to the revocation of a health practitioner’s license. Kemp announced the signing in a tweet, saying that the law would “ensure we protect the health and wellbeing of Georgia’s children.” “As Georgians, parents, and elected leaders, it is our highest responsibility to safeguard the bright, promising futures of our kids - and SB 140 takes an important step in fulfilling that mission,” he said. LGBTQ advocates, however, have expressed concern over restricting access to such treatment, which is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender, the gender by which one wants to be known. “SB 140 will outlaw the care necessary to save children’s lives,” Rep. Nikema Williams, who chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia, said in a statement after the signing. “It is not only cruel, but it flies in the face of medical science, standards of patient care, and the lived experiences of those whom it impacts.” Democratic state Sen. Josh McLaurin shared similar concerns about the bill’s consequences for Georgia’s youth, after it passed in Georgia’s Senate Tuesday with a 31-21 vote. “Kids will commit suicide. Kids will feel like they’re not being heard, that their basic existence is being invalidated and erased,” McLaurin said. The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, noted in a 2022 report that 55% of transgender and nonbinary youth in Georgia “seriously considered suicide in the past year” and 16% attempted suicide in the same timeframe. While the bill grants exemptions to the law “for individuals born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development” and other medical conditions, it does not count gender dysphoria – a psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align, according to the American Psychiatric Association – among them. Minors who started hormone replacement therapy before July 1, 2023, will be allowed to continue the treatment under the new legislation. Cory Isaacson, a legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, warned ahead of the signing that the legal organization would sue the state over the law, claiming that Georgia’s politicians are “interfering with the rights of Georgia parents to get life-saving medical treatment for their children and preventing physicians from properly caring for their patients.” “The ACLU of Georgia and our partners will now consider all available legal options in order to protect the rights of parents, young people, and medical providers in our state,” she said Major medical associations agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria. Though the care is highly individualized, some children may decide to use reversible puberty suppression therapy. This part of the process may also include hormone therapy that can lead to gender-affirming physical change. Surgical interventions, however, are not typically done on children and many health care providers do not offer them to minors. The Georgia bill does not explicitly prohibit puberty blockers, breaking with similar bans across the country. Instead, the bill takes aim at hormone therapy that comes with more permanent effects than puberty blockers, according to The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which notes the treatment is shown to help transgender people with depression and boost self-esteem. Georgia’s legislation is similar in its goal to dozens of bills seeking to restrict access to gender-affirming care across the country, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union and shared with CNN. Some GOP-led states have already made restrictions on transgender youth’s access to health care in their states. On Wednesday, Iowa enacted its own ban on all forms of gender affirming care for minors, joining Tennessee, Mississippi, Utah and South Dakota, which passed their own bans earlier this year. Alabama, Arizona and Arkansas also enacted bans on gender-affirming care in recent years, though the laws in Alabama and Arkansas have been temporarily blocked by federal courts. Other potential bans are waiting in the wings, with Missouri’s Republican attorney general Monday announcing he would seek to implement an emergency regulation restricting gender-affirming care. Kentucky’s Republican-led legislature passed its own ban earlier this month while boasting a majority that could overturn the likely veto of its Democratic governor. That bill would also allow educators to refuse to refer to transgender students by their preferred pronouns and would not allow schools to discuss sexual orientation or gender identity with students of any age.

The demand for the dissent cable sent by US diplomats in Kabul in mid-July 2021 is part of McCaul’s push to investigate the chaotic departure of US military and government from Afghanistan after nearly two decades of war. The frenzied final weeks, during which a suicide bomber attacked the Kabul airport and killed 13 US service members and more than 100 Afghans, has been under immense scrutiny from Republican lawmakers since unfolding. McCaul has repeatedly warned that he would issue a subpoena if the State Department failed to share what he determined were three priority items: the cable, the after action report looking at the withdrawal, and the embassy evacuation plans. A committee aide said they received the last item, and Blinken said Wednesday that the after action report would be given to Congress in the coming weeks. At a committee hearing Thursday, McCaul told Blinken, “I’m gonna give you until the close of business on Monday to produce that dissent cable to this committee and this Congress so the American people can see what the employees at the Embassy in Kabul were thinking about your policy that they dissented from.” “This committee and the American people – after what happened, for God’s sake after what happened in that dreadful August – need to see this cable,” the Texas Republican said. “We need you to respond, and if you fail, I am prepared to serve you with the subpoena.” Blinken seemed to indicate that the Department would not willingly hand over the dissent cable document itself, and instead offered “to make the relevant information in that cable available, including through a briefing or some other mechanism.” “By our regulations, these cables may only be shared with senior officials in the department,” Blinken explained. “That’s to protect the integrity of the process, to make sure we don’t have a chilling effect on those who might want to come forward knowing that they will have their identities protected, and that they can do so again without fear or favor,” he added. The chairman rebuffed Blinken’s argument for the need for an “accommodation” on the matter, countering that Blinken does “not have an executive privilege on this cable.” McCaul said the State Department had “cited then Secretary Henry Kissinger’s refusal to produce a dissent cable to Congress in the 1970s as a precedent.” The author of that cable, according to McCaul, said that claims that sharing the cable would have a chilling effect are “bullsh*t.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[9,0],"topic_weights":[94,6],"title":"Gwyneth Paltrow could take stand in ski ","text":["Actress Gwyneth Paltrow took the stand to testify on Friday in a Utah trial over a 2016 snow skiing accident, painting a picture of her version of events relating to the incident over roughly two hours of testimony. The actress and businesswoman has been present in the courtroom since the trial began on Tuesday when lawyers representing Paltrow and Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, presented their opening statements to a seated jury. Sanderson has accused Paltrow of crashing into him and causing him lasting injuries and brain damage while they were both skiing on a beginner’s run on a Utah mountain in February of 2016. Sanderson also claims Paltrow and her ski instructor skied away after the incident without getting him medical care. Paltrow filed a countersuit against Sanderson in 2019 claiming that he skied into her. The two have been in a legal battle for seven years. Paltrow took the stand just before 3pm local time and was questioned by Sanderson’s attorney, Kristin A. VanOrman. The Goop founder said on the day of the collision with Sanderson, she was skiing with her two kids, then-boyfriend Brad Falchuk and his two children. The trip, Paltrow said, was the first time she and now-husband Falchuk were introducing their children to each other, in hopes of seeing if they collectively had a future as a “blended family.” The collision happened on the first day of their trip to Deer Valley Resort, she said. All of the children, who are around the same age, were taking a ski lesson on the day of the crash, Paltrow said. She testified that while she didn’t recall the exact cost of the lessons, they spent several thousand dollars, plus tips, for the lessons. When asked if she was a good tipper, Paltrow answered, “yes.” Paltrow then repeated her assertion that Sanderson skied directly into her back and caused the collision. “He struck me in the back, yes, that’s exactly what happened,” Paltrow said, as the lawyer read back a portion of her description of the events from a deposition. At one point, VanOrman had hoped to use Paltrow in a courtroom reenactment of the ski crash but had to settle for acting out the scenario herself after the judge rejected the idea. Paltrow testified that she was trying to figure out what was happening in the moments during and directly after the collision with Sanderson, describing him as making grunting noises. She testified Friday that two skis came in between her skis, forcing her legs apart and then “there was a body pressing against me and there was a very strange grunting noise.” VanOrman walked around the courtroom trying to demonstrate where the skis were and how Paltrow and Sanderson were positioned, based on how Paltrow described the incident. Paltrow said that at one point during the incident, she didn’t know if it was an accident and froze. They both came crashing down together, Paltrow said, confirming that her knee and both of their skis were tangled up. In her deposition, being read by the lawyer, Paltrow said “our bodies were almost spooning and I moved away quickly.” Paltrow said she did not ask about the condition of Sanderson after they collided, but claimed she stayed on the mountain “long enough for him to say that he was OK” and to stand up. Paltrow apologized for using profanity and yelling at Sanderson after the collision. “I was very upset, and it was still very strange to me what had happened,” she said. “I was very angry at what had happened.” She said after the accident, her knee felt like it had been “over-stretched” and her “back hurt,” but she did not seek medical care, opting instead to get a massage. When later asked if she believed the testimony given by Craig Ramon, Sanderson’s friend who was on the slopes the day of the collision and testified Tuesday,  Paltrow said she did not. Ramon is the only eyewitness to the accident, according to Sanderson’s legal team. Sanderson had initially sued Paltrow for $3.1 million dollars, but later amended his complaint and is now seeking more than $300,000 in damages, according to court documents. Paltrow is seeking $1 in damages, plus attorneys’ fees. VanOrman asked if the $1 that Paltrow was seeking was inspired by a 2017 case involving singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, but Paltrow said that she had not been aware of Swift’s case at the time. “Are you good friends with Taylor Swift,” VanOrman asked. Paltrow answered, “No.” She added: “I would not say we’re good friends. We are friendly. I’ve taken my kids to one of her concerts before, but we don’t talk very often.” The pop star won a lawsuit in 2017 against radio host David Mueller, who she had said groped her at a meet-and-greet event in June 2013. Mueller was required to pay $1 in damages. VanOrman asked Paltrow whether or not the damages she was seeking was symbolic, to which Paltrow answered: “It’s symbolic because the damages would actually be more.” Upon questioning by her legal team, Paltrow was asked if she had sympathy for Sanderson. Paltrow said, “You know, I really do.” “I feel very sorry for him. It seems like he’s had a very difficult life, but I did not cause the accident so I cannot be at fault for anything that subsequently happened to him,” she testified. In the days since the trial began, a series of witnesses have testified. Friday’s proceedings kicked off with the conclusion of videotaped testimony given by Richard Boehme, a biomedical engineer, who acted as an expert witness. Mark Herath, a longtime friend of Sanderson and avid skier, then took the stand, speaking to Sanderson’s skiing skills prior to the accident, among other subjects. Sanderson’s daughter, Shae Sanderson Herath, took the stand shortly before noon local time. Sanderson Herath is married to Mark Herath’s brother. Sanderson Herath said on the stand that her father “doesn’t trust his brain anymore.” “From his daughter’s perspective, I feel that his life is exhausting,” she said. Radiologist Wendell Gibby testified on Wednesday that Sanderson “deteriorated” after the collision and stopped doing many of the activities he did prior to the incident. The jury also heard expert witness testimony from neuropsychologist Sam Goldstein, who evaluated Sanderson in 2020 and testified about various shifts in Sanderson’s mental health since the collision. On Thursday, Sanderson’s daughter Polly Sanderson Grasham gave emotional testimony about how a year and a half after the crash, she noticed her father’s “processing speed” appeared to have changed. Sanderson Grasham later said her father is a “principled man” and that she believes that he wants “someone to at least apologize or acknowledge or be held accountable for their decision that day.” Video depositions of Alina K. Fong, a clinical neuropsychologist who treated Sanderson following the collision, and Richard Boehme, a biomedical engineer who testified as an expert witness, were also played for the jury on Thursday. Boehme evaluated Sanderson in 2021 and testified that he believed the injuries Sanderson sustained to his ribs could have only been the result of being struck from behind. In the court documents originally filed by Sanderson and obtained by CNN in 2019, Sanderson stated that while skiing at Deer Valley Resort, Paltrow allegedly “skied out of control … knocking him down hard, knocking him out, and causing a brain injury, and four broken ribs and other serious injuries.” According to Paltrow’s countersuit, she “was enjoying skiing with her family on vacation in Utah, when Plaintiff – who was uphill from Ms. Paltrow – plowed into her back. She sustained a full ‘body blow.’ Ms. Paltrow was angry with Plaintiff, and said so. Plaintiff apologized. She was shaken and upset, and quit skiing for the day even though it was still morning.” Court is expected to resume on Monday.

Fong said she first saw Sanderson in May 2017 and described him as complaining of a “myriad of symptoms,” including cognitive issues, fatigue, mood and personality changes, pain and headaches. “By the time I saw him, he was struggling with these concussive symptoms for almost a year and a half,” she testified.

Sanderson’s middle daughter, Polly Sanderson Grasham, 49, testified that prior to the accident her father was “a goer.” “I think people would describe him as fun loving, very gregarious, definitely an extrovert,” she said. “(He) enjoyed people, dancing, outdoor activity.” In testimony that at times turned emotional, Sanderson Grasham, who lives in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, said a year and a half after the crash, she noticed her father’s “processing speed” appeared to have changed. She described once seeing him sitting in a chair by a window in her house and said she “almost expected drool to be coming out of his mouth.” “First of all, he wasn’t engaged with anybody,” she said. “He had kind of taken himself to a remote corner.

Biden issued the first veto of his presidency Monday on a resolution to overturn a retirement investment rule that allows managers of retirement funds to consider the impact of climate change and other environmental, social and governance factors when picking investments. A two-thirds majority vote would have been needed in both chambers of Congress to override the veto – a high threshold to meet. The final vote on the effort to override the veto was 219 to 200. Republican lawmakers led the effort to overturn the investment rule, arguing it pushes a liberal agenda on Americans and will hurt retirees’ bottom lines. Democrats argue it’s not about political ideology, it’s not a mandate and it will help investors. The resolution, which would rescind a Department of Labor rule, passed both chambers of Congress with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana voting with Republicans in the Senate. Biden argued the GOP-backed measure to overturn the rule would put retirement savings at risk. “This bill would risk your retirement savings by making it illegal to consider risk factors MAGA House Republicans don’t like,” Biden tweeted as he announced the veto. The veto from Biden reflects the reality of a changed political order in Washington with Republicans now in control of the House after they won back the chamber from Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections. Previously, Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate. Now, the president’s party only has a majority in the Senate. Most legislation passed by the current GOP-controlled House will not be able to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the resolution to overturn the investment rule only needed a simple majority to pass in the Senate. Republican lawmakers advanced it under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to roll back regulations from the executive branch without needing to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate that is necessary for most legislation.

The Senate is not expected to take up the bill and Democrats have criticized it an attempt to turn the classroom into a political battleground. The final tally was 213 to 208, with five Republicans crossing over to vote with all the Democrats against the bill. Among other things, H.R. 5, also known as the “Parents Bill of Rights Act,” would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require schools to provide parents with a list of books and reading materials available in the school library as well as posting curriculum publicly. It would also require elementary and middle schools that receive federal funding to obtain parental consent before “changing a minor child’s gender markers, pronouns, or preferred name on any school form; or allowing a child to change the child’s sex-based accommodations, including locker rooms or bathrooms.” Additionally, the legislation affirms parents’ rights to address school boards and receive information about violent activity in their child’s school. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the Republican bill “will not see the light of day” in the Senate and has called the legislation “Orwellian to the core.” In remarks on the Senate floor Thursday, Schumer described the measure as a “school control bill.” “If passed, schools across the nation would be forced to adhere to a panoply of federal regulations that take power away from parents and school districts. Again, let me repeat that: it would take power away from parents and school districts, away from educators, and put it in the hands of elected politicians. Again, the GOP that treasured small government, local control, is long since gone, replaced once again, by hard right MAGA ideologues,” Schumer said. House Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was upbeat leaving the vote because Republicans lost five votes while Democrat lost zero. “They don’t want to ban books,” he said In a news conference after the vote, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said, “In this bill we say, parents have a right to be heard. They should be able to go to school board meetings and not be called terrorists.”  For Republicans, parental rights in education emerged as a significant political issue during the Covid-19 pandemic, when school closures, along with mask and vaccine mandates, upended family routines and renewed scrutiny over school leadership. The issue gained prominence for Republicans after Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia’s 2021 gubernatorial election following a campaign that placed “parents’ rights” at its center. Republicans across the country, arguing that discussions around race, gender identity and sexuality are inappropriate for young children, have used the banner of “parental rights” to push for a curtailment of such conversations in schools, even though opinions on the matter vary widely among parents. Critics have broadly argued Republicans have used the issue to turn the classroom into a battleground and advance a political agenda. LGBTQ rights advocates, in particular, have argued it is a conscious effort to stigmatize a vulnerable slice of American society and could have a chilling effect on what they believe to be urgently needed discussions. In some states, such as Texas, Florida and Iowa, parental permission is now needed to discuss certain topics with students. Other states, such as Georgia, have put parents and school communities in charge of vetting books their children could encounter at school for signs of race-related or sexual themes, appealing to conservatives who have voiced concerns about “radical” literature. “I think the pandemic brought to light for a lot of us moms and dads, for the first time ever, we sat down and we saw what our children were being taught through the virtual classroom. And when we saw that, so many of us were disheartened with what we were viewing – and so then we did the right thing, right? We went to our school boards and voiced our displeasure, but we were turned away,” Republican Rep. Julia Letlow of Louisiana, who sponsored the House legislation, said earlier this month. Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, has denounced the bill previously telling CNN, “Parents and voters agree that elected leaders should be focused on getting students the individualized support they need, keeping guns out of schools, and addressing educator shortages.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[15,1,3],"topic_weights":[41,39,19],"title":"Huge French pension reform protests give","text":["More than a million people took to the streets across France on Thursday with protests turning violent in some areas as demonstrators voiced their fury at proposed pension reforms. Clashes between groups of protesters and police broke out after workers staged a national strike throughout Thursday, with flare-ups in Paris and regional capitals. French police said around 1,000 people acted “violently,” setting fires, launching smoke bombs and damaging property. In the southwestern city of Bordeaux, protesters set fire to the entrance of the city hall during ongoing clashes with police, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Police fired tear gas at crowds in northwestern Lorient, while video from Rennes shows authorities using water cannons to disperse protesters. At least 80 people were arrested and 123 police officers injured in France on Thursday during the nationwide protests, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. Thursday was the ninth day of strikes in the country and the first of coordinated action since French President Emmanuel Macron’s government pushed a bill to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64 through parliament without a vote last week. The mostly peaceful day of strike action – which saw 119,000 people march in Paris, according to the Interior Ministry – disrupted transport networks, oil refineries and schools. It also affected air traffic, with 30% of flights impacted at Paris Orly airport. Unionized workers blockaded a major oil refinery in Normandy and another one in Fos-sur-Mer in the south of the country, according to a government spokesperson. And earlier in the day, about 70 protesters blocked terminal one at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport, an airport spokesperson told CNN. Ahead of the strike, French authorities had mobilized 12,000 police officers throughout the country, including 5,000 in Paris.  France’s eight major trade unions announced a further nationwide protest for March 28, and called for local disruptive action over the weekend. “The responsibility for this explosive situation lies not with the unions but with the government,” they said in a televised statement. Britain’s King Charles had been due to visit Bordeaux on March 28 during his first foreign state visit as monarch, but on Friday the trip was postponed. “In view of yesterday’s announcement of a new national day of action against pension reform on Tuesday, March 28 in France, the visit of King Charles III, originally scheduled for March 26-29 in our country, will be postponed,” the Élysée Palace announced in a statement Friday. “This decision was taken by the French and British governments, after a telephone exchange between the President of the Republic and the King this morning, in order to be able to welcome His Majesty King Charles III in conditions that correspond to our friendly relationship. This state visit will be rescheduled as soon as possible,” the statement continued.    The French government’s plan to raise the retirement age for most workers by two years was opposed by huge numbers of people. Despite protests, Macron’s government has not backed down. It rammed the legislation through the French National Assembly last week using a constitutional clause that allows the government to bypass a vote.  The country’s generous pension system and early retirement have been a point of pride since they were enacted after World War II. Under the new law, the retirement age for most workers will be 64, still one of the lowest in the industrialized world. When the proposal was unveiled in January, the government said the reforms were necessary to prevent a projected 13.5 billion euro ($14.7 billion) hole opening up in the pension system in 2030. Thursday’s demonstrations come after Macron defended the reforms in an interview on French television on Wednesday, confirming they would be implemented by the end of the year. “It’s in the greater interest of the country. Between opinion polls and the national interest, I chose the national interest,” Macron said. But government critics and Macron’s detractors were incensed. “[Macron] has added fuel to the fire,” Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the CGT, France’s largest union, told French broadcaster LCI on Thursday.

India’s lower house, the Lok Sabha, said in a statement that Rahul Gandhi “stands disqualified from the membership,” citing his recent conviction. It is the second setback in as many days for India’s opposition Congress party and could neuter one of the few figures that has the kind of star power and name recognition to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On Thursday, Gandhi was found guilty of defamation by a court in western state of Gujarat for a speech he made in 2019, in which he referred to thieves as having the same surname as Modi. The 52-year-old politician was granted bail, according to his Congress party, which decried his conviction, accusing Modi of using the courts to silence his critics. “Everyone knows that Rahul Gandhi… is raising his voice against the dictator. He’s showing the courage to call out what is wrong,” the party said in a statement on Thursday. The conviction opened up an opportunity for his opponents, particularly within Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Under Indian law, a member of parliament can be disqualified for offenses such as “promoting enmity between two groups, bribery and undue influence or personation at an election.” If a lawmaker is convicted for any other offense and sentenced to a period of two years or more, they can also be disqualified. “He (Gandhi) stands convicted and as per law conviction leads to automatic disqualification. The Congress knows this,” BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya told CNN affiliate News18. Following his disqualification Gandhi will be unable to contest future elections unless his sentence is either stayed or he is acquitted. “We will fight this battle both legally and politically. We will not be intimidated or silenced,” senior Congress politician Jairam Ramesh tweeted. Indian parties from across the political spectrum have condemned Gandhi’s disqualification as an MP. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state and chairperson of the All India Trinamool Congress, tweeted, “In PM Modi’s New India, opposition leaders have become the prime target of BJP! While BJP leaders with criminal antecedents are inducted into the cabinet, Opposition leaders are disqualified for their speeches. Today, we have witnessed a new low for our constitutional democracy.” MP Derek O’Brien, also of the All India Trinamool Congress, posted a video on Twitter, saying, “The BJP is desperate to silence the voice of the opposition… We know they will go to all kinds of lows but this is the low of the low… BJP, shame on you.” Manoj Jha, an MP with the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal party, wrote on Twitter that democracy had been “declared dead.” “How bizarre and obnoxious. Shamelessness has got a new address. Yet don’t say democracy is dead in India. Parties in opposition must see that it is not about ‘elections’ alone but the fight must be to resuscitate democracy…” Jha wrote in a separate tweet. Shashi Tharoor, an MP from Gandhi’s party, expressed his shock on Twitter, saying: “I’m stunned by this action and by its rapidity, within 24 hours of the court verdict and while an appeal was known to be in process. This is politics with the gloves off and it bodes ill for our democracy.” Gandhi stood against Modi to contest the country’s top seat in the 2019 general election but he lost heavily. He subsequently stepped down as Congress’ president but remains an influential figure within the party. He is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India’s first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country’s founding Prime Minister. His grandmother was assassinated while in office, and his father was killed by a bomb blast while he was campaigning in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

Gandhi was present at the court in Surat, a city in Gujarat, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state. He was given bail and the sentence was suspended for 30 days. The criminal defamation case was filed against Gandhi by a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), after a speech during the 2019 general election in which he referred to the surname Modi and asked how all thieves had the surname. “The court has found Rahul Gandhi’s comment to be defamatory. The court found him guilty under IPC section 499 read with 500. He has been sentenced to two years in jail,” Ketan Reshamwala, advocate for complainant Purnesh Modi, said. Gandhi said in court that he had made the comment to highlight corruption and not against any community.  Gandhi is one of the main opposition leaders in the country who will go up against Modi when he seeks his third term as prime minister in 2024. Gandhi’s once-dominant Congress controls less than 10% of the elected seats in parliament’s lower house and has lost badly to the BJP in two successive general elections, most recently in 2019.

Five officers with the New Haven Police Department were arrested and charged with second degree reckless endangerment in November 2022, CNN previously reported. The police were transporting Cox, who was arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing a handgun, in the back of a police van when he was injured. Video during the transport shows Cox, who was handcuffed, hit his neck and back on the back wall of the van after an abrupt stop, leaving him paralyzed. The five officers pleaded not guilty in January, according to CNN affiliate WFSB. The officers were identified by the New Haven State’s Attorney’s Office as Officer Oscar Diaz, Officer Jocelyn Lavandier, Officer Ronald Pressley, Officer Luis Rivera and Sergeant Betsy Segui. Pressley retired from the department in January, CNN previously reported. CNN received the report on Wednesday from Lt. Manmeet Colon OIC, Office of the Internal Affairs with police.  The redacted report alleges the five officers violated several of the principles in the department’s policies, including but not limited to integrity, trustworthiness, courtesy, and respect. The investigation consisted of multiple interviews with the officers and an interview with Cox himself, as well as transcripts of video taken throughout Cox’s arrest and transport. The report includes claims that officers did not tell Cox to hold onto any of the safety loops in the back of the van, which had no seat belts. After the injury, Cox repeatedly called for help, telling officers, “I broke my neck.” When they arrived at the police station, officers dragged Cox out of the van by his ankles and placed him in a wheelchair. The document details policy violations committed by each officer charged. Among other claims, it alleges that Segui “showed a lack of compassion and remorse for Cox while he plead for help,” failed to intervene while other officers dragged him, was not wearing her body camera, and was untruthful in her interviews. It alleges that Diaz failed to call medical personnel or his supervisor about Cox’s injury and also failed to intervene while other officers dragged Cox. Lavandier likewise failed to intervene and also “showed lack of compassion as she dragged Cox by his ankles” and “ridiculed him for not even trying to move when he was physically unable to do so,” according to the report. The report alleges that both Rivera and Pressley, who retired in January, failed to intervene, showed a “lack of compassion” when they dragged Cox into the holding area and ignored his calls for help, and failed to activate their body cameras. The injury to his neck and spine left Cox paralyzed from the chest down, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump.

Kwon, a South Korean national, founded the blockchain platform behind the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister coin Luna. Both coins lost their value in a matter of days in May 2022, wiping about $40 billion from the crypto market and setting off panic across the speculative sector. Kwon’s identity was confirmed through a fingerprint match, Interpol’s national central bureau in Seoul told CNN on Friday. A day earlier, Montenegrin Internal Affairs Minister Filip Adžić wrote on social media that a man believed to be Kwon was arrested in the capital Podgorica. “He was arrested at the airport with counterfeit documentation and is wanted by several countries, including the USA, South Korea, and Singapore,” Adžić said in a Facebook post. Kwon was based in Singapore while running the blockchain platform Terraform Labs. Seoul prosecutors told CNN in December that the crypto entrepreneur was believed to be in Serbia, where he was in hiding after leaving Singapore via Dubai. In September, a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Kwon, after he was accused of fraud by investors in the country in the wake of the collapse of his company. Kwon has been charged with fraud and breaches of South Korea’s capital markets law. He said in October that he didn’t believe the charges were legitimate, and claimed they were “politically motivated.” The crypto developer has repeatedly claimed on Twitter that he was not “on the run,” but refused to disclose his whereabouts due to worries about his personal security. Terraform Labs was behind TerraUSD, a stablecoin which in theory was meant to retain a $1 price point.

CEO’s skewering bef","text":["Is TikTok’s time up? That’s the question coursing through the halls of Congress, Wall Street, and the public writ large after the social media company’s chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, waffled for hours before US lawmakers on Thursday. “TikTok’s fate in the US is on shakier ground than ever following lawmakers’ grueling questioning of Chew,” Insider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said. The 40-year-old Harvard-educated Chew was never going to get a warm welcome from US lawmakers. That much had been telegraphed ahead of Thursday’s hearing in the clearest possible manner. And Chew was well aware he would likely be greeted with a cold reception, which is why he spent hours and hours preparing over the last week for his first sworn testimony before US lawmakers. But it was striking how the TikTok chief flailed under aggressive questioning from both Republicans and Democrats, uniting the parties in a way that is rarely ever seen in American politics anymore. “Mr. Chew, welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress,” Republican Rep. Buddy Carter said. Democratic Rep. Tony Cárdenas echoed, “You have been one of the few members to unite this committee.” A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. To be clear, quite a few members of Congress were simply not interested in the facts. They were never going to be moved by anything Chew said. They had their talking points and were going to deploy them during their allotted time as cameras were rolling. They couldn’t care less about technical talk related to routing server traffic through Oracle. It was never going to matter or impact how they behaved. “Shou came prepared to answer questions from Congress, but, unfortunately, the day was dominated by political grandstanding that failed to acknowledge the real solutions already underway through Project Texas or productively address industry-wide issues of youth safety,” a TikTok spokesperson said after the hearing. That said, Chew needed to provide clear, direct answers to questions posed by lawmakers, particularly those regarding fears of potential Chinese authority over the company. Instead, his murky answers on questions pertaining to the Communist Party of China led to added confusion at times. Even if everything TikTok claims about firewalling US data from Chinese actors via Oracle’s Texas-based servers is true, it was evident from Thursday’s hearing that lawmakers simply don’t buy it. And that poses a serious problem for the company as it faces mounting calls for it to be outright banned. As Kara Swisher told me, “While the politicians on both sides were posing for the cameras and should have been scrutinizing US social media sites for years and passing laws to protect US consumers, TikTok is going to get the brunt of it and will now have only two choices, a spin or a ban.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[15,6,8],"topic_weights":[50,35,15],"title":"Israel passes law shielding Netanyahu fr","text":["Benjamin Netanyahu resisted calls to drop his controversial overhaul of Israel’s judiciary in a fiery televised address Thursday, hours after his government passed a law that was condemned by critics as an effort to protect his position. Israeli opposition politicians earlier condemned the new law, which would limit the ways a sitting prime minister can be declared unfit for office, describing it as a way to protect Netanyahu, who is facing an ongoing corruption trial. By a 61-to-47 final vote, the Knesset approved the bill that states that only the prime minister himself or the cabinet, with a two-thirds majority, can declare the leader unfit. The cabinet vote would then need to be ratified by a super majority in the parliament. Former Prime Minister Yair Lapid called the move a “disgraceful and corrupt personalized law” and said Netanyahu is “looking out only for himself.” Netanyahu later doubled down on his controversial plans to weaken Israel’s judiciary, despite long-running protests and interventions from international leaders – as well as concerns from Israel’s security and military establishment. “I am working to reach a solution and am attentive to the concerns of the other side. We have already made changes,” he said, pointing to a softening to the bill that would give the government power in appointing judges – a partial climbdown announced on Monday that was dismissed by critics as insufficient. Israeli media had earlier reported on Thursday afternoon that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, was going to announce he believes the judicial overhaul needs to be halted because of the damage it was doing to Israel military. Hundreds of Israeli reservists, including specially trained Air Force crew, had announced they would refuse calls to serve if the overhaul passed, as they would no longer feel that they’d be serving a democratic government. But Gallant was summoned to Netanyahu’s office for a meeting and announced he would delay his statement. “Instead of stopping the legislation and calming the situation, Netanyahu once again played the victim and continued to spread outrageous lies against the judicial system which have no basis in reality,” Lapid said in a statement on Thursday night. “Instead of blaming everyone else and casting aspersions on patriotic Israelis who are fighting for their children’s future, take responsibility for once,” he told Netanyahu. The law passed on Thursday states that “the authority to declare the Prime Minister incapacitated will only belong to the government or the Knesset and will only occur due to physical or mental incapacity,” a Knesset statement said on Thursday. The bill also prevents the Supreme Court from considering “a request to declare the incapacity of the Prime Minister.” “Given that a sitting prime minister derives his power and authority from the people through his representatives, this proposal reflects the existing concept according to which the removal of the leader against his will, will be determined by the people’s representatives alone without the involvement of an unelected arm,” the statement said.  It came a day after Israel’s Ambassador to the United States was summoned over a vote in the Knesset on Tuesday to roll back 2005 legislation that previously ordered the evacuation of four Israeli settlements established in the northern West Bank. Israel’s prime minister’s office later confirmed that no new settlements will be established in areas previously evacuated under the 2005 disengagement law, despite the repeals. In a statement, the prime minister’s office said the parliament’s “decision to repeal parts of the secession law brings an end to a discriminatory and humiliating law that prohibited Jews from living in the areas of northern Samaria, part of our historical homeland,” using the biblical name for part of the West Bank. “However, the government has no intention of establishing new settlements in these areas.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which treats the area as a closed military zone prohibiting Israeli civilians from entering, said it is still “learning the meanings of the bill and will act in accordance to the law.” Any changes to the area will not be executed without the IDF’s sign off. Under international law, the West Bank is considered occupied territory and settlements there illegal, which Israel disputes. In an interview with CNN’s Becky Anderson Wednesday, Labor Party leader Michaeli said, “I believe that the protests must be a sign of warning and the signals that are coming from Washington must be a red light to Benjamin Netanyahu and to make him stop what he’s doing in order to save not only Israeli democracy and the state of Israel, but relations with the US as well. “I can only hope that my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gets his act together as soon as possible and does not allow the US-Israel relations to come to a point that is dangerous for Israel, and that is not good for the region,” she continued. Michaeli said she opposed the legislation calling it a “very harmful and very dangerous decision.” “One of the drivers for this judicial coup that they’re trying to pass now is the settlers that have been wanting to bring down the Supreme Court of Israel for many, many years because they want to be able to do in the West Bank whatever they want to do,” she added. The opposition Israeli leader emphasized her party’s historic support for a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, giving a nod to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who signed the Oslo Accords with then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. She said the Labor Party knows how “closely attached” the conflict in the West Bank is with the judicial overhaul. Opposition figures have announced plans to challenge the law limiting the ways a sitting prime minister can be declared unfit in the Supreme Court. “Like thieves in the night, the coalition just passed a disgraceful and corrupt personalized law in response to a baseless rumour about recusal. Every citizen of Israel should know – days before Passover, while cost of living is soaring, Netanyahu is once more looking out only for himself,” Lapid said on Thursday. Michaeli said the law that was passed is “a shameful, disgraceful law whose whole purpose is prevent Netanyahu from being sent to prison.” “This is all that the coalition and this government are doing, with personal legislation and the regime coup. They are sacrificing the State of Israel in order to settle themselves under a corrupt government,” she said. Netanyahu’s new far-right government has charged ahead with controversial plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system by undermining the Supreme Court, weakening judicial oversight over policymaking. Netanyahu, who is the first sitting Israeli prime minister to appear in court as a defendant, is on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery. He denies any wrongdoing.  As part of a deal with the court to serve as a prime minister despite his ongoing trial, Netanyahu agreed to a conflict of interest declaration. The Attorney General then determined the declaration meant Netanyahu could not be involved in the policy making of the judicial overhaul. A petition is currently in front of the Israeli Supreme Court to declare Netanyahu unfit for office on the grounds he has violated that conflict of interest declaration. For months now, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have regularly taken to the streets to protest the overhaul, saying it will damage Israeli democracy. They’ve been joined by senior figures in Israel’s security, high-tech, financial and academic fields.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis repeatedly pressed a Fox News lawyer about the role of top executives in the editorial process. His questions dovetailed with Dominion’s claim that Murdoch knowingly let Fox News hosts book guests that would lie about the 2020 election. He asked Fox lawyers if Murdoch and other executives “had the power to stop” TV hosts from booking pro-Trump guests that they’ve deemed “problematic” because of their past election lies. But Erin Murphy, who represents Fox News and its parent company, insisted that the Murdochs weren’t involved in the broadcasts where Dominion was potentially defamed. She argued that the voting machine company has fallen far short of proving that the Murdochs played any direct role, and thus they can’t be held liable. “It’s not enough to show that (these executives) have the ability to step in,” Murphy said, telling the judge that “you have to bring it home to the person who is directly involved” and determine if “the one who makes the final call” acted with actual malice. The voting systems company wants Davis to force Murdoch and his son, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch, to testify at trial, which is set to begin next month. Fox opposes the request. “(Rupert Murdoch) holds a special role at Fox Corporation, that he may be able to be compelled to be here,” Davis said, though he stressed that he hasn’t made decisions on witnesses yet. He also said he’d consider letting some out-of-state witnesses testify live over video-conferencing. He added that “judges prefer live testimony if the witnesses are available.” After two days of pretrial hearings this week, the next step is for Davis to rule on “summary judgement.” Both sides have argued that they should be declared the winner of the case, without even holding a trial. Davis could issue his ruling at any time, and jury selection is scheduled to begin April 13. Dominion filed a $1.6 billion defamation suit against Fox News and its parent company, Fox Corporation, claiming that they destroyed its reputation by promoting the lie that it rigged the 2020 election to stop Donald Trump from serving a second term. The Fox entities deny wrongdoing, say they’re “proud” of their 2020 election coverage, and claim the $1.6 billion figure is wildly inflated. Fox News has maintained that it is “proud” of its 2020 coverage and has said Dominion’s lawsuit could weaken the First Amendment. Fox Corporation claims Dominion overstated its role in Fox News’ editorial coverage, and asked to be dropped from the suit. Davis rejected their motion. On Wednesday, Fox’s lawyers told the judge that Dominion had goosed the numbers to reach the eye-popping $1.6 billion figure. Murphy, the Fox lawyer, argued that Dominion is trying to have it both ways. First, she said, Dominion had claimed that “nobody could have believed” that it rigged the 2020 election, and therefore Fox was reckless when it gave airtime to those allegations. But when it was time to calculate damages for the lawsuit, Dominion had claimed they’re “going to go out of business because everybody believes this, and all of (their) customers believe this,” she said. “There’s a bit of cognitive dissonance,” Murphy said. She went on to argue that Dominion’s calculations were inflated because they assumed they “would’ve succeeded every single time in the future” when seeking new business. Fox has argued in court filings that Dominion is trying to generate media attention with the $1.6 billion figure, and noted that Dominion generated less than $11 million in annual earnings before 2020. In a statement after the hearing, a Dominion spokesperson told CNN that its calculations for damages were “based on industry-standard valuation metrics and conservative methodologies.” It’s possible that the parties will reach an out-of-court settlement before the trial begins. Still, the courtroom showdown that unfolded Tuesday and Wednesday served as a preview of what the trial might look like. A wide array of legal experts have described Dominion’s lawsuit as one of the most consequential defamation and First Amendment cases in recent memory. The hearings came weeks after hundreds of explosive emails and texts were made public as part of the case. These internal Fox messages showed that many of the on-air personalities, producers, editors, executives and even corporate owners thought the allegations against Dominion were “nuts,” “kooky” and “BS” – but the network gave airtime to the theories anyway. Dominion lawyers made use of these exhibits during the pretrial hearings this week. They showed text messages sent by Fox News star Tucker Carlson, where he accused Trump lawyer Sidney Powell of being a “liar.” They also showed emails that Murdoch sent to other executives. Evidence in the case – mainly from the emails and texts – has already established that Fox News executives, producers and hosts thought Powell and Rudy Giuliani were lying when they claimed Dominion flipped millions of votes to rig the election against then-President Donald Trump. Other internal Fox emails revealed that Rupert Murdoch thought Trump lost the election fair and square, and never believed the Dominion-related conspiracy theories. On Tuesday, the judge had tough questions for Fox and challenged some of their legal theories. He appeared to embrace some of Dominion’s arguments that specific Fox News personalities supported right-wing conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and weren’t acting as neutral journalists.

When she revealed that she is the mother of three children, Perry jokingly rose from her chair and acted like she was about to fall back on the table. “If Katy lays on the table, I think I’m gonna pass out,” Liebe said. “Honey, you’ve been laying on the table too much,” Perry quipped. That comment elicited backlash on social media from those who believed Perry was “mom shaming” Liebe. Liebe posted on her TikTok account saying people have been asking how she felt about the joke “that wasn’t super kind.” The aspiring singer said she felt that the incident was “embarrassing” and “hurtful.” “I did want to take this opportunity just to say I think that women supporting and uplifting other women is so cool and I think that mom-shaming is super lame and I think that it’s hard enough to be a mom and it’s hard enough to be a woman,” she said. “I also wanted to take this opportunity to say I see all of the young moms and just moms in general … keep loving your babies. Nobody deserves to feel crappy about that. I think that if you’re a good mama and you love your babies, that’s all that really matters. Other comments just don’t feel necessary.” CNN has reached out to Perry’s representatives for comment. Perry shares a two-year-old daughter with her fiancé, actor Orlando Bloom.

Both France’s Élysée Palace and Buckingham Palace confirmed the trip had been shelved on Friday morning. The British monarch and Queen Consort were supposed to visit the country from Sunday through Wednesday, and they would have traveled to Paris and the southwestern city of Bordeaux. However a decision to postpone the visit was made after demonstrations turned violent in some areas, including Bordeaux, on Thursday. Clashes between groups of protesters angry over proposed pension reforms and police broke out after workers staged a national strike throughout Thursday, with flare-ups in Paris and regional capitals. In Bordeaux, demonstrators set fire to the entrance of the city hall during skirmishes with police, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The Élysée Palace said in a statement that the King’s state visit “will be rescheduled as soon as possible.” “In view of yesterday’s announcement of a new national day of action against pension reform on Tuesday, March 28 in France, the visit of King Charles III, originally scheduled for March 26-29 in our country, will be postponed,” the statement read. “This decision was taken by the French and British governments, after a telephone exchange between the President of the Republic and the King this morning, in order to be able to welcome His Majesty King Charles III in conditions that correspond to our friendly relationship,” it continued. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed the postponement to CNN, adding: “Their Majesties greatly look forward to the opportunity to visit France as soon as dates can be found.” A UK government spokesperson also confirmed the King would not travel to France next week, adding that “this decision was taken with the consent of all parties, after the President of France asked the British Government to postpone the visit.” Charles and Camilla were due to travel from France to Germany on Wednesday for a state visit. The second leg of the trip is still expected to go ahead.

In the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, Messi and his Argentina teammates played on home soil for the first time since their World Cup triumph just over three months ago. They were given a hero’s welcome by more than 80,000 delirious fans inside River Plate’s iconic Estadio Monumental on a night of celebrations that likely lasted well into the morning. The players were presented with the World Cup trophy, which they paraded around the stadium after a 2-0 friendly win over Panama, as well as shirts embroidered with three gold stars to signify the country’s three World Cup triumphs. The players from the squad that won the World Cup in Qatar have all been called up to the national team for these two friendly fixtures against Panama and Curaçao to allow them to revel in their moment of glory. By the time kick-off came around, celebrations inside the stadium – which included DJs, bands, fireworks and an 80,000-strong singalong – had been ongoing for more than four hours, with the match itself becoming little more than a footnote. It took 78 minutes for Argentina to find the breakthrough against what was largely a Panama reserve team, with Thiago Almada opening the scoring. Then, with just a minute remaining, Messi’s moment of glory came as he secured the win with a stunning free kick. It was his 99th international goal and the 800th of his professional career. “I always dreamed of this moment, celebrating with you in my country Argentina, lifting the greatest thing which is the World Cup,” Messi said in the closing ceremony. “Let’s keep doing what we’re doing and enjoy this because we have been waiting a long time to win it again. Let’s enjoy the third star.” On the same night, Ronaldo broke the men’s record for most international appearances as he earned his 197th cap for Portugal in the team’s Euro 2024 qualifying win over Liechtenstein. The previous record of 196 was held by Kuwait forward Bader Al-Mutawa. Ronaldo scored two goals – a penalty and a stunning free kick – in the 4-0 win as Portugal’s campaign for off to the perfect start, with João Cancelo and Bernardo Silva also getting on the score sheet. The 38-year-old made his debut for Portugal way back in 2003 and has now notched a record 120 international goals. Elsewhere in Euro 2024 qualifying, Harry Kane exorcised some of the demons from Qatar by scoring a penalty to become England’s all-time leading goalscorer with 54 goals. After missing a penalty in the quarterfinals against France which would have drawn England level and given him the record, Kane said breaking the record from the spot “means a lot.” Wayne Rooney, who had held the record as England’s leading goalscorer since 2015, tweeted: “Congratulations to Harry Kane on becoming England’s all-time leading goalscorer. “I knew it wouldn’t take long but that was quick.

The Service Employees International Union Local 99, which represents about 30,000 Los Angeles school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers and other student services staff, said on social media the strike, which was supported by teachers and their union, was over, but “the fight for our schools continues.” The school district confirmed schools would be open. “All @LASchools will reopen this Friday, March 24. We are grateful for the assistance and support of our partners, and we look forward to seeing our students and employees back at school,” officials with the Los Angeles Unified School District tweeted. Thresa Thomas, a food service worker, said the strike was a step forward, according to the workers’ union news release. “By standing together on the picket lines, before the sun was up and through the wind and rain, we showed the district we are not afraid; we are stronger than ever,” Thomas said. “We won the respect we’ve been demanding and it feels like the whole world is finally listening.” School workers began picketing Tuesday with the support of the district’s teachers after nearly a year of unsuccessful negotiations with the school district. The strike ended with a large rally at the Los Angeles State Historic Park on Thursday.  Frustrated members of the workers’ union have said they feel undervalued by low wages, minimal staffing and inadequate hours even as they provide essential services to the school district’s 500,000 students. The union said workers’ average salary is $25,000, requiring many to work additional jobs. “We live in this weird paradox as workers that help feed children and yet we struggle to feed our own children,” union member Adrian Alverez told CNN affiliate KCAL. “We help students go to college, yet we don’t have enough money to send our kids to college.” The union has demanded “equitable wage increases, more full-time work, respectful treatment, and increased staffing levels for improved student services.” The United Teachers Los Angeles union, which is undergoing separate contact negotiations with the district, is honoring the workers’ strike and urged its 35,000 members to join picket lines and rallies. The district said Wednesday it had been “in conversation” with the school workers union and wants to “reach an agreement that honors the hard work of our employees, corrects historic inequities, maintains the financial stability of the District. District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho acknowledged Tuesday the strike was a result of a years-long “crescendo of frustration” on behalf of workers but told CNN, “We should not be depriving our students of an opportunity to learn.” The strike left many parents of students scrambling for child care options. “So far, my wife has planned to take a couple days off work and maybe stay home with the kids and I’m going to have to do more overtime,” parent Armando Basulto told KABC. Rachel Wagner, whose 9-year-old son attends school in Encino, told CNN she supports the workers’ actions and believes better pay would alleviate staffing shortages and decrease turnover. “At the end of the day, you know, their working conditions are our child’s learning conditions,” Wagner said.  After nearly a year of gridlocked negotiations, the district and union have yet to reach a bargain, though Carvalho told CNN the district is prepared to work toward a potentially “precedent-setting contract.” The two parties had planned to participate in a confidential mediation process Monday, but the union refused to come to the table after a district spokesperson shared details of the planned negotiations. Members of the Los Angeles schools’ support workers union are demanding, in part: • A 30% pay raise, plus an additional $2 an hour over next four years • Increased employment hours for part-time workers The latest offers announced by the Los Angeles school district on Monday included: • A 23% recurring pay increase, plus a 3% cash-in-hand bonus • A $20-an-hour minimum wage • Full health care benefits for those working at least four hours a day. “Years of substandard compensation levels that – quite frankly, in a community like Los Angeles where the cost of living (and) the cost of housing are so high – have put our workforce, particularly the lowest wage earners, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodial staff,  in a position where they cannot live in the communities where they work,” Carvalho told CNN. As classes remained on hold due to the strike, the district announced several measures to assist families, some of whom rely on the daily meals provided to their children at school.  Daytime supervision was available at more than 150 schools. Additionally, 30 recreation centers were hosting a Special Edition After School Club Program for elementary school students and 18 county recreation and park sites were hosting drop-in “Everybody Plays” programs with open gyms and recreation equipment. The Los Angeles County Zoo also provided free admission to district students and a “community Safari Day” program for elementary school students. On Monday, some families picked up six grab-and-go meals per student at two dozen distribution sites, though the city has since ended the program.

In the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, conspiracy theorists baselessly suggested that the assault was a so-called “false flag” operation staged by the federal government to make supporters of then-President Donald Trump look bad. As part of that conspiracy theory, some right-wing figures baselessly claimed Epps was part of a secret FBI plot to orchestrate the attack. Carlson has repeatedly breathed life into those conspiracies by giving them attention on his highly rated program. On many occasions, Carlson has specifically mentioned Epps on his show, and has played footage from January 6 of Epps at the Capitol. In a private deposition with the House committee that investigated January 6, Epps denied that he ever worked for the FBI or for federal law enforcement, according to a transcript of his interview. He told the committee he supported Trump in 2020 and attended the DC protest because he was concerned about widespread voter fraud. These denials from Epps are meaningful because it’s a crime to lie to Congress. Teter, the Epps attorney, described the conspiracy theories about his client as “nonsensical fantasies” that have been “disproven by videos and accounts by those attending the January 6th events.” “The consequences of your lies cannot be minimized,” Teter wrote in his letter to Carlson and Fox News. “Mr. and Mrs. Epps have been subjected to threats, intimidation, and harassment, resulting in significant economic and emotional damages. Each time Mr. Carlson and Fox News spreads more misinformation about Mr. Epps, the harm redoubles.” Spokespeople for Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This isn’t Teter’s first foray into the legal fallout from January 6. He has publicly pushed for professional accountability against lawyers who have spread election lies. He is the managing director of the 65 Project, a group that is trying to take disciplinary action against Trump-aligned attorneys who pushed bogus falsehoods about the election. The legal notice comes at a precarious time for Fox News, which is being sued for $1.6 billion in a monster defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems, an election technology company. Dominion has alleged in its lawsuit against Fox Corporation and Fox News that during the 2020 election the right-wing network “recklessly disregarded the truth” and pushed various pro-Trump conspiracy theories about the election technology company because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” Fox News has strongly disputed Dominion’s allegations. The lawsuit from Dominion has unearthed damning messages from Fox News executives and hosts that have shown the network peddled election lies to its audience that it knew were false. A Fox News producer earlier this week also filed a lawsuit against the network, alleging that the right-wing network’s lawyers coerced her into providing misleading testimony in the case.

In a new letter to Republican lawmakers who earlier this week had sought information about the probe, Leslie Dubeck, the general counsel for the district attorney’s office, told the GOP House committee leaders that they lacked a “legitimate basis for congressional inquiry” and she noted that their requests for information “only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene.” Dubeck called the Republicans’ claims that the probe was politically motivated “unfounded.” She added that, “regardless, the proper forum for such a challenge is the Courts of New York, which are equipped to consider and review such objections.” She requested that the committees meet and confer with Bragg’s office to discuss whether the House has a “legitimate legislative” purpose for what it is seeking and whether those records could be turned over without infringing on New York’s sovereign interests. The previous letter demanding information about Bragg’s investigation was sent Monday by House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Chairman James Comer and House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil, who criticized the hush money probe into Trump as an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.” Jordan told CNN “we’re reviewing the letter” when asked for his response to the letter from the general counsel of the Manhattan DA. Jordan repeated his answer when asked if he would subpoena Bragg. Comer told CNN the “Judiciary [committee] is the one that’s taking the lead on this” when asked about the Manhattan DA office’s response to the initial request from Congress. Comer explained that his panel has a large staff and enough resources to help the House Judiciary Committee “get the information.” Dubeck’s five-page response to the Republicans’ demands – which included testimony from Bragg as well as documents and communications related to the investigation – cited case law and legal arguments for why the GOP requests amounted to an “unlawful incursion into New York’s sovereignty.” She said that the Constitution’s 10th Amendment limited the federal government’s authority over local law enforcement and argued that Congress specially is not an executive branch entity with law enforcement powers. Pointing to laws protecting grand jury secrecy, she said that the House Republicans were seeking “non-public information about a pending criminal investigation, which is confidential under state law,”  and therefore, she argued, complying with the committees’ request would interfere with law enforcement. Dubeck also scoffed at the Republicans’ claims that they needed testimony from Bragg and the requested documents as part of a congressional review of federal public safety funds. Dubeck wrote, “the Letter does not suggest any way in which either the District Attorney’s testimony about his prosecutorial decisions or the documents and communications of former Assistant District Attorneys on a pending criminal investigation would shed light on that review.” But, she added, “nonetheless, to assist Congress in understanding the ways in which the DA’s Office has used federal funds, we are preparing and will submit a letter describing its use of federal funds.” CNN has reached out to the three House committees involved for comment.

About 300 firefighters from 50 departments dashed to the scene of the derailment in East Palestine on the night of February 3. Many of them were volunteers without hazmat training or specialized equipment. Officials investigating the derailment testified that these first responders weren’t able to access information about the chemicals that were in 11 overturned cars carrying hazardous materials. Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency investigating the crash, urged senators to consider meaningful changes to help inform exposed communities and first responders. “People deserve to know what chemicals are moving through their communities and how to stay safe in an emergency, That includes responders who risk their lives for each of us every single day. They deserve to be prepared,” Homendy said.  Studies have shown that firefighters have a higher rates of cancer compared with members of the general population because of toxic chemicals they’re exposed to on the job. These cancers include digestive, oral, lung and bladder cancers. A rare type of cancer called malignant mesothelioma is about twice as common in firefighters than in the general population, probably due to exposure to asbestos in burning buildings, for example. Cancer is now the leading cause of death for working firefighters, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Wednesday that he is very concerned about the long-term health of the firefighters who responded to the derailment. “They all need to be assessed,” he said. “There needs to be established a baseline, and they need to be assured that in five years or 10 years, there’s still a place where they could go.” “We look to the railroad to establish that fund,” DeWine said in testimony before the committee. The derailment occurred about 9 p.m. February 3, and the night air quickly filled with smoke. Visibility was poor, and some of the placards on overturned railcars had burned away, leaving responders clueless about what chemicals were spilling and catching fire around them. There’s an app, AskRail, meant to give users more information about the what’s on trains involved in accidents, but none of the first responders to the derailment in East Palestine had access to it, Homendy said. Even if they had been able to use it, the app lists what is in cars by their order on the train, and its information may have been of limited help to firefighters on the scene who were looking at cars that were “bunched up” and not in their normal order, said David Comstock, chief of the Ohio Western Reserve Fire District. There are better ways of getting urgent information to first responders, he told the senators. After auto accidents, for example, some telematic systems in cars transmit information about the crash to emergency dispatchers who can then send it to crews responding to the scene. “So en route to a motor vehicle accident, I know the car has flipped three times, airbags gone out, and it has information about that car – whether it’s an electric car, things I have to worry about,” Comstock said. No information like that was available to crews responding to the derailed train. “They didn’t have the information for quite a long time on what was on the train,” Homendy said. Facing criticism over its role in the response, the company that owns and operates the train, Norfolk Southern, has announced that it will create a new regional training center for first responders. CEO Alan Shaw repeated that pledge in his testimony Wednesday before the committee. The company also intends to expand its Operation Awareness & Response program, which travels its 22-state network to teach first responders how to stay safe after train accidents. Comstock testified that more training is important, but so is more gear. He said most fire stations in the area are lucky if they can supply each member of their crew with a single set of turnout gear: the protective coat, pants, boots, gloves and helmets firefighters wear.  “When I have to wash that, I’m out of service,” he said. “In response to the derailment, I had three firefighters who were exposed. Their gear is contaminated. I can’t use it.” It takes six months to order replacement gear, he said. “That means I have three firefighters who are out of service for six months who can’t respond to auto accidents or structure fires,” he said. Even then, that basic gear isn’t designed to stand up to hazardous materials like the chemicals on the Norfolk Southern train. For that kind of incident, firefighters need hazmat suits, which can cost $15,000 each, Comstock testified, along with specialized monitoring equipment. “It’s unrealistic for the federal government to provide that to every department, but we do need to look at a regional approach so we can call in those teams that can supplement what we’re trying to do,” he said.  Comstock said he hopes the committee will consider the needs of firefighters as it drafts legislation to right the wrongs of the East Palestine incident. “This incident has emphasized the need to better train and equip firefighters to respond to hazardous material incidents, specifically to derailments in rural areas, which are mostly served by volunteer fire departments that often lack sufficient resources, tax base and manpower,” he said.

The National Weather Service has issued a tornado emergency – the highest level of tornado warning – for Rolling Fork and Anguilla in Mississippi. Rolling Fork is in western Mississippi, about 55 miles northwest of Jackson. “At 8:06 PM CDT, a confirmed large and destructive tornado was located over Rolling Fork, moving northeast at 50 mph,” the NWS warning said. The NWS later added that “a confirmed tornado caused damage in Silver City and Rolling Fork.” The greatest risk of strong tornadoes includes more than six million people for places like Shreveport, Louisiana; Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Jackson, Mississippi. “All those in the ArkLaTex would be advised to be prepared to receive warnings and have a shelter plan in place, with increased urgency directed towards locations with closer proximity to the Mississippi River Valley,” the weather service office in Shreveport warned. A tornado watch has been issued for northern Alabama and middle Tennessee and is in effect until 3 a.m. CDT, according to the Storm Prediction Center.  The watch covers more than three million people and includes Nashville, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama. Thunderstorms moving into the tornado watch area have the potential to produce tornadoes, large hail and wind gusts up to 75 mph. “A few strong [to] intense tornadoes will be possible in this corridor with any persistent supercells later this evening,” the Storm Prediction Center said. This is in addition to a tornado watch issued by the prediction center that includes east Texas, southeast Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas and northwest Louisiana. “Storms are expected to intensify near and ahead of a cold front across the ArkLaTex region, with additional and somewhat more isolated storms possible by late afternoon,” the prediction center said. The watch is in effect for over 2 million people until late Friday evening and is expected to produce hail up to 2 inches in diameter and wind gusts up to 65 mph. “Overall severe potential including tornado risk is expected to increase as storms progress east-northeastward through late afternoon/early evening,” the SPC added. While the most intense storms will occur during the evening hours, any storm through the day could launch a few weak tornadoes. A tornado warning west of Dallas, led to a ground stop at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport early Friday morning. The National Weather Service says two separate EF-1 tornadoes struck Parker County, Texas, Friday morning. There was damage in the town of Poolville, including the destruction of the Poolville Tabernacle, a pavilion that is more than 100 years old, according to officials. The storm also flipped over mobile homes in Poolville, but no serious injuries were reported, according to CNN affiliate KTVT. “I ran down the hallway, but before I could get three feet, the whole house jerked to the side,” resident Eric Huntley told KTVT. “I balled up and I started hitting everywhere like a ping-pong ball.” Get the latest forecast for your area here Along with the tornado threat, there will be torrential rainfall that could lead to flash flooding.  The rain is expected across a large swath of the US stretching from Oklahoma to West Virginia. Nearly 19 million people are under flood watches across at least eight states in the mid-South and central regions.  “A dangerous, flash-flooding and severe weather event is expected tomorrow (Friday), as heavy rainfall focuses along a slow-moving cold front across the Ohio Valley, while tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail develop south of the boundary in the Lower MS Valley and Mid-South,” the Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday afternoon. The storm’s worst impacts were over the Oklahoma-Missouri border late Thursday, drenching parts of the states with 1 to 3 inches of rain in areas where a flash flood warning is in effect. Those same areas can expect another 1 to 3 inches of rain overnight. In addition to the heavy rain, large hail is also a primary threat along with damaging winds and the possibility of tornadoes.  Flood watches extend for more than 1,000 miles from Oklahoma and northern Arkansas eastward to southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern and central Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. A flood watch means conditions are favorable for possible flooding, and it’s not a strong indication flooding will occur, the National Weather Service explained. The significant flood threat is expected to shift from northwestern Arkansas to western Ohio throughout the day Friday. Storm totals between 2 and 4 inches of rain are expected, with the heaviest rainfall potentially exceeding 5 inches in total.

Monitoring equipment determined earlier this week that a small amount of the leaking water has begun reaching groundwater at the site, the operator said, which comes a few months after about 400,000 gallons were released in an initial leak. “While the leak continues to pose no risk to the public or the environment, we determined the best course of action is to power down the plant and perform the permanent repairs immediately,” said Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. The shutdown is not expected to impact electrical service in the area, the company said.  The earlier radioactive compound leak was confirmed and reported to state and federal officials in late November 2022, according to a mid-March news release from the operator. The leak was “fully contained on-site,” the release said. That initial leak consisted of about 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Tritium is a chemical compound that emits low levels of radiation and breaks down more quickly than many other radioactive materials. On Thursday, Xcel Energy notified the state Pollution Control Agency of a new water leak near the same spot of the previous leak, which the agency said is a much smaller amount in the hundreds of gallons. “State agencies have no evidence at this point to indicate a current or imminent risk to the public and will continue to monitor groundwater samples. Should an imminent risk arise, we will inform the public promptly,” the state agency said. The plant’s shutdown comes about three months after Xcel Energy submitted an application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew its operating license for the Monticello facility. Valerie Myers, a senior health physicist with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and part of the federal team tasked with monitoring the cleanup, attended a public hearing held for residents to speak on the license renewal, CNN affiliate WCCO reported Wednesday. Myers explained that there is three times as much tritium in a hallway exit sign than in the water under the Xcel Energy nuclear power plant, the outlet reported.  “If we look at the dose impact of something like this, it would be a fraction of a milligram. I’m talking 0.00-something milligrams. The average person will get 300 milligram in a year just from the sun, the ground, everything,” Myers told WCCO. However, Myers indicated that the groundwater is being monitored due to the plant’s proximity to the Mississippi River. “There are wells between the ones that are showing elevated tritium, and the Mississippi that are not showing any elevated levels. We are watching that because the ground flow is toward the Mississippi,” Myers said. Tritium occurs naturally in the environment at extremely low concentrations, and people are generally exposed to it daily in small amounts, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. It can enter the body when people swallow water containing the isotope, “inhale tritium as a gas in the air, or absorb it through their skin,” the agency states in an online explainer.

That statement, she said, “is illegal and contaminated by a conflict of interest.” The move raises the stakes even further in a national controversy that has sent tens of thousands of demonstrators onto Israel’s streets, caused military reservists to refuse to train, and prompted criticism from business and financial leaders, former military and intelligence commanders, and international allies including US President Joe Biden.  It comes after the Netanyahu government pushed through a law on Thursday effectively stripping the courts of the power to declare a prime minister unfit for office. Hours later, Netanyahu said in a speech to the nation that he would get personally involved in the controversial package of measures to overhaul the country’s judicial system. Until then, the campaign had been publicly led by Netanyahu allies including Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Simcha Rothman, the chair of the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee. “Until today my hands were tied. No more. I enter the event, for the sake of the people and the country, I will do everything in my power to reach a solution and calm the spirits in the nation,” Netanyahu said in his speech Thursday night. Baharav-Miara’s letter referred to a court-mandated conflict of interest agreement that Netanyahu accepted in order to allow him to form a government despite being on trial for multiple allegations of corruption. “As a Prime Minister indicted with crimes, you must refrain from actions that arouse a reasonable fear of a conflict of interest  between your personal interests in the criminal proceedings and your role as Prime Minister,” she wrote to him. A source close to Netanyahu, who was in London meeting UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday, denied he had broken the law or violated his conflict of interest agreement. “The Prime Minister’s announcement yesterday has no bearing on his personal affairs,” the source said. The dispute is likely to end up in the high court.

The expansion bill, which also includes benefits to the state’s hospitals, received final legislative approval on Thursday. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat who has fought to broaden Medicaid for years, said he will sign the bill soon. “Medicaid expansion is a once-in-a-generation investment that will make all North Carolina families healthier, while strengthening our economy,” Cooper said in a statement. Roughly 600,000 North Carolina residents may become eligible for Medicaid coverage. Some 15.2% of state residents between the ages of 19 and 64 were uninsured in 2021, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation review of Census Bureau data. One of the largest states that has yet to expand, North Carolina is also the first state since 2018 to broaden Medicaid through the legislative process. Since 2017, voters have approved expansion at the ballot box in seven GOP-led states, most recently South Dakota last year. The final vote in North Carolina’s House took place on the 13th anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which created Medicaid expansion. Multiple factors prompted Republican state lawmakers to approve the measure this year, including an extra federal incentive to expand, the precarious financial condition of many rural hospitals, the increased certainty that Obamacare would not be repealed and the coming unwinding of a Covid-19 pandemic Medicaid provision that will result in millions losing coverage nationwide. Also, the Covid-19 pandemic heightened awareness of the need for health insurance. “The economic and the health benefits (of Medicaid expansion) are undeniable,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, noting that cancer is the leading cause of death in the state. “But I do believe that Covid played a role. There’s a recognition that people need health care that they can rely on.” Those covered through Medicaid expansion are more likely to see doctors and get care for chronic conditions and less likely to screen positive for depression, said Sarah Lueck, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Expansion is linked to fewer premature deaths among older folks, more early-stage cancer diagnoses and lower maternal and infant mortality rates. It also helps reduce enrollees’ medical debt. In addition, expansion is important in improving health equity since the majority of people who fall into the coverage gap in non-expansion states are people of color, Lueck said. North Carolina’s hospitals, many of which are struggling financially, would also benefit from expansion. “This landmark legislation will have lasting benefits for our state by helping hardworking North Carolina families, stabilizing rural health providers, and improving the overall health of our communities,” said Steve Lawler, CEO of the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which advocated for the bill. The state would not have to shell out anything from its general fund for Medicaid expansion. The bulk of the cost for the newly eligible enrollees would be covered by the federal government, which provides a 90% matching rate. That’s expected to equate to least $5 billion annually, depending on enrollment. Hospitals would foot most of the state’s share of the bill – estimated at $500 million to $600 million a year – through higher provider taxes. In return, the legislature approved the state participating in a federal program that would provide additional federal funds to cover more of the cost of Medicaid beneficiaries’ care. That extra money, estimated at $2.5 billion for the current year, would go to hospitals. The state would also benefit from an American Rescue Plan provision that sends additional federal funding to states that expand Medicaid within a certain time frame. That measure would provide the state with about $1.6 billion over two years. In addition, the legislature loosened the state’s certificate of need requirements, which would make it easier for health care providers to add facilities and services for drug treatment and psychiatric care, open ambulatory surgical centers and purchase MRI machines.

A report from the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the drone, called the “Unmanned Underwater Nuclear Attack Craft ‘Haeil,’” was tested from March 21 to 23, cruising in waters off the country’s east coast for more than 59 hours before its test warhead was detonated on Thursday afternoon. “The mission of the underwater nuclear strategic weapon is to stealthily infiltrate into operational waters and make a super-scale radioactive tsunami through underwater explosion to destroy naval striker groups and major operational ports of the enemy,” the KCNA report said. The KCNA report said the weapon has been in development since 2012 and has undergone more than 50 tests in the past two years. This week’s test “verified its reliability and safety and fully confirmed its lethal strike capability,” the KCNA report said, adding the drone can be deployed from any port or towed by a surface ship to begin its operations. Analysts poured doubt on North Korea’s claims, noting that North Korea has previously exaggerated its capabilities and deployment time lines. “Pyongyang’s latest claim to have a nuclear-capable underwater drone should be met with skepticism” because North Korea offered no proof, said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. In March 2022, North Korea released footage of what it claimed was a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that was later discredited by experts. Writing on social media Friday, Ankit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “I tend to take North Korea seriously, but can’t rule out the possibility that this is an attempt at deception.” He added that it would be “ill-advised” to allocate limited fissile material for a warhead in an underwater drone, as opposed to a more “road-mobile” ballistic missiles.  But the idea of an unmanned submersible carrying a nuclear warhead is not unique to North Korea. Russia claims to have developed the Poseidon torpedo, a submarine-launched, nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions. Its nuclear propulsion system would give the Poseidon virtually limitless range. But Russia has offered no proof of a successful test of the Poseidon and analysts suspect it could be years from deployment. North Korea’s purported new underwater weapon has important differences from the Poseidon. It is conventionally powered and is not launched from a sub, meaning it would not be on a par with the Russian torpedo, the analysts said. North Korea’s drone test claim comes at the same time Pyongyang said it tested nuclear-capable cruise missiles this week. Four of the subsonic missiles hit targets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, after flying oval and figure-8 patterns of 1,500 and 1,800 kilometers (932 and 1,118 miles) on Wednesday, KCNA reported. Wednesday’s drill “let strategic cruise missile units get familiar with the procedures and processes for carrying out the tactical nuclear attack missions,” the report said. The state-run Rodong Sinmun released a series of photos on its website purportedly showing the cruise missiles and the underwater drone. The KCNA report said Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons development was necessary to counter “the reckless military provocations being escalated by the U.S. and the South Korean authorities.” US and South Korean forces have been holding their biggest war games in five years on the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has been testing various missiles at the same time, including the test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week and the tests of smaller range missiles like the cruise missiles tested on Wednesday. Analysts say Pyongyang is delivering a message to the US and its allies in the region. “North Korea’s ICBM tests are thinly veiled threats that it could potentially destroy American cities,” Easley said. “Its recent short-range missile firings attempt to increase the credibility, command, and control of its self-proclaimed tactical nuclear weapons units aimed at South Korea and Japan.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[9,7,11],"topic_weights":[52,42,5],"title":"NWSL players unhappy over FIFA video gam","text":["Several National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) players expressed their discontent at the accuracy of their likenesses on Electronic Arts’ (EA) FIFA video game franchise. EA, the NWSL and the league’s players union (NWSLPA) announced a partnership earlier in March making the stars and teams of the league playable in the 2023 edition of the popular video game. The league made its first official appearance in FIFA 23 on Wednesday. Sydney Leroux, Jess Fishlock, Janine Beckie and Madison Hammond were among the players who shared messages on social media expressing unhappiness over their in-game appearances in FIFA 23. Leroux wrote on Twitter: “I know you expect women to just be thankful and grateful that you’ve given us a little sliver of publicity but please stop wasting our time. Some of us are bald.” Leroux also shared a picture of her appearance from FIFA 16 compared to the current version, noting the older edition of the game had a closer likeness. Alongside two images of her in-game player wearing an Angel City jersey, Hammond said, “Somebody please lmk when they find me, Madison Hammond #99 from Angel City! Because this … is simply not it!” Beckie posted a photo of her in-game player alongside an image of her playing in real life, writing, “Found my long lost twin! Fraternal obviously.” Players also had issues with their attribute valuations in the game, accusing the makers of not having watched the league. “When @EASPORTSFIFA didn’t put me in the top 10 for speed I was mad but I was like eh we will show them,” wrote Sarah Gorden, a defender for Angel City. “But when they gave me a 48 rating in speed I realized they have never and will never actually watch a NWSL game.” CNN reached out to EA and the NWSL for comment. Meghann Burke, Executive Director of the NWSLPA, told CNN in a statement, “We insist on immediate action from EA to rectify the offensive and inauthentic portrayals of players of color in FIFA 23, which were released yesterday. The NWSL Players Association, alongside our agent OneTeam Partners, has a dedicated gaming team actively working with EA to resolve this matter.” When the partnership was announced, Burke stated, “Today is a historic day for both our players and fans.” NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman added: “The NWSL’s integration into EA SPORTS FIFA 23 is a monumental milestone for the league, the players and millions of football fans around the world as we continue pushing boundaries for the women’s game.” The 11th season of the NWSL is due to kick off on Saturday, with the North Carolina Courage hosting Kansas City in the opening fixture.

It suggests to me a deplorable lack of social supports that could allow aged people to enjoy a dignified retirement.  While it’s true that some people choose to work past retirement, most of us in this country, at some point or the other, have seen elderly people hard at work in occupations that people many years younger would find taxing.  And yet, many Americans somehow seem to be puzzled by the recent protests over retirement benefits that are roiling the country of my birth.  For the past three months, a spasm of demonstrations has gripped France over moves by the government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.  In recent days, French indignation led to a no-confidence vote that President Emmanuel Macron only narrowly survived. A new round of mass protests called by organized labor took place on Thursday — the ninth day of strikes since the bill was introduced in January.  Schools are closed because teachers are on strike. Transportation, including France’s usually reliable train service, is suddenly erratic because of the work stoppages. On top of all this, Parisians have seen their city’s streets strewn with tons of trash, after sanitation workers launched a labor action in solidarity.  I return to France for several weeks each year, but have lived in the United States some 30 years and know both countries well. One thing that seems clear to me is that the kind of upheaval playing out in the country of my birth would be almost unthinkable in America. Americans seem not to be able to understand the source of the boiling national rage felt by the French over the planned increase in the retirement age.  The closest analogy in the United States to anything like what my compatriots are experiencing would be the decision four decades ago to raise the age at which Social Security benefits are doled out.  And that’s exactly what happened: The US government announced in 1983 that it would gradually raise the age for collecting full Social Security retirement benefits from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period, beginning in 2000. Of course, older Americans care deeply about Social Security — and often cast their votes accordingly. Still, it’s hard to imagine such a change going over quite so easily in France.  For the most part, the demonstrations in France haven’t awakened Americans’ sense of empathy or solidarity. Instead, it has elicited expressions of sheer befuddlement. What on earth, my friends and acquaintances here ask, do the French have to complain about?  Life in France is not perfect. But French citizens have a generous health care system, which means workers pay next-to-nothing out of pocket for medical care. University education is nearly free. Unemployment benefits allow laid-off workers to sustain a reasonable quality of life while they look for their next jobs.  Yes, French workers have all of that. It is, in short, part of their birthright as citizens of France.  After World War II, both the retirement system and the National Health care system were introduced in France, and though there have been limitations over the last twenty years, social benefits still make it among the most envied countries in Europe in terms of its social programs.  If Americans are baffled by the French willingness to fight to hold onto these hard-won benefits, it is in part because the two countries have very different ideas about what it means to be a worker. In the United States, work is an identity. You are what you do.  For those of us raised in French culture, work refers to a finite period of life lasting roughly 40 years. And when that work is done, you are still young enough and fit enough to enjoy the best of what life has to offer. It’s the norm that retirement years — or decades actually — are spent traveling, caring for grandchildren or picking up new hobbies.  It’s part of our social compact: The French work hard during their most productive years during which time they pay what most Americans would consider usuriously high taxes. But then comes the much anticipated “Troisieme Age” — the “third age.” It’s a concept French people grow up with and cling to fervently for their entire lives.  The “first age” is childhood. During life’s “second age,” many of us are saddled with responsibilities of work and raising children. The third age however promises a good, healthy retirement free from want and worry — the kind of retirement many in the United States cannot even dream of. It is no wonder that people are willing to take to the streets to protect it.  The ongoing protests are also seen as a pushback against Macron’s imperious governing style. Years ago, he earned the nickname “Jupiter” — after the king of the Roman gods — as he was derided by some for his highhanded approach to governing — imposing his will, in the eyes of his critics, as if he were a sovereign rather than elected.  Macron says retirement reform is necessary because the system is near collapse. There’s some disagreement about that, however. The budget appears to be balanced for the next dozen years, although it’s true that falling birth rates and increasing longevity pose a problem that will have to be addressed.  Still, there are less draconian ways to fix problems posed by a future retirement fund shortfall. For starters, Macron might reverse his move to abolish the wealth tax. He might also reconsider corporate tax breaks that have benefited big business handsomely.  His administration’s use last week of a constitutional maneuver to bypass a vote in the National Assembly and raise the retirement age is an example of his imperial style. It’s an approach to governing that Macron has used multiple times, including when he passed a budget late last year. And as the protests wear on, there’s been another sign of government heavy-handedness: Macron now has resorted to the “requisition” of some striking workers — in short requiring them to return to their places of employment or risk losing their jobs.  Such moves are, in my view, an admission of political impotence rather than strength. The president has failed to see politics as the art of persuasion and is instead ruling by fiat. The brutal police crackdown on demonstrators protesting pension reforms led to hundreds of arrests in recent days, another sign that he lacks political deftness. The unions meanwhile show no sign of backing down, and are continuing to organize massive protests urging workers to stand firm and remain off the job.  So what’s next? Surely the French will continue to take to the streets, something they always do with great gusto. Beyond this, it’s hard to say how this upheaval ends.  There’s no question that the French are slow to embrace change. I am and will always remain staunchly French, although after many years in the US, I can see that my compatriots need to show greater flexibility. They hold on too long to obsolete aspects of their cherished way of life. It’s time for the French to abandon their  “c’est tout ou rien” (“all or nothing”) approach as we negotiate what French society will look like in the future.  But then I read about the latest moves to raise the US retirement age to 70, and think that my protesting countrymen have a thing or two that they can teach workers in America when it comes to protecting the sanctity of their golden years.

Over the past week, some commentators have appeared gobsmacked by the unprecedented nature of this turn of events for the twice-impeached former president. But really? The idea of prosecuting a former head of state is actually a fairly normal occurrence in the course of a functioning democracy — just not one that has transpired in this country. Since 2000, in over 75 countries around the world, according to Axios research, heads of state who left office have been prosecuted or jailed — including in vibrant and strong democracies like Israel, France and South Korea. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been defending himself against charges of fraud, breach of trust and taking bribes for nearly three years and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was released from prison in 2017 after serving two-thirds of a 27-month sentence for fraud. Back in 2021, France’s former President Nicolas Sarkozy was found guilty of illegal campaign financing and received a one-year jail sentence. And in that same year, former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison after serving nearly five years following a corruption conviction.  In 2019, then former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was released from prison after serving a year and a half of a 12-year corruption sentence — and went on to successfully win back the presidency in 2022. In fact, there are plenty of recent cases involving the prosecution and jailing of former Latin America leaders. Take Peru for example where all but one of its former presidents since 1985 has been arrested or charged with criminal offenses. Whether it’s former South African President Jacob Zuma or Taiwan’s former President Chen Shui-bian or Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Najib Razak — across the globe, former leaders are regularly prosecuted, convicted and given time behind bars for offenses stemming from corrupt business dealings, elections hijinks, or misdeeds that occurred while serving in office. Prosecuting a former leader for wrongdoing isn’t sand in the gears of democracy; it’s a feature that keeps in check future leaders and reassures a nation that no one person, no matter his or her rank and influence, is above the law nor immunized from accountability. America needs to take a deep breath and realize that if Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg ends up prosecuting Trump in the case relating to hush money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, it won’t be the end of the world. Nor will the sky begin falling if Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis ends up charging the former president with racketeering and conspiracy charges related to Trump’s attempt to overturn his 2020 loss in the state. Or if Special Counsel Jack Smith ends up prosecuting Trump for any number of alleged offenses he committed either during or after his time in office. We don’t know if Trump will be charged in any of these investigations but if he is, American democracy will not only be OK, it will be stronger as a result. America has already had its share of presidential public corruption scandals. From the imbroglio surrounding Ulysses Grant’s Whiskey Ring in the late 19th century to Warren Harding’s infamous Teapot Dome Scandal of the early 1920s to Richard Nixon’s role in Watergate and Ronald Reagan’s involvement in the Iran-Contra affair — US presidents have often found themselves in the crosshairs of the justice system, and in many cases their close aides ended up serving time in prison. In each of these cases, however, the president himself was spared prosecution, which ended up, over time, creating something of a mythos — entirely separate from the Constitution — that prosecuting or jailing a former president was overly divisive or unbecoming of the world’s most powerful nation. But now it’s time for Americans to make peace with the fact that for every remarkable president that we have been fortunate to have leading us through times of war and uncertainty, occasionally, like any other country on earth, we will get a bad apple in the White House. And using the powers of the justice system to hold these bad actors to account is not only called for — it will actually strengthen Americans’ belief in our justice system. And, as presaged in the opening line of our own Constitution, it will put our nation one step closer to becoming a more perfect union.

But former President Donald Trump isn’t most presidential candidates, and we’ve seen him thrive in politically challenging environments before.  Ever since Trump announced last week that he would be indicted in New York, where a grand jury has been hearing evidence about an alleged scheme to falsify records to conceal hush money payments to an adult-film star, we have been waiting to learn his legal fate. But it seems New York is not his only cause for concern. Trump’s legal troubles could be ramping up elsewhere, with an appeals court ruling that Trump’s defense attorney must testify before a grand jury investigating the handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago and Georgia prosecutors considering potential racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State. However, it’s worth remembering that the former president has already survived two impeachments, numerous investigations and countless controversies before. Given what he’s gone through, and how he’s established his political persona, an indictment that might end other political careers is not an inevitable body blow for Trump. In fact, numerous commentators, including Democratic officials, are rightly speculating that an indictment in the New York case could end up strengthening Trump’s hand going into 2024. Based on this perspective, it was not surprising that Trump himself announced (incorrectly) on Truth Social that he would be arrested on Tuesday, calling on his supporters to protest such a move. Privately, according to the New York Times, he has been considering how a “perp walk” might be perceived. And while Trump’s political brand has struggled in the past few months, recent polls show him leading the pack of potential Republican presidential candidates — with a significant gulf between him and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. So, why might Trump gain further strength if he is indicted? Trump’s legal troubles play directly into the ways he has packaged himself as a politician. For one, Trump thrives on media attention. This is his major weapon in political combat. He loves to dominate the news cycle, redirect national conversations, lash out at his enemies and eclipse all other issues. Trump, who has an instinctive feel for the rhythms of cable television and social media, did it again this week. As war rages in Ukraine and US officials try to contain a potential fallout in the banking sector, there’s been considerable coverage of his possible arrest after his Truth Social post this weekend. It doesn’t seem to matter that much of the attention is negative. As president, reality television star and real estate mogul, Trump has cast himself as a fighter who has warded off individuals and institutions that he claims are out to get him. This is an essential part of his political persona: the aggrieved public figure who is at perpetual war with the world around him. In a manner that would make President Richard Nixon supremely jealous, Trump knows how to weaponize attacks like nobody else, turning on his opposition and making the case to supporters that his adversaries are the ones who are abusing power. He used this strategy with former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (“Crooked Hillary”), the media (“fake news”), former FBI Director James Comey (“Slippery James Comey”) and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller (“rigged Mueller Witch Hunt”), to name a few examples. Trump went even bigger when he took aim at the entire election system after Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020. Most recently, he called Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a “woke tyrant.” Trump uses this to connect with Republican voters, many of whom are White men in rural areas who feel as if the world has left them behind. This allows Trump — a man of wealth, power and privilege — to paint himself as being “anti-establishment,” a message that continues to resonate in a post-Watergate America. As a result, Trump relates to his supporters, making the case that he is fighting against the forces they are up against as well. It appears Trump’s strategy is still effective, as Republicans have rallied to his defense in a Pavlovian fashion. The airwaves this past week have been filled with Republicans playing their familiar roles. It only took a few days after Trump’s social media announcement for Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to further weaponize the House Judiciary Committee by calling for an investigation into Bragg. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, seemingly unable to separate himself from Trump, accused Bragg of unfair treatment, saying, “Lawyer after lawyer will tell you this is the weakest case out there, trying to make a misdemeanor a felony.” And then there is a part of Trump that has always loved the tough-guy, mob boss image. Professional wrestling fans will remember the gusto with which he embraced the fighting spectacle and the connections he forged to the world of professional boxing. As someone who rose to prominence in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, he is not deterred by the idea that many Americans are more likely to see him as a character out of “The Godfather” or “Goodfellas” than someone who belongs in the West Wing. As I wrote in 2016, this suits the cultural era of the anti-hero and allows Trump to revel in the tough bravado that comes with that role. And shortly after he entered the Oval Office, he surrounded himself with military officials who bolstered his image as a man of strength. To top it all off, Trump, who does not seem to feel any sense of shame, appears to have insulated himself from the psychological pressure that others might feel to step down in the face of controversy and scandal. Put all of this together and it becomes easier to understand why an indictment might not be the worst thing to happen to the former president. It must also be said that an alleged relationship with a porn star, which Trump denies having, may no longer be an automatically disqualifying issue the way that it used to be. It’s also worth noting that this allegation about his personal life seems to pale in comparison to the full-throated campaign to reverse the will of the electorate and undermine our democratic system in 2020. Whether or not someone benefits from an investigation or indictment should have no bearing on those who work on behalf of the law and the Constitution. And regardless of the outcome of the many investigations, they are — contrary to what Trump may claim — worthy pursuits of justice. Ultimately, voters can still respond how they like in 2024, since an indictment or conviction would not bar Trump from becoming president again. While there are many factors that will determine whether we can reestablish the many guardrails that have disappeared in American politics, the electorate will be of utmost importance when it comes time to decide who should be given the responsibility of inhabiting the Oval Office. On Election Day in 2020, Americans proved that Trump could be defeated. If an indictment, or several indictments, come down in the next few months, voters — not courts and not prosecutors — will once again be the ultimate judges of his political fate.

Musk in particular has been known for April 1 trolling, including in 2018 when he falsely tweeted that his electric vehicle company Tesla\n            \n                (TSLA) had gone bankrupt. “To keep your blue checkmark on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue,”  the company’s tweet continued. Twitter Blue is a subscription service that Musk relaunched late last year that costs individuals $84 a year or $8 a month. Charging fees provides a revenue stream for Twitter — and a needed one, as Twitter currently collects virtually all of its revenue from advertisers, who have been fleeing the social media platform since he took over. Charging for Twitter verification provides both additional revenue to Twitter and a way for Musk to show his disdain for government agencies, journalists and others. Yet building a replacement for the legacy verification program has proved to be fraught. Twitter Blue first launched in the pre-Musk days of 2021, as a subscription service offering “power features” like undoing a tweet and saving bookmarks to folders. Musk relaunched the program in November 2022, including a blue checkmark in the features for paying users. Immediately the program was flooded with users who paid for counterfeit accounts pretending to be users such as former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, LeBron James and Nintendo. Before being suspended, the impostor Nintendo account tweeted an image of video game character Mario giving the viewer the middle finger. The LeBron James account falsely claimed the athlete had requested a trade. The fake Trump account tweeted, “This is why Elon Musk’s plan doesn’t work.”  Musk pulled the Twitter Blue program for a few weeks and relaunched it yet again in December, with additional steps for reviewing and approving subscribers. Beyond the checkmark, Blue also lets paying users edit a tweet up to 5 times within 30 minutes, create tweets up to 4,000 characters long and post HD videos. The company also says Twitter Blue users will see 50% fewer ads in their home timelines, and that their tweets will be prioritized among replies, mentions and searches. For companies and other organizations, Twitter Blue costs $1,000 a month for the main account and $50 a month for each additional related account. – CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.

Two of the three teenagers shot are in critical condition in the hospital, police said. Video released by authorities shows four masked suspects firing what police described as more than 60 rounds using “rifles and semi-automatic pistols” in the city’s Carroll Park neighborhood. “You see an automatic gun going off in broad daylight on the streets of the City of Philadelphia, four males just shooting up the block, shooting with no care in the world it seems to me,” Philadelphia Police Captain James Kearney said at a news conference. The four suspects got out of a newer model Honda CR-V, pulled out their guns and started shooting in what police believe was a targeted attack, authorities said. Police are also looking for the driver of the car.  Two of the victims, a 13-year-old and a 16-year-old, were taken to hospital and are in “critical and extremely critical” conditions, police said. “They’re struggling for their lives right now,” Kearney said. The third victim, another 13-year-old, is in stable condition, according to police. Kearney described their injuries as “severe.” A handgun used in the shooting has been recovered, but the serial number has been “obliterated,” police added.  The motive of the shooting is not clear, police said, but they are investigating it as gang-related. “It’s very concerning, it’s disappointing and these people need to be held accountable,” Kearney said.

The 14.6-inch-wide artwork is now the most expensive piece by Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai ever to go under the hammer, the auction house said. Created in the early 1830s, the “Great Wave” depicts three fishing boats battling raging seas in what is today Japan’s Chiba Prefecture. It is part of a genre known as “Ukiyo-e” that saw artists mass-produce works on paper using woodblock printing.  Experts are uncertain of how many copies of the “Great Wave” were initially produced, though there would have once been several thousand of them. The prints were not always as sought-after as they are today, however, and only a fraction are thought to have survived. Blogging for the British Museum, which owns three original copies of the “Great Wave,” researcher Capucine Korenberg wrote in 2020 that printmakers “would have produced prints until the woodblocks literally wore out,” adding that this may mean as many as 8,000 were made. However, Korenberg said she had only been able to find photographic evidence of 111 different versions. Korenberg added that prints of the “Great Wave” were inexpensive at the time, and would once have cost the same “as about two helpings of noodles in the mid-19th century.” Part of Hokusai’s famous “Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji” series, the “Great Wave” is now among the world’s most widely reproduced images, appearing on posters, mugs, shirts and fridge magnets. Other copies auctioned by Christie’s in recent years have ranged in price from a few hundred thousand dollars to over $1.5 million. The one sold on Tuesday is described in the auction house’s catalog as a “well-preserved” early print that ranks “beyond doubt among the 20 or so best impressions surviving today,” though Christie’s had initial estimated bids between $500,000 and $700,000. Listed under its full name “Kanagawa oki nami ura (Under the well of the Great Wave off Kanagawa),” the item was acquired by the previous owner’s family in the early 1900s and was once exhibited at the Glyptotek art museum in Copenhagen. The record sale was part of a major auction of Japanese and Korean art that saw almost 200 artworks and antiquities fetch a combined $11.4 million. The “Great Wave” print was among more than 10 works attributed to Hokusai that appeared in the sale. Also among them were prints depicting a waterwheel and a snowy landscape, both from his “Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji” series, that sold for $37,800 and just over $30,000, respectively. The biggest sale of the day, however, was achieved by an 18th-century Korean “moon jar” — a white porcelain vessel made by joining two hemispherical halves — that sold for over $4.5 million.

An IAF representative told an Indian parliamentary committee that due to the Ukraine war a “major delivery” from Moscow “is not going to take place.” The admission, published in a report by India’s lower house of parliament on Tuesday, is the first official confirmation by Indian authorities amid swirling rumors and reports in local media suggesting shortcomings in Russian capacity. “They have given us in writing that they are not able to deliver it,” the representative said, according to the report. CNN has contacted the Russian Embassy in New Delhi but did not receive a response at the time of publishing. The report did not mention the specifics of the delivery. The biggest ongoing delivery is the S-400 Triumf air defense system units India bought in 2018 for $5.4 billion. Three of these systems have been delivered and two more are awaited, Reuters reported. IAF also depends on Russia for spares for its Su-30MKI and MiG-29 fighter jets, the mainstay of the service branch, according to Reuters. Russia is the world’s second-largest arms exporter, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a large-scale effort to build up capacity to produce more weapons for the war in a move he said was “urgently needed.” Putin’s order also followed repeated complaints by Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin that his mercenaries were not receiving sufficient munitions in their prolonged battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut. New Delhi has strong ties with Moscow dating back to the Cold War, and remains heavily dependent on the Kremlin for its military equipment – a vital link given the ongoing tensions along India’s shared Himalayan border with an increasingly assertive China. The admission by the IAF is “very serious,” according to Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation. “I think it underscores the problems that (India) has been bedeviling this relationship for quite some time,” he added. “And the Ukraine crisis has accelerated the trend that India, for a very long time, has been trying to diversify, and was concerned about its over dependence on Russia.” A SIPRI report published this month said Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier, despite a drop in defense imports from 62% to 45% between 2017 and 2022. Experts have suggested the drop could be because India is looking to diversify its imports and push more home-grown equipment. Last September, a US State Department official said Washington was in “deep” talks with India over its reliance on Russian arms and energy. Russia “is no longer a reliable weapons supplier” and Indian representatives are “coming to understand that there could be real benefits for them (in finding other markets),” the official told reporters in New York. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, India, the world’s largest democracy, has carefully navigated a middle path. New Delhi has refused to condemn Moscow’s brutal assault in various United Nations resolutions. And rather than cutting economic ties with the Kremlin, India has undermined Western sanctions by increasing its purchases of Russian oil, coal and fertilizer. India has also maintained close ties to the West – particularly the United States – as it works to thwart China’s rise. As Putin continues his aggression, driving food and fuel prices to soar, experts have suggested Moscow’s actions in Ukraine could be testing New Delhi’s patience. And the Indian Air Force going public about Russia’s arms delivery failure could be a sign of that strain, said Pant, from the Observer Research Foundation. “I think the relationship (between India and Russia) has been under stress for a long time,” he said. “It’s now becoming clear that the present trajectory of this relationship is becoming increasingly unsustainable (because of) what is happening in Ukraine.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[13,3],"topic_weights":[96,3],"title":"Sen. Lindsey Graham ‘admonished’ by Sena","text":["The Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded Sen. Lindsey Graham Thursday for soliciting campaign contributions five times during a media interview in a Capitol office building in violation of Senate rules. The bipartisan committee sent a public letter admonishing the South Carolina Republican for soliciting donations to Herschel Walker’s campaign in the Russell Senate office building during a November 30, 2022, interview with Fox News. It is against Senate rules to solicit campaign donations in federal buildings. “The public must feel confident that Members use public resources only for official actions in the best interests of the United States, not for partisan political activity. Your actions failed to uphold that standard, resulting in harm to the public trust and confidence in the United States Senate,” Chair Chris Coons, a Democrat, and Vice Chair James Lankford, a Republican, wrote in the letter. “You are hereby admonished.” An admonishment by the panel amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist. But the secretive committee exists to police and punish members who break the rules, which can include a public rebuke like the one Graham received on Thursday. In a statement, Graham said that “it was a mistake.” “I take responsibility. I will try to do better in the future,” he said. A Graham aide said the senator had completed almost a dozen similar interviews in the prior weeks “on the same matter from Washington, South Carolina, and Georgia.” The aide said Graham “simply did not remain sufficiently cognizant of the location from which this particular interview was being conducted. All previous interviews had been conducted ‘off-site’ and not on federal property.” Graham contacted the two leaders of the Senate Ethics Committee after the interview to notify them of what occurred and to express regrets, the aide noted. The letter also acknowledged that Graham self-reported the violation. The public admonishment came after the senator similarly violated Senate standards in October 2020, the letter noted. While Graham solicited funds for his own campaign during a media interview in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, the Ethics Committee found his behavior at the time to be “inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature.” Republican senators, including Graham, in 2022 united behind Walker’s high-stakes race to unseat Georgia’s Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock to help decide the balance of the Senate. Walker fell short in a December runoff, cementing the Democrats’ 51-49 majority.

The Florida Atlantic Owls (FAU) upset No. 4-seeded Tennessee, 62-55; Markquis Nowell made NCAA history as the Kansas State Wildcats edged out the Michigan State Spartans in overtime to win 98-93; Gonzaga shocked UCLA with a late three to seal a dramatic 79-76 win; while UConn comfortably beat Arkansas 88-65 to advance to the Elite Eight. Before the game, FAU head coach Dusty May said his team would “embrace” their Cinderella tag, but the 46-year-old also maintained his team had the quality to progress regardless of their seeding. May said: “We’re very, very confident in our abilities and those guys in the locker room.” The coach was right to have this belief in his players as the No. 9-seeded Owls knocked out the No. 4-seeded Volunteers to advance to the Elite Eight. In a scrappy, low-scoring contest FAU had a huge second-half surge to claim the incredible 62-55 upset. The underdogs were trailing 27-22 after the first half at the famed Madison Square Garden in New York City but outscored the Volunteers 40-28 – including an 18-2 run – in the second half to seal the victory. “Y’all can’t count us out no more man. We’re here to stay and we’re going to keep fighting no matter who we line up against, who we play,” said FAU guard Nick Boyd in the postgame press conference. “I got a group of brothers that play together and I feel like there’s nobody in the country that loves each other like we do and works like [we do] so we’re going to keep making statements.” Nowell makes NCAA history as Wildcats edge Spartans The opening game in the Sweet 16 of the men’s NCAA tournament resulted in a thrilling 98-93 Kansas State overtime victory over Michigan State on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The game was dominated by a record-setting performance from Kansas State star Markquis Nowell. The guard, playing in his hometown, stuffed the stat sheet and finished with 20 points, an incredible 19 assists – a new NCAA tournament single game record – and five steals to carry the Wildcats to victory. Nowell, who played the second half with an injured right ankle, is the first player to finish with 20+ points, 19+ assists and 5+ steals in a men’s Division I or NBA game since 1996, according to CBS Sports. “All glory to god, man he gave me these gifts and these talents and I’m just glad that I get the platform to showcase them, and I have a ton of faith,” Nowell said after the victory. Nowell’s standout performance drew the attention of some of the sport’s biggest names with Lakers legend Earvin ‘Magic’ Johnson and Kevin Durant singing his praises.  Bulldogs nip Bruins with late triple Gonzaga and UCLA have given college hoops fans some incredible matchups in recent years and their latest encounter was no different. With two minutes and 30 seconds left in the game, the Bulldogs had a 72-62 lead thanks to an incredible second-half display. Yet, the Bruins continued to fight and battled back to take a 76-75 lead with 13 seconds left, thanks to a three pointer by Amari Bailey. Then with under 10 seconds on the clock, up stepped Julian Strawther. The 20-year-old guard won the game with a clutch three from the edge of the halfcourt logo, reminiscent of then-Bulldog Jalen Suggs’ game winner in 2021. “It’s moments like that you can’t make up,” Strawther said on the game-winner in the postgame press conference. “Those are literally the moments you dream of, to even make a shot like that in March Madness.” Huskies cruise past Razorbacks into Elite Eight Elsewhere, the Connecticut Huskies comfortably dispatched of the Arkansas Razorbacks with a routine 88-65 victory. UConn were led by Jordan Hawkins’ 24 points as they held off the Razorbacks to make it to the Elite Eight. In the Elite Eight, Kansas State will face FAU and Gonzaga will play UConn on March 25.

A congressional hearing focusing on the popular TikTok video app on Thursday became the latest in a series of recent clarifying moments that laid bare not just the bipartisan hostility in Washington to Beijing’s new global heft but also the extent to which the growing superpower confrontation is beginning to be felt in multiple corners of American life. A five-hour grilling of TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew also underscored how China is being increasingly viewed not just as a rising threat to US security and economic dominance but also as an ideological challenge – one antithetical to America’s values and way of life, much as the Soviet Union was in the last century. The possibility that the Chinese-owned platform, which says it has 150 million US monthly users, could be used by the Chinese Communist Party to gather intelligence on millions of Americans was brought up repeatedly by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Members were also preoccupied with the possibility that young, developing American minds could be shaped by a torrent of Chinese-made content or information that could suppress US principles of political freedom and human rights or create confusion or false narratives about American foreign policy. Such arguments were encapsulated by Washington state GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee and set the tone for the hearing. “We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values – values for freedom, human rights, and innovation,” Rodgers told Chew. “TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation.” “Your platform should be banned.” But Rodgers was not the only government figure who expressed deep suspicion of TikTok on Thursday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken fueled speculation that time may be running out for the app, which is beloved by millions of American teenagers but is already prohibited on federal government phones and on other official devices elsewhere in the West.  Blinken said that he believed TikTok was a national security risk and should be “ended one way or another,” while adding, “there are different ways of doing that.” And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy backed legislation to effectively ban TikTok in the US. “I don’t know that we have to give the president the authority. I think maybe we may be able to do it ourselves and I’ll let it work in the House,” the California Republican told CNN’s Manu Raju. The hearing was the latest in a recent sequence of events that have made the long predicted clash between the existing superpower, the United States, and the rising one, China, a tangible reality for millions of Americans. They include the drama over a Chinese spy balloon that floated across US skies in February before being shot down by US jets. And just this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to Moscow to offer legitimacy to Russian President Vladimir Putin after he was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Xi left no doubt that his purpose is to challenge the US-led international system that has been in place since the end of World War II, saying that China was ready to “stand guard over the world order.” Chew’s mission on Capitol Hill on Thursday was to convince lawmakers that TikTok is independent of Chinese government control and to show how the company has tried to demonstrate it is protecting the data of American users through an initiative using US servers known as Project Texas. That he failed so clearly to do so was largely because most of the lawmakers seemed to have made up their minds on the issue long ago. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher, the chair of the new House select committee on China, said on “CNN Primetime” on Thursday that the key issue was not where the data of US users was stored, arguing that the core problem was that TikTok’s Chinese parent company controlled the app’s algorithm and was susceptible to pressure from the Chinese government. “They can use this app for spreading disinformation, influencing what news Americans see, influencing future elections,” Gallagher said.  The government in Beijing did Chew no favors. Its commerce ministry said hours before the hearing that it would firmly oppose any US attempt to force TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app to an American firm, warning that such a move would raise questions about the viability of Chinese and other foreign companies investing in the US economy. The statement only reinforced the belief of many American lawmakers that TikTok is far from independent and underscored their doubts about Chew’s claims that its data collection practices are similar to those used by many US internet firms. Chew insisted that his company was independent and not an arm of the Chinese government or the Communist Party. But despite not producing evidence or any proof to support their claims of potential interference from Beijing, the lawmakers said they didn’t believe him. There was a pageant of political performance in the hearing, as lawmakers from both parties relished a chance to show who could be tough on China. TikTok issued a statement bemoaning a day “dominated by political grandstanding that failed to acknowledge the real solutions already underway through Project Texas or productively address industry-wide issues of youth safety.” The hostility of some of the lawmakers illustrated how opposition to China has become one of the dominant organizing principles of Washington politics and a rare issue that unites both parties. But the tone of some of the questions and the disrespect shown to Chew also explained why some Asian American groups are worried that fierce hostility toward Beijing in Washington could translate into more intimidation and violence against Asian Americans across the country. The essence of Washington’s distrust over TikTok’s capacity to protect data was reflected in repeated exchanges between Chew and the House committee over the firm’s Project Texas, which, if anything, appeared to leave lawmakers more skeptical than they had been before. This is because Chew was often unable to sufficiently assure lawmakers that the Chinese government wouldn’t access its user data in the future, even though he argued it would be contained in American servers on US soil. “I have seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data; they have never asked us, we have not provided it,” Chew said at one point, causing Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California to remark, “I don’t believe … that you have said or done anything to convince us.” Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee who has written legislation giving President Joe Biden more power to ban TikTok, explained why Washington perceives a video app as such a threat. “One of the geniuses of TikTok is it learns from you. Every time you’re on the site, it starts to get to know you, what you like better than even what you know. Do you want all that information ultimately residing under the guise of the Communist Party of China?” Warner said on “CNN This Morning.” “Number two, this is a powerful propaganda machine if it’s used that way. This is an incredible misinformation, disinformation machine. I’m not saying they’re doing it right now, but that potential, if President Xi in China wants to somehow invade … Taiwan, and suddenly folks not only in America but around the world are starting to see videos that reinforces that kind of message, that is a propaganda tool that makes every other possibility pale.” The broadening concerns about China’s massive intelligence capabilities are an increasingly frequent topic in Washington – especially in relation to the spy balloon drama and TikTok, and they were also due to spill over into talks on Friday between Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa. “We’ve consistently seen that the Chinese government use whatever tools it can to get information, get data that is going to be advantageous to its aims around the world,” Trudeau told CNN’s Paula Newton in an exclusive interview on Thursday. “And we’ve also seen that Chinese owned or Chinese directed companies are very much answerable to the Communist Party of China.” Trudeau’s comments underscore why TikTok’s time may be running out in the US – at least as part of a wider Chinese company. If the app was owned by a Belgian firm or one from Australia, for instance, there might still be concerns over its addictive properties and data protection, but it would not have to battle the impression it represents a dangerous window for a US adversary. As Thursday’s hearing showed, TikTok is caught up in geopolitical forces between the US and China that are far larger than even its vast consumer base and that raise questions that are proving impossible for it to answer – at least to the satisfaction of the US Congress.

","text":["We’ve had people tracking their bags when airlines can’t find them. Now here’s something new: a passenger tracking an item she left on a plane – to an airport employee’s home. Earlier in March, Alisabeth Hayden, from Washington state in the US, was separated from her AirPods – Apple’s pricey micro headphones – while disembarking from a plane in San Francisco. She swiftly realized that they appeared to have been stolen. But after nearly two weeks, she had them back – thanks to her tenacious tracking abilities. Hayden was flying back from a trip to Tokyo to visit her husband, who is on secondment in the military, when she was parted from the earphones. Disembarking from the plane at San Francisco International Airport – and a little disoriented after a nine-hour flight from Tokyo – she left her denim jacket on her seat, at the back of the plane. “I realized before I was even off the plane,” she says. “I was the third from last off the plane, so I asked the flight attendant if I could go and get it. He said no – I was required by federal law to get off the plane and stand beside it, where the strollers are brought to. I was tired, he said he’d bring it to me, I said OK.” He did indeed bring it to her – and she boarded her next flight to Seattle. “A child was screaming next to me and I thought, ‘At least I have my AirPods,’” she remembers. She reached for her jacket – she’d left the two breast pockets buttoned up, one with her earphones, one with some Japanese Yen inside it. “The pockets were open, and my AirPods were gone,” she says.   The plane had already taken off to Seattle, but Hayden used inflight Wi-Fi to track the earphones using the “Find My” app, which tracks Apple devices. The AirPods were showing at SFO. Then she realized they were moving. “I’m a diligent person, and I tracked the whole way from San Francisco to Seattle, taking screenshots the entire time. I live an hour from Seattle, and once I got home, I was still taking screenshots,” she says. The AirPods by now were showing up at a place on the map called “United Cargo” – still within the airport, but the cargo side of the airline, so not where a passenger would be likely to be.   Then they moved to Terminal 2. Then to Terminal 3. Then they were on Highway 101, heading south towards San Mateo. They ended up at what appeared to be a residential address in the Bay Area, and stayed put there for three days. Of course, everyone’s gadgets are precious, but Hayden’s AirPods hold particular significance – they’re her link to her husband, who calls her from his deployment on such a bad line that she needs them to hear him. From the minute she realized they were gone, Hayden was trying to get them back. She messaged United and SFO from the plane, then tried the police in San Francisco, Hayward (where the tracker was showing), and SFO’s own airport police. She worked out the email format for United employee emails, and “blasted” every single executive she could find, across the globe. “I hit every avenue I could find, and used every possible form of communication, and got the same response: ‘I’m sorry that happened to you,’” she says.   In the meantime, she says, she marked the AirPods as “lost” on the app, so that anyone who used them would hear a message telling them that they were hers, and giving them her phone number. United, she says, were “godawful” in their communications with her. “First they were like, ‘I’m sorry you lost your belongings on our flight.’ I was like, ‘I didn’t lose them, I was denied the ability to get my jacket by an employee… and now my $250 AirPods are missing.’”     The person who helped? A detective from San Mateo police force, working at the airport. He matched the address the earphones were pinging from to an address for an employee of the airport – a contractor working to load food onto aircraft. United would later clarify to Hayden in an email that they were “not a United employee but a vendor.” She says now: “I can’t make any assumptions, but what I know is that they were in the pocket when I got up, I wasn’t allowed back to my seat, and by the time the steward brought [the jacket] to me they weren’t there – and when I tracked them, they were at an employee’s house.” United confirmed to CNN that the employee works for a United vendor, and said that the matter has been handed over to law enforcement. It added in a statement: “United Airlines holds our vendors to the highest standards and we are working with local authorities in their investigation of this matter.”   Hayden says the detective told her that “the information had been given to United Cargo, and they were going to call this person into the office and question him.” “For the next few days, I was watching my AirPods at this man’s house. They should have died, because I hadn’t charged them before my trip, but I kept getting a notification on that they had been ‘seen’ [by the app] – which meant someone had connected their iPhone to the AirPods.”  A few days later, the detective called her again to say that the employee had been questioned. He’d denied having the AirPods, until being shown the tracking screenshots at his home – at which point he said that he’d been given them by one of the airplane cleaners. That person denied all knowledge of the situation. The matter is now being handled by the San Francisco Airport Police Department, which plans to submit the case to the San Mateo District Attorney’s office, a spokesperson for San Mateo County confirmed to CNN. After 12 days of chasing, Hayden finally got her AirPods back – although not in peak condition. “They look like they’ve been stomped on,” she says. “They were wrapped in a toilet paper-sized piece of bubble wrap, Why bother?” When she flagged United about their condition, she says, she was told to leave feedback through the contact form on its website. A week later, and after CNN first contacted the airline about her case, Hayden was told she would receive $271.91 in “expenses” (to buy a new pair) plus 5,000 miles as an apology.   Hayden – who always travels with an AirTag in her luggage, too – says she’d love to be the last case of alleged theft from a plane. “I’m tenacious – but what about the people who don’t have the time, or who give up? How many people will be told, ‘You left them behind, what do you expect?’” she asks.  She calls the detective who helped her “amazing.” In the meantime, with her AirPods recovered, she can communicate with her husband again. “Maybe they look like AirPods to normal people, but it’s my lifeline to my husband and means something different to me,” she says. “But I shouldn’t have to explain for someone to care.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[11,0],"topic_weights":[97,3],"title":"TikTok CEO in the hot seat: 5 takeaways ","text":["In his first appearance before Congress on Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Chew was grilled by lawmakers who expressed deep skepticism about his company’s attempts to protect US user data and ease concerns about its ties to China. It was a rare chance for the public to hear from the Chew, who offers very few interviews. Yet his company’s app is among the most popular in America, with more than 150 million active users. Here are the biggest takeaways from Thursday’s hearing. The hearing, which lasted for more than five hours, kicked off with calls from a lawmaker to ban the app in the United States and remained combative throughout. It offered a vivid display of the bipartisan push to crack down on the popular short-form video app and the company’s uphill battle to improve relations with Washington. Washington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, opened Thursday’s hearing by telling Shou: “Your platform should be banned.” Chew used his testimony to stress TikTok’s independence from China and play up its US ties. “TikTok itself is not available in mainland China, we’re headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, and we have 7,000 employees in the U.S. today,” he said in his opening remarks. “Still, we have heard important concerns about the potential for unwanted foreign access to US data and potential manipulation of the TikTok US ecosystem,” Chew said. “Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action.” TikTok doesn’t operate in China. But since the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, the theory goes that ByteDance, and thus indirectly, TikTok, could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities, including possibly the transfer of TikTok data. Much of Chew’s attempts to stress that his company is not an arm of the Chinese government appeared to fall on deaf ears. Numerous members of Congress interrupted the chief executive’s testimony to say they simply don’t believe him. “To the American people watching today, hear this: TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on you, manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations,” said Rep. McMorris Rodgers. In an exchange with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo, Chew talked up TikTok’s ongoing efforts to protect US user data and said he has “seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data; they have never asked us, we have not provided it.” “I find that actually preposterous,” Eshoo fired back. “I have looked in — and I have seen no evidence of this happening,” Chew responded. “Our commitment is to move their data into the United States, to be stored on American soil by an American company, overseen by American personnel. So the risk would be similar to any government going to an American company, asking for data.” “I don’t believe that TikTok — that you have said or done anything to convince us,” Eshoo said. As lawmakers doubled down on their questions about TikTok’s data collection practices, Chew also emphasized that the data TikTok collects is data “that’s frequently collected by many other companies in our industry.” “We are committed to be very transparent with our users about what we collect,” Chew said. “I don’t believe what we collect is more than most players in the industry.” Independent researchers have backed Chew’s assertions. In 2020, The Washington Post worked with a privacy researcher to look under the hood at TikTok, concluding that the app does not appear to collect any more data than your typical mainstream social network. The following year, Pellaeon Lin, a Taiwan-based researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, performed another technical analysis that reached similar conclusions. Still, even if TikTok collects about the same amount of information as Facebook or Twitter, that’s still quite a lot of data, including information about the videos you watch, comments you write, private messages you send, and — if you agree to grant this level of access — your exact geolocation and contact lists. (On Thursday, Chew said that current versions of TikTok do not collect precise GPS information from US users.) While national security was expected to be the primary focus of the hearing, multiple lawmakers also highlighted concerns about TikTok’s impact on children. New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, ranking member of the committee, for example, said Thursday: “Research has found that TikTok’s algorithms recommend videos to teens that create and exacerbate feelings of emotional distress, including videos promoting suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.” Rep. Bob Latta, a Republican from Ohio, accused TikTok of promoting a video on the so-called “blackout challenge” or choking challenge to the feed of a 10-year-old girl from Pennsylvania, who later died after trying to mimic the challenge in the video. Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida also said there is a lack of adequate content moderation, which leaves room for kids to be exposed to content that promotes self harm. “Your technology is literally leading to death,” Bilirakis said to Chew. Citing examples of harmful content served to children, he said, “it is unacceptable, sir, that even after knowing all these dangers, you still claim that TikTok is something grand to behold.” TikTok, for its parts, has launched a number of features in recent months to provide additional safeguards for younger users, including setting a new 60-minute default for daily time limit for those under the age of 18. Even that feature, however, was criticized by lawmakers as being too easy for teens to bypass. Rep. Tony Cárdenas, a Democrat from California, blasted what he saw as Chew’s indirect responses and compared him to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in his own testimonies in the past has also frustrated some members of Congress. “You have been one of the few people to unite this committee,” Cárdenas told Chew. “You remind me a lot of Mark Zuckerberg. When he came here, I said to my staff, ‘He reminds me of Fred Astaire — good dancer with words.’ And you are doing the same today. A lot of your answers are a bit nebulous; they’re not yes or no.” Zuckerberg testified before the same house committee for hours back in 2018 in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. While both Chew and Zuckerberg lead major social media platforms, Zuckerberg was already a household name when he faced lawmakers back in 2018. Chew, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the spotlight since he took the helm of TikTok back in 2021. To prepare for his appearance Thursday, CNN learned Chew has spent the last week in near-dialy, multi-hour prep sessions. TikTok personnel have worked to sharpen and polish Chew’s presentation during these sessions. They have played the roles of lawmakers with various questioning styles, peppering Chew with practice queries and scenarios to ready him for hours of relentless interrogation. But TikTok said Congress wasn’t interested in listening to Chew’s answers. “Shou came prepared to answer questions from Congress,” TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told CNN in a statement after the hearing wrapped. “But, unfortunately, the day was dominated by political grandstanding that failed to acknowledge the real solutions already underway.” Perhaps no exchange summed up Thursday’s hearing like a moment following Rep. Kat Cammack’s lengthy critique of TikTok’s content moderation and links to China. “Can I respond, Chair?” Chew asked McMorris Rodgers after Cammack’s time was up. McMorris Rodgers considered Chew for a brief moment. “No. We’re going to move on,” she said. Outside the hearing room, federal officials appeared to ramp up their rhetoric about TikTok. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said TikTok should be “ended one way or another,” but noted “there are different ways of doing that.” Speaking at a separate House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Blinken said he did not know if it would be sufficient for TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company. The top US diplomat said he believed the app is a threat to US national security, but would not outright say that it should be banned. “Clearly, we, the administration and others are seized with the challenge that it poses and are taking action to address it,” he said. In a separate statement on Thursday that did not address or name TikTok specifically, the US Treasury Department — the agency that chairs the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS) — warned that it “will not clear any transaction unless it determines there are no unresolved national security concerns.” “Broadly speaking, some transactions can present data security risks — including providing a foreign person or government with access to troves of Americans’ sensitive personal data as well as access to intellectual property, source code, or other potentially sensitive information,” a Department spokesperson said. “CFIUS, on a case-by-case basis, will ensure the protection of national security, including to prevent the misuse of data through espionage, tracking, and other means that threaten national security.” For more than two years, CFIUS and TikTok have been negotiating on a possible deal that might address US security concerns and allow the app to continue operating in the United States. But in his testimony, Chew attempted to ease the longstanding concerns about the app and called the fears of Chinese government access to TikTok’s user data “hypothetical.” “I think a lot of risks that are pointed out are hypothetical and theoretical risks,” Chew said. “I have not seen any evidence. I am eagerly awaiting discussions where we can talk about evidence and then we can address the concerns that are being raised.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[11,2,7,5],"topic_weights":[67,15,14,4],"title":"TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. So","text":["TikTok is fighting to stay alive in the United States as pressure builds in Washington to ban the app if its Chinese owners don’t sell the company. But the wildly popular platform, developed with homegrown Chinese technology, isn’t accessible in China. In fact, it’s never existed there. Instead, there’s a different version of TikTok — a sister app called Douyin. Both are owned by Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, but Douyin launched before TikTok and became a viral sensation in China. Its powerful algorithm became the foundation for TikTok and is key to its global success. But the two platforms, similar on the surface, play by starkly different rules. Here’s what you need to know about Douyin and ByteDance: Douyin has a whopping 600 million users a day. Like TikTok, it’s a short-form video app. Launched in 2016, Douyin was the major money spinner for ByteDance years before TikTok, raking in revenue through in-app tipping and livestreaming. ByteDance was founded by Zhang Yiming, a former Microsoft employee, and first became known for its news app Jinri Toutiao or “Today’s Headlines,” which debuted in 2012 soon after the company was founded. Toutiao created customized news feeds for each user. People quickly got hooked, with users averaging more than 70 minutes a day on the platform. ByteDance applied a similar formula to Douyin. Then in 2017, the privately-owned tech company bought a US-based video startup and released TikTok as the overseas version of Douyin. It also bought popular lip syncing app musical.ly, and moved those users onto TikTok in 2018. The app’s popularity has since gone global. In 2021, TikTok reached more than 1 billion monthly active users around the world. The TikTok and Douyin interfaces look similar, but when users turn on their cameras, one difference becomes clear: Douyin has an automatic beauty filter, which smooths out skin and often changes the shape of a person’s face.  Women in China have long faced huge pressure to conform to beauty standards that emphasize a slim figure, large eyes, dewy skin and high cheekbones. There is surging demand for plastic surgery. Between 2014 and 2017, the number of people getting plastic surgery in China more than doubled. Meanwhile, beauty apps compete to create filters that show users more beautiful versions of themselves. While TikTok also has beauty filters, users can select them when filming. They do not launch automatically. Another major difference between TikTok and Douyin is China’s massive online shopping market. Livestreaming sales of products is a multibillion-dollar industry in mainland China, and was given a major boost during the pandemic. As of June last year, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing’s commerce ministry. Douyin is a major platform for livestreamers, along with Taobao, Alibaba’s\n            \n                (BABA) eBay-like online marketplace. In-app shopping is made easy: Products and discounts are displayed on-screen during livestreams, with purchases just a swipe or a click away. China has one of the world’s strictest censorship regimes, and Douyin must follow the rules. Internet watchdogs crack down regularly on online dissent and block politically sensitive information. When CNN searched “Tiananmen 1989” in Douyin, nothing came up.  The Tiananmen massacre, in which Chinese troops cracked down brutally on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing, has been wiped from China’s history books. Any discussion of the event is strictly censored and controlled. When CNN searched the same phrase in TikTok, it yielded many results including videos of users talking about what happened and a brief Wikipedia blurb summarizing the event.  “It’s so interesting to see this contradiction in this one company [ByteDance] with these two faces,” said Duncan Clark, chairman and founder of investment advisory BDA China. Another key difference: Douyin takes a much stricter line on younger users. Users under 14 can access only child-safe content and use the app for just 40 minutes a day and. They can’t use the app from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  For years, China has tried to curb video game addiction and other unhealthy online habits. It announced a curfew for online gaming for minors in 2019, before outright banning online gaming during weekdays for minors. Even on most weekends, users under 18 are only allowed to play for three hours. “There’s been very much a laissez-faire attitude in the US towards content, even content targeting teenagers and vulnerable people,” said Clark. “The Chinese government has been much more leaning into regulation at early stages in the growth of Douyin, particularly protecting younger people.” TikTok took some similar steps earlier this month, announcing that every user under 18 will soon have their accounts default to a one-hour daily screen time limit, though teenage users will be able to turn off this new default setting.  TikTok is not the only Chinese-owned platform finding viral success in the United States. Of the top 10 most popular free apps on  Apple’s \n            \n                (AAPL)US app store, four were developed with Chinese technology. Besides TikTok, there’s also shopping app Temu, fast fashion retailer Shein and video editing app CapCut, which is also owned by ByteDance. TikTok remains hugely popular in the United States, with more than 150 million monthly users — almost half of the country’s population. It remains to be seen whether TikTok can convince US lawmakers that it poses no threat — but the showdown in Washington has highlighted larger questions about security and data privacy that could see other apps come under fire.   These apps could be next, said Clark. He said the US needs a “more sophisticated framework for regulating the big tech companies,” given the number of US investors and users on foreign platforms. “They need to also think about how high they’re gonna raise the bar for Chinese investment in the US, and the consequences of completely excluding four of the top ten apps,” said Clark. “What’s gonna replace them? And how is that going to play out? And how is that equitable to the investors in those apps versus US players?” he added. “It’s a mess.” — CNN’s Riley Zhang contributed reporting.

To be able to contribute in any way to that mission as a member of the Aces organization is an incredible honor.” Brady said his love for women’s sports grew out of watching his older sisters, who were “by far the best athletes in our house!” Brady announced his retirement from the NFL in February after 23 seasons with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  During his long career, the three-time league MVP set almost every passing record, including regular season passing yards (89,214) and passing touchdowns (649). He has also amassed the most wins of any player in NFL history (251). “Since I purchased the Aces, our goal has been to win on and off the court,” said Davis, who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders. “Tom Brady is a win not only for the Aces, and the WNBA, but for women’s professional sports as a whole.” Davis purchased the WNBA franchise before the 2021 season. Brady’s partial acquisition of the team is subject to WNBA approval. The Aces enter the upcoming season as reigning WNBA champions. The team opens the season against the Seattle Storm on May 20 at Climate Pledge Arena in Washington. In October, Brady joined the ownership group of an expansion Major League Pickleball team, along with former tennis World No. 1 Kim Clijsters, who in December attended the draft to support their new squad, the Las Vegas Night Owls.

Credit Suisse r","text":["The last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse may have prevented the current banking crisis from exploding, but it’s a raw deal for Switzerland. Worries that Credit Suisse’s downfall would spark a broader banking meltdown left Swiss regulators with few good options. A tie-up with its larger rival, UBS\n            \n                (UBS), offered the best chance of restoring stability in the banking sector globally and in Switzerland, and protecting the Swiss economy in the near term. But it leaves Switzerland exposed to a single massive financial institution, even as there is still huge uncertainty over how successful the mega merger will prove to be. “One of the most established facts in academic research is that bank mergers hardly ever work,” said Arturo Bris, a professor of finance at Swiss business school IMD. There are also concerns that the deal will lead to huge job losses in Switzerland and weaken competition in the country’s vital financial sector, which overall employs more than 5% of the national workforce, or nearly 212,000 people. Taxpayers, meanwhile, are now on the hook for up to 9 billions Swiss francs ($9.8 billion) of future potential losses at UBS arising from certain Credit Suisse assets, provided those losses exceed 5 billion francs ($5.4 billion). The state has also explicitly guaranteed a 100 billion Swiss franc ($109 billion) lifeline to UBS, should it need it, although that would be repayable.   Switzerland’s Social Democratic party has already called for an investigation into what went wrong at Credit Suisse, arguing that the newly created “super-megabank” increases risks for the Swiss economy. The demise of one of Switzerland’s oldest institutions has come as a shock to many of its citizens. Credit Suisse is “part of Switzerland’s identity,” said Hans Gersbach, a professor of macroeconomics at ETH university in Zurich. The bank “has been instrumental in the development of modern Switzerland.” Its collapse has also tainted Switzerland’s reputation as a safe and stable global financial center, particularly after the government effectively stripped shareholders of voting rights to get the deal done. Swiss authorities also wiped out some bondholders ahead of shareholders, upending the traditional hierarchy of losses in a bank failure and dealing another blow to the country’s reputation among investors. “The repercussions for Switzerland are terrible,” said Bris of IMD. “For a start, the reputation of Switzerland has been damaged forever.” That will benefit other wealth management centers, including Singapore, he told CNN. Singaporeans are “celebrating… because there is going to be a huge inflow of funds into other wealth management jurisdictions.” At roughly $1.7 trillion, the combined assets of the new entity amount to double the size of Switzerland’s annual economic output. By deposits and loans to Swiss customers, UBS will now be bigger than the next two local banks combined. With a roughly 30% market share in Swiss banking, “we see too much concentration risk and market share control,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note last week before the deal was done. They suggested that the combined entity would need to exit or IPO some businesses. The problem with having one single large bank in a small economy is that if it faces a bank run or needs a bailout — which UBS did during the 2008 crisis — the government’s financial firepower may be insufficient. At 333 billion francs ($363 billion), local deposits in the new entity equal 45% of GDP — an enormous amount even for a country with healthy public finances and low levels of debt.  On the other hand, UBS is in a much stronger financial position than it was during the 2008 crisis and it will be required to build up an even bigger financial buffer as a result of the deal. The Swiss financial regulator, FINMA, has said it will “very closely monitor the transaction and compliance with all requirements under supervisory law.” UBS chairman Colm Kelleher underscored the health of UBS’s balance sheet Sunday at a press conference on the deal. “Having been chief financial officer [at Morgan Stanley] during the last global financial crisis, I’m well aware of the importance of a solid balance sheet. UBS will remain rock-solid,” he said. Kelleher added that UBS would trim Credit Suisse’s investment bank “and align it with our conservative risk culture.” Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said “the question of market concentration in Switzerland is something to address in future.” “30% [market share] is higher than you might ideally want but not so high that it’s a major problem.” The deal has “surgically removed the most worrying part of [Switzerland’s] banking system,” leaving it stronger, Kenningham added. The deal will have an adverse affect on jobs, though, likely adding to the 9,000 cuts that Credit Suisse already announced as part of an earlier turnaround plan. For Switzerland, the threat is acute. The two banks collectively employ more than 37,000 people in the country, about 18% of the financial sector’s workforce, and there is bound to be overlap. “The Credit Suisse branch in the city where I live is right in front of UBS’s, meaning one of the two will certainly close,” Bris of IMD  wrote in a note Monday. In a call with analysts Sunday night, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank would try to remove 8 billion francs ($8.9 billion) of costs a year by 2027, 6 billion francs ($6.5 billion) of which would come from reducing staff numbers. “We are clearly cognizant of Swiss societal and economic factors. We will be considerate employers, but we need to do this in a rational way,” Kelleher told reporters.   Not only does the deal, done in a hurry, fail to protect jobs in Switzerland, but it contains no special provisions on competition issues. UBS now has “quasi-monopoly power,” which could increase the cost of banking services in the country, according to Bris. Although Switzerland has dozens of smaller regional and savings banks, including 24 cantonal banks, UBS is now an even more dominant player. “Everything they do… will influence the market,” said Gersbach of ETH. Credit Suisse’s Swiss banking arm, arguably its crown jewel, could have been subject to a future sale as part of the terms of the deal, he added. A spinoff of the domestic bank now looks unlikely, however, after UBS made clear that it intended to hold onto it. “The Credit Suisse Swiss bank is a fine asset that we are very determined to keep,” Kelleher said Sunday. At $3.25 billion, UBS got Credit Suisse for 60% less than the bank was worth when markets closed two days prior. Whether that ultimately turns out to be a steal remains to be seen. Large mergers are notoriously fraught with risk and often don’t deliver the promised returns to shareholders. UBS argues that by expanding its global wealth and asset management franchise, the deal will drive long-term shareholder value. “UBS’s strength and our familiarity with Credit Suisse’s business puts us in a unique position to execute this integration efficiently and effectively,” Kelleher said. UBS expects the deal to increase its profit by 2027. The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, but fully integrating the two institutions will take three to five years, according to Phillip Straley, the president of data analytics company FNA. “There’s a huge amount of integration risk,” he said.  Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed its credit ratings on UBS but changed the outlook on some of its debt from stable to negative, judging that the “complexity, extent and duration of the integration” posed risks to the bank. It pointed to challenges retaining key Credit Suisse staff, minimizing the loss of overlapping clients in Switzerland and unifying the cultures of “two somewhat different organizations.” According to Kenningham of Capital Economics, the “track record of shotgun marriages in the banking sector is mixed.” “Some, such as the 1995 purchase of Barings by ING, have proved long-lasting. But others, including several during the global financial crisis, soon brought into question the viability of the acquiring bank, while others have proven very difficult to implement.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[10],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"Torture, forced abortions and insects fo","text":["Extrajudicial executions, rape, forced abortions, jail without trial, torture, starvation rations that leave prisoners so hungry some turn to eating insects. These are just some of the abuses commonplace in North Korean prisons and other detention facilities, according to former detainees whose testimony forms the basis of a new report released by a human rights watchdog this week. Using interviews with hundreds of survivors, witnesses and perpetrators of abuse who have fled the country, along with official documents, satellite images, architectural analysis and digital modeling of penal facilities, the non-profit NGO Korea Future has built up what it says is the most detailed picture yet of life inside the secretive country’s penal system. “The purpose of our report is basically to reveal the human rights violations that have taken place within North Korea’s penal systems. (It) finds that even 10 years after the UN established a Commission of Inquiry there still is systematic and widespread human rights violations,” said Kim Jiwon, an investigator with Korea Future, which has offices in London, Seoul and The Hague and focuses on human rights issues in North Korea. Alongside constructing 3D models of some of the detention sites, the group has documented what it believes are more than 1,000 instances of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, hundreds of instances of rape and other forms of sexual violence and more than 100 cases of denial of the right to life. “Comparable to the Soviet Gulag, (North Korea’s) penal system is not to detain and rehabilitate persons sentenced by courts in safe and humane facilities. Nor is its purpose to decrease recidivism and increase public safety,” the report says. “It is to isolate persons from society whose behaviour conflicts with upholding the singular authority of the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un.” The report states it has identified hundreds of active participants it alleges have participated in the violence and is calling for investigations and prosecutions for the abuses. Korea Future used witness testimony and satellite imagery to map 206 detention facilities, across every North Korean province, alleging that abuses are personally carried out by officials as high-ranking as major generals. A 3D model of one of the detention centers, recreated by CNN with information from Korea Future.   The report makes for grim reading. Among the cases it highlights are those of three people jailed after trying to cross the border – a punishable crime in this country. The group alleges one was forced to have an abortion when seven or eight months pregnant; another was fed as little as 80 grams (less than 3 ounces) of corn a day, a starvation diet that saw his weight drop from 60 kilograms (132 pounds) to 37 kilograms (82 pounds) within a month and forced him to supplement his diet with cockroaches and rodents; a third was forced to hold stress positions for up to 17 hours a day for 30 days. Other survivors, who spoke to CNN, recounted surviving on animal feed and becoming skeletally thin, witnessing rapes and being subject to severe beatings. Korea Future is hoping other countries will consider pursuing domestic court cases against North Korean agents and that some of its findings can be used as evidence. And, it hopes western countries will apply targeted sanctions against some of the accused in the report. Due to North Korea’s self-imposed isolation, which has become even stricter since the country closed its borders in 2020 in response to Covid-19, CNN cannot independently verify the accounts. However, the conditions outlined in the report are in line with the findings of recent investigations by the United Nations, including a report to the UN Human Rights council this week by Special Rapporteur Elizabeth Salmón, who said women detained in political prison camps were “subjected to torture and ill-treatment, forced labor and gender-based violence, including sexual violence by state officials.” A reconstruction by Korea Future of detainees (in blue) carrying out forced labour in a North Korean field. The prison guard is in orange.  The hermit country is known as one of the most closed and repressive nations in the world. CNN has sought comment from North Korea’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York for comment, but it has not responded. North Korea frequently denies allegations of human rights abuses – in its prisons or elsewhere – often claiming they are part of a US-orchestrated campaign against it. This week, soon after a UN meeting on the human rights situation in the country, North Korea released a statement saying it “resolutely denounces and rejects” what it characterized as a “US-waged human rights pressure campaign.” “That such a country takes issue with the ‘human rights’ situation of other countries is indeed a mockery of and an insult to human rights itself,” reads the statement. Referring to a joint military exercise between the US and South Korea, it claimed the US was using its “human rights maneuver as a mechanism for invading” North Korea.  Investigators from both Korea Future and the UN say many inmates become so dehumanized by the abuse that they begin to feel they somehow deserve it. Many, too, simply have no concept of human rights with which to frame their experience. One former inmate, who says she was detained for little over a year from 2015 after complaining to authorities over her housing situation, likened her treatment to that of an animal. “When we raise rabbits, we keep them in dens with fences and give them food. (In jail), it was like we were the rabbits, kept in a cell and given food from behind bars … we were not treated as humans, but as some kind of animal,” said the survivor, whose name CNN has agreed to protect as in North Korea the families of defectors can face retribution. The location of North Hamgyong provincial holding center, according to co-ordinates supplied by Korea Future to CNN.  At one point her cell was around two square meters (21.5 square feet), “and I know this because we were sleeping zig-zag stye and someone’s feet were touching my shoulders.” “We should not move in the cell and we had to sit with our hands on our sides and as we were not supposed to look up we had to look down. We were not supposed to talk, so all you hear is people’s breathing sound.” She described being fed only corn mixed with rice bran – more commonly used as animal feed. “How can it be enough? When you eat breakfast, from the moment you put down your spoon, you’re hungry. It’s all grass and no nutrition so you get hungry as you don’t even feel the food inside your stomach. “All your nutrition in your body is gone so you end up looking like a skeleton by the time you leave, just right before dying.” She was released after a little more than a year inside. “I didn’t feel like I was a human being. I thought it would’ve been better to be dead if I had to live like that.”  North Korea has long faced claims of torture and abuse in its political prison camps, known as “kwalliso”. A landmark UN investigation in 2014 found that Pyongyang was using this type of camp to keep a lid on dissent – and the ruling Kim dynasty in power – and that up to 120,000 people were held in them. It also estimated that over the past few decades hundreds of thousands of political prisoners had died in kwalliso amid “unspeakable atrocities.” Among Korea Future’s key contentions is that similar methods of abuse are being used “systematically” in ordinary prisons, known as “kyohwaso,” and other penal institutes such as holding centers and prosecution offices. Not only that, but it says the abuse in these centers is “greater in scale … than in better-known political prison camps” and that while some of the people held in kyohwaso are accused of standard crimes, such as theft, many are being held essentially as political prisoners. The report places responsibility on North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. “The purpose of (North Korea’s) penal system is to isolate persons from society whose behaviour conflicts with upholding the singular authority of the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un,” states the report. “Detainees are re-educated through forced labour, ideological instruction, and punitive brutality with the purpose of compelling unquestioning obedience and loyalty to the Supreme Leader.”  Kim Jiwon, the Korea Future investigator who interviewed many of the survivors, praised their courage in speaking up, adding that he had found it was “really, really difficult to hear their stories.” “I can’t even fathom how they felt, and what they had to go through,” he said. While difficult, asking the survivors to relive their experiences and cross checking their accounts against each other had been vital in corroborating and building up a picture of what had occurred, Kim said. Among the things that had struck him during the interviews was that, so dehumanizing had their treatment been, that many “just didn’t have the concept of torture.” “They were always told by the penal facility, the correctional officers, that they had done something bad. So they just simply thought that they were bad people and for that reason, they were being punished. This was very ingrained in their mindset,” Kim said. “They didn’t even realize that they were being subjected to torture.”  A 3D model of one of the detention centers, recreated by CNN with data from Korea Future.  A male survivor whose testimony was used in the Korea Future report told CNN he had been detained multiple times for defection, including in 2000 and 2017, after making his way across the border with China to seek work. While he described seeing prison guards raping women detainees, being beaten up and forced to walk around with his body bowed at a right angle during one spell in jail, he said the conditions were an improvement on his first experience. “In the past, we had to crawl with both hands and knees when we were moving, but in 2017, we could stand up and walk. All you needed was to bend your back forward 90 degrees when moving,” he said. He said as many as five people would be held in a single 6.6 square meter room (71 square feet) that had no heating, but that at least in 2017 they were given blankets to help them cope with the cold – winter temperatures in North Korea can fall  as low as minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 degrees Celsius) – unlike when he was imprisoned in 2000, when they were given nothing. He even went as far as to describe some periods of his detention as “no stress,” at one point moving to a center where there were no beatings or torture and thinking “wow, Korea has been changed.” But he painted a bleaker picture of one holding center. “I noticed the center guards were raping female detainees at night. They’d ask some women to wash their clothes at night and when the women came out they raped (them)… I thought some things haven’t changed after all these years.” A survivor from a North Korean detention center speaks to CNN.  He said he told an inspector what he had seen and that initially he was thanked for bringing the matter up, but soon afterward two men beat him up “so hard.” Soon afterward, “I thought I couldn’t live like this so I broke the window in the room and grabbed a piece of glass,” he said. “The police guard came into my room and in front of them I stabbed my tummy.” Despite all this, he said it was better to focus on those aspects that had improved – likening it to encouraging a child, saying that focusing purely on bad behavior would not encourage them to change for the better. He said in 2017 he received three meals a day and the same food as the police were eating, unlike in 2000 when his rations were only vegetable soup. “We were used to being called like sons of bitches back in 2000,” he said. “But in 2017, we were called comrades.”  James Heenan, representative of the UN Human Rights Office in Seoul, said many escapees simply didn’t have a concept of human rights; one of the first steps in helping them was to educate them so they could recognize that what had happened to them was abuse. “Generally they tell us the raw, unadulterated version of what happened to them and sometimes they see it as a bad thing. Sometimes I think that’s just the way the system works. (They think,) ‘I was beaten because I deserved it.’ So the issue of knowledge of human rights is a key one.” Heenan said the abuse fit into four main categories. Firstly, people were being detained arbitrarily and either not given a trial or given a show trial, without a lawyer, that might be as short as 10 minutes, he said. Secondly, people were being tortured and subject to other forms of ill treatment related to health, food and sanitation that could be “tantamount to torture if it’s done in a certain way,” he said. James Heenan, of the UN Human Rights Office, speaks to CNN.  Thirdly, “We also see the issue of extrajudicial executions in prison, people who are just executed from prison without trial are subjected to the death penalty,” he said. “And the final thing that we see (is) forced labor. People in prisons, in detention, are forced to work in inhumane conditions for no pay for the profit of the state. And this is one of the most widespread violations we see.” After the outbreak of Covid-19 prompted North Korea to shut down its few remaining connections with the outside world, it became harder to know what was happening in the detention centers, Heenan added. While prior to that, some escapees like the one who spoke to CNN, had suggested “limited improvements” with perhaps fewer cases of torture and extrajudicial killings, he cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from this saying there were too many “blind spots.” “(For instance), many people are sent to political prison camps on lists, and not many people leave – they’re there for life until they die. So firsthand experience of most of these centers has always been difficult to come by,” he said. But rights groups could be confident that such abuses were still occurring, he said, and that the situation was “still very dire,” because the testimonies of survivors were cross-checked for consistency, or “triangulated,” not only against other survivors but against medical evidence of their injuries and in some cases satellite evidence. “These individuals are telling consistent stories … you also have the sheer weight of testimony, he said. “In these cases, the weight of evidence, the weight of testimony is very, very strong.” The situation in detention facilities was “one of the most egregious examples of the (human rights) violations we see (in North Korea),” Heenan added. “And this is what the UN Commission (and most others) have concluded, that the things like torture and ill treatment and so forth that are going on in those facilities reaches the level of a crime against humanity.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[0,5,2,4,3],"topic_weights":[46,32,12,6,5],"title":"Tracking the opioid crisis: Inside the D","text":["Sitting among the warehouses of Dulles, Virginia, is one of the US Drug Enforcement Administration’s forensic labs. It’s one of eight across the country where scientists analyze illegal drugs and try to stay ahead of what’s driving deadly overdoses. Starting in the late 1990s with overprescribing of prescription narcotics, the opioid epidemic has continued to plague the United States for decades. What has changed is the type of drugs that have killed more than half a million people during the past 20 years.   CNN was granted rare access to the secret lab where the DEA tests seized illicit drugs to understand what’s coming next. “The market is constantly changing, so we are trying to do everything we can from a science base to keep up with that,” Scott Oulton, deputy assistant administrator of the DEA’s Office of Forensic Sciences, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Holding a white bag of fentanyl precursor powder – one of the chemicals used to make the opioid – Oulton explained that the illicitly made painkiller continues to be a dominant presence in the drugs officials are finding.  “This kilogram can be converted into fentanyl to make approximately 800 grams,” he said. “So it doesn’t take that much material, it’s fairly cheap, it’s inexpensive to obtain.” Fentanyl is the deadliest drug in the United States, and it’s often found in combination with other illicit drugs, including cocaine and heroin. But  increasingly, fentanyl is showing up in illicit pills disguised as common prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, even Adderall. Users buying drugs on the street that look like prescription pills may end up with a highly potent, potentially deadly drug they never intended to take. “Over 99% of what we see are fake. They contain fentanyl,” Oulton says of the pills that the agency is seizing. The 800 grams of fentanyl that Oulton held could be turned into 400,000 to 500,000 potentially lethal pills. As more and more of these lethal pills circulate, the opioid epidemic is reaching more of the population. Deena Loudon of Olney, Maryland, is among those living with its effects. “I truly love sharing Matthew with the world,” Loudon says as she flips through pictures of her son. One of her favorite memories is Matthew playing hockey – what Loudon calls his happy place.  But she also recalls his struggles with anxiety, which led him to turn to drugs. He started dabbling in them in the 10th grade. By the following year, his grades began to fall, and he couldn’t keep them high enough to stay in hockey. “He was using Xanax to help self-medicate himself and I think to help get rid of some of that angst so he could live somewhat of a normal life,” Loudon said. Matthew was always honest, almost to a fault, Loudon says. “He told me he tried everything. Like everything. Heroin, meth, crack, you name it, cocaine, whatever – until I guess he found what made him feel the best, and it was Xanax.” And as much as a mother can worry, Loudon says, Matthew always tried to reassure her. “I know what I’m doing,” he would tell her. She had heard about fentanyl showing up in pills in their area. “But you don’t ever think it’s going to happen to you,” Loudon said. She said they even had a conversation about fentanyl the day before he died. “I was sort of naive, wanting to stick my head in the sand and thinking ‘I bet he does know what he’s doing.’ ”  On November 3, 2020, she found 21-year-old Matthew on the floor of their basement. Matthew’s autopsy report lists his cause of death as fentanyl and despropionyl fentanyl intoxication. “I don’t say he overdosed. I say he died from fentanyl poisoning. … Truthfully, like, at the end of the day, to me, he was murdered, right? Because he asked for one thing. They gave him something different. And it took his life.” For a parent, she said, the hardest thing is burying their child. It’s a pain she speaks out about in hopes of keeping other families safe. “You never know what you’re gonna get,”  she warns them. When the overdose epidemic began in the US in the late 1990s, it was driven primarily by the overuse of prescription opioids like OxyContin and hydrocodone, which were essentially based on the same chemical structure as heroin. About 2010, heroin became more easily available, and a surge in heroin-related overdoses followed. Within just a few years, a rise in synthetic opioids – mostly driven by illicitly made fentanyl – led to skyrocketing overdose deaths, reaching record levels in 2021.  That year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted more than 106,000 people dying from drug overdose, an increase of nearly 15% from the previous year. Those with the highest rates of overdose deaths were adults 35 to 44, while young people ages 15 to 24 had among the lowest rates. Yet even though they have lower rates of overdose deaths overall and drug use among middle and high school students has remained fairly steady over the past decade, overdoses among young people have been climbing. According to a CDC report, among people 10 to 19 years old, the number of monthly overdose deaths increased 109% from 2019 to 2021, and deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl surged 182%.  Counterfeit pills were present in nearly 1 in 4 of those deaths, and about 40% of the time, teens who overdosed also had evidence of mental health conditions. Duke Burruss of Fairfax, Virginia, has lived those numbers. His son Richard was 22 years old when he died from a fentanyl overdose. Richard, or Will as his dad like to call him, had struggled with drug use since he was prescribed Xanax in middle school. It soon led to him buying it on the street. He had been in and out of rehabilitation and eventually was living in a recovery house less than a mile from home.  In September 2020, police following up on a call from concerned neighbors found Will’s body in his apartment. Duke Burruss says they told him they immediately suspected fentanyl – something that acted fast – noting that Will still had his phone in his hand when they found him. The police also found blue pills that looked like Xanax. “They can very readily mix fentanyl with the pill and press it, and it’ll look like a true blue pill,” Burruss said. He says he owes it to other families to speak out, to be an advocate and warn others. “It’s Russian roulette,” he said. “You’re endangering your life.” The number of pills the DEA has seized skyrocketed in just three years, from 2.2 million in 2019 to 50.6 million in 2022. The sheer volume of pills has been one of the biggest challenges for the DEA’s lab, Oulton says. As the fentanyl threat continues to grow, the Virginia facility is expanding to accommodate the analysis needed.  The lab can test for something as simple as the presence of fentanyl, but something called the purity of the pill also offers important insight. This means how much fentanyl is actually in one of these illicit pills. “Lately, we’ve been seeing a purity increase over the last year, where we used to say roughly four out of the 10 seizures that we were receiving would contain a lethal dose of greater than 2 milligrams. As of October last year, we started reporting that we’ve seen an uptick. Now we’re saying that six out of 10 of the seizures that we’re receiving contain over 2 milligrams,” Oulton said. He says they’re finding an average of 2.3 milligrams of fentanyl in each pill. Two milligrams may be the cutoff for what is considered lethal, but Oulton says that doesn’t necessarily mean a pill with 1.99 milligrams of fentanyl can’t be deadly. “One pill can kill” is his warning. “The message I would like to send out is, don’t take it,” he said. “Don’t take the chance. It’s not worth your life.” Oulton says he and his team are constantly finding new and different drugs and  substances in pills – things they’ve never seen before. One machine in the lab is almost the equivalent of an MRI in a medical office, showing the structure and detail of a pill. “We will do what we call structural elucidation to determine that this is a different version of a fentanyl that’s got a new compound and molecule that’s been added to it,” Oulton said.  They’ve seen “hundreds and hundreds of unique combinations,” he said. “We’ll see one that contains fentanyl, one with fentanyl and xylazine, one with fentanyl and caffeine, one with fentanyl and acetaminophen, and you don’t know what you’re getting.” Xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, poses a unique problem. It’s not an opioid, so even when it’s mixed with fentanyl, drugs designed to reverse an opioid overdose may not work. Narcan or naloxone, one of the more common overdose-reversing drugs, has become increasingly necessary as the prevalence and potency of illicit drugs increases. About 1.2  million doses of naloxone were dispensed by retail pharmacies in 2021, according to data published by the American Medical Association – nearly nine times more than were dispensed five years earlier. Oulton wants to be clear: The problem Isn’t with pills prescribed by your doctor and dispensed by a pharmacy – it’s the pills on the illicit market. Those, Matthew’s mother warns, are easy to get.  “The first pills [Matthew] got was in high school. And it was just flipping out, floating around, and it was easy for him to get his hands on,” she said. Loudon’s message for parents now: Keep your eyes open. “Just be mindful of what your children are doing. You just just have to keep your eyes open. And even sometimes, when you keep your eyes open, you can miss some of the warning signs, but I think a parent knows their child best, so just keep talking.”  See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[1],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"Traveling to France during the protests:","text":["Winter is over and thoughts for many travelers will be turning to that most classic of springtime destinations: Paris. But the City of Lights and many other parts of France are right now convulsing with violence amid days of fiery protests. So what’s happening, and should travelers hoping to visit one of the world’s most popular destinations change their plans? Here are some answers to key questions: Many people are unhappy with President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform, which will raise the full-pension retirement age from 62 to 64. They’re also angry that he used constitutional powers to push the reform through. In response, there have been strikes and street protests, some of which have resulted in violent clashes and destruction. This is why you might have seen images of trash piling in the streets of Paris, trains getting canceled across the country or cars burning during protests. The new law isn’t in force yet, but the leading unions behind the strike action have vowed that demonstrations will continue until Macron cancels his reform. Paris and most major cities – including Lyon, Marseille, Lille, Bordeaux and Rennes – have been hit by protests. Unions are announcing countrywide strikes a few days in advance, with the next set for March 28, but in recent days, ad hoc demonstrations have erupted in city centers. In more rural or smaller destinations, such as along the French Riviera, life goes on pretty much as usual.  Britain’s King Charles made headlines on Friday by canceling his upcoming March 26-29 state visit to France in light of the current unrest. That said, there has been no official advice from countries such as the UK or US about rethinking travel plans to France. The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office notes that demonstrations in Paris and other parts of France could turn violent and there could be “disruptions to road travel,” while ongoing strikes could “lead to disruption to services.” An advisory from the US State Department remains unchanged from October 2022, with France on a “Level 2: Exercise increased caution” status due to the ongoing threat of terrorism and civil unrest. The UK advisory notes: ​​Around 17 million British nationals visit France every year. Most visits are trouble-free. Most of the incidents related to the current outrage appear to be relatively isolated, so there’s every possibility travelers can avoid being caught up in them, provided they keep themselves informed of what’s going on. As always, travelers are advised to make sure they have appropriate insurance cover.  Most long-haul flights have been unaffected, but there’s been some impact on short-haul European and domestic air traffic. One recent nationwide strike led to reduced capacity at Orly Airport near Paris, but not Charles de Gaulle, which handles most international flights. Trains and public transport are where visitors could most feel the effects of the strikes. On strike days, currently occurring once or twice a week, the Paris Metro is unlikely to run and up to 25% of TGV inter-city high-speed trains are typically canceled. Cycling and walking remain the best ways to get around Paris, with gridlocked roads on strike days meaning even taxis are inadvisable. So far, major highways between cities have been unaffected by the strikes and protests.  Most tourist attractions remain open, except on strike days. For instance, both the Eiffel Tower and Versailles were closed during recent national strike days. It’s worth checking attraction websites before visiting. While it’s still possible to travel to Paris and have a safe vacation, it’s unlikely that current visits will be unaffected by the ongoing protests – particularly when it comes to transport. That said, as a vibrant city covering a sprawling Metro area that’s home to more than 11 million people, even during normal times, Paris can deliver the unexpected – good and bad. Visitors should keep themselves informed with what’s happening where they are and be prepared for unexpected, developing situations. There are no specific websites detailing strike or protest disruption, but transportation companies are good go-tos for service updates. – These include RATP for the Paris Metro and regional trains. – SNCF for intercity trains – Air France for flights. For getting about Paris, the Citymapper app seems to have the most up-to-date information on traffic and subway schedules. It’s too early to tell since the situation is currently constantly changing.

Firefighters stood back as a yardslong trail of bright orange and red flames roared from the pavement, fueling thick black smoke that rose into the predawn darkness, an image released by the Baltimore County Fire Department shows. The tanker overturned and was the only vehicle involved in the crash, Sgt. Arthur Horton of Maryland State Police told CNN. A tanker strike team responded, the fire department said. The crash on I-795 forced all ramps from inner and outer loops to close, Maryland’s State Highway Administration said. The fire was put out, the fire department said in a Twitter post shortly before 9 a.m., and crews were working with the Maryland Department of the Environment to contain diesel fuel. “Beltway will be shut down for an extended period. Avoid the area,” the fire department said. The tanker driver was taken to a local trauma center with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The crash happened weeks after a deadly gas tanker explosion following a crash on a highway in nearby Frederick, Maryland. The March 4 explosion on US Route 15, about 50 miles west of Baltimore, damaged homes and vehicles and killed the tanker driver. Hazardous materials, including gasoline and diesel fuel, were contained within hours, Frederick County officials said.

Speaking with CNN’s Paula Newton, Trudeau said that in areas like climate change, Canada aims to “engage constructively” with Beijing, while still challenging its approach in areas such as human rights and security. “We’re going to have to continue to be wide-eyed and clear about the threat that China poses and wants to pose to the stability of our democracies,” he said.  Trudeau will meet with Biden later Thursday, marking the US President’s first official overnight visit to the country since entering the White House more than two years ago. The trip is anticipated to underscore the neighbors’ close diplomatic, economic and security ties.  “Growing our economy, creating good jobs for people in a changing world, how we’re going to be holding off the rise of authoritarianism, defending our democracies, how we’re going to be continuing to step up on the fight against climate change …there’s so much that we can do together and so much greater impact that we have around the world when we do it together,” Trudeau said.  Trudeau, the longest-serving leader in the G7, has been an ally to Biden in providing military and financial assistance to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. At home, the US and Canada also share a number of domestic security concerns, from foreign election meddling to the handling of a suspected Chinese spy balloon over North America in recent months.  Canadian and US skies are jointly protected by the bilateral agency North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which shot down three airborne objects in February amid fears of Chinese spying. One was identified as a Chinese surveillance balloon, which Beijing described as a civilian airship that accidentally entered US airspace.  Both governments are also scrutinizing less tangible potential threats from overseas. Popular social media app TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese parent company, has recently been banned from government devices in both countries. And earlier this month, Trudeau said an independent report had confirmed Chinese election meddling attempts in Canada’s 2019 and 2021 elections – an accusation which Beijing has described as “total nonsense.”  Trudeau told Newton that he envisioned a range of ways of dealing with China’s growing power.  “One of the things we have to remember is China is the second largest economy in the world and continues to grow. We are going to have to – in some circumstances – engage constructively with China like we did around the conference on biodiversity that we hosted with them in Montreal,” he said, referring to the United Nations COP15 summit in December.  “There’s other places where we’re going to have to be stiff competition to China in terms of market access (and) in terms of investments in the Global South. We need to be able to show that the Western democracies are there to make those investments and they’re as competitive to China,” he said.  “But there are also areas in which we’re going to have to directly challenge China, whether it’s on human rights, whether it’s on security behaviors, whether it’s on cyber attacks or concerns like that. We’re going to have to continue to be wide-eyed and clear about the threat that China poses and wants to pose to the stability of our democracies.” In 2021, China and Canada ended a bitter standoff over nationals detained in each country; Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were released after being held in China for nearly three years on espionage charges, while Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was allowed to return to China after being arrested in Vancouver on a US warrant. China has consistently denied that the cases were in any way connected. A series of controversies involving China have also dogged Trudeau in recent months. In early March, the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, named for his father, said it would refund a major donation after local media reported that it had received $150,000 in 2016 from two wealthy Chinese businessmen to fund scholarships and leadership programs. The Foundation said in a statement that it does not accept any donation that “may have been sponsored by a foreign government.” In a separate incident, member of parliament Han Dong left Trudeau’s Liberal party after reports emerged in Canadian media that he had suggested to a Chinese diplomat that the federal Conservative Party would benefit politically if Beijing released the two Michaels. CNN is not able to independently verify those reports. Trudeau told Newton on Thursday that he learned of Dong’s meeting through media reports. Dong, who confirmed the meeting took place but denies the alleged comments, will now sit as an independent. “I want to assure Mr. Michael Spavor and Mr. Michael Kovrig and their families that I did nothing to cause them any harm. Like everyone in this House, I worked hard and advocated for their interest as a parliamentarian. The allegations made against me are as false as the ones made against you,” he said Wednesday night in an emotional statement in Canada’s parliament. Trudeau also teased a possible migration deal with the United States in the interview, saying that “we hopefully will be able to make to make an announcement to reassure Canadians and Americans that we continue to handle migration seriously.”  Growing numbers of migrants and asylum seekers at the US southern border have resulted in waves of migration northward. Canada, which ranks as the top country on Gallup’s Migrant Acceptance Index, saw record migration last year, which in turn bumped its population growth to unprecedented levels.  In late 2022, the Canadian government also announced that it aimed to bring in 1.5 million immigrants by 2025 to bolster the gap in its economy created by an aging population. But conservatives in Canada have criticized the migration surge – particularly through the unofficial border crossing Roxham Road, a remote street that connects the US and Canada.  Some asylum seekers have focused on that border crossing as one where they can request protection from Canada despite having passed through the United States – a strategy that they would not normally be able to use under the Safe Third Country Agreement.  Signed in 2002, the pact applies to people transiting through a country where they could have claimed asylum because it’s deemed safe. It means that anyone entering a land port of entry could be ineligible to make a claim and therefore be returned to the US. Because Roxham Road is not an official crossing, people who transit there can still request asylum in Canada.  “Canada is always willing to do more,” Trudeau told Newton. “We’re a country that has been built like the United States on welcoming people from around the world. We just need to make sure we’re doing it in responsible proper ways to continue to have our citizens positive towards immigration, as Canadians always are.”  Also expected on the two leaders’ agenda Thursday is Haiti, the Caribbean nation plagued with gang violence and political instability from which many recent migrants in North America originate.  Earlier this week, the United Nations reiterated its call to the international community to deploy a force to Haiti to restore peace to the Caribbean nation, where gang-led violence is “spiraling out of control.” But member states have so far have been reluctant to heed the call, amid deep skepticism among Haitians. Trudeau’s government too has stopped short of offering any military presence on the ground in Haiti, though it has sent Canadian surveillance aircraft and naval vessels to the country in addition to aid. The Prime Minister said other nations should step up sanctions on Haitian elites, whom he blamed for encouraging chaos in the country. “The simplest external solutions are not always the best way to help,” he told Newton of military intervention.

His appearance before the grand jury has the potential to make or break the special counsel’s investigation into the handling of classified records at Mar-a-Lago and possible obstruction of justice when the federal government tried to get the documents back. Corcoran has been told by the federal court he cannot withhold information any longer about communications he had with Trump, his client, leading up to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago last summer. He was also ordered earlier this week to turn over notes he had considered to be his written work as an attorney in the probe. Corcoran would have had a window into many of the moments where Trump and his team were responding to the federal government’s efforts to get classified documents back. Prosecutors have made clear in court proceedings that are still under seal that they believe Trump tried to use Corcoran to advance a crime. A Trump spokesperson criticized the recent developments, saying, “Prosecutors only attack lawyers when they have no case whatsoever.” When Corcoran first testified to the grand jury in January, he was asked about what happened in the lead up to the August search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. But he declined to answer, prompting the prosecutors to take the unusual step to fight in court to force him to respond. Prosecutors now want to ask Corcoran about his interactions with Trump regarding a May subpoena and subsequent search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. They also want to know about the statement Corcoran crafted in June 2022 – which claimed a “diligent search” had been conducted of boxes moved from the White House to Florida – and a June call between Trump and Corcoran that took place the same day the Trump Organization was subpoenaed for surveillance footage of Mar-a-Lago, according to a person familiar with the matter. The surveillance footage ultimately showed boxes being moved out of a storage room within the resort, which a witness later said happened at Trump’s direction. That June statement, which also said all classified documents had been returned, included the signature of attorney Christina Bobb, who added the caveat, “to the best of my knowledge.” Later that summer, the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago and found hundreds of government records, including classified material, raising questions about the lawyer’s attestation. Corcoran’s second visit to the grand jury Friday comes well into the year-long criminal investigation around the classified records Trump kept. Months ago other close advisers to Trump were brought in to testify, and more than two dozen aides and staff around Mar-a-Lago have been subpoenaed to the grand jury, CNN has reported. Even on Thursday, the grand jury investigating the Mar-a-Lago documents was pressing forward hearing from an unknown witness. Special counsel’s office prosecutors have been demanding others testify as well, now often unwilling to give deadline extensions, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe. Trump’s various legal entanglements in Florida, Georgia and New York have come increasingly into public view in recent days, especially regarding the case in Manhattan, where a grand jury is investigating Trump’s alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Trump has denied involvement while stirring anxieties of potential political violence by claiming his arrest is imminent and calling on his supporters to protest. Such language has drawn concerns from some Republicans, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who himself was the victim of political violence in 2017. There is “no place in America for political violence of any kind,” Scalise said Friday, after Trump warned of possible “death and destruction” if he is indicted. Scalise added: “I’ve been saying that for years and I think everybody ought to take that position.” This story has been updated with additional reporting.

ABC News first reported on his grand jury testimony. Parlatore organized searches for additional classified documents last year at Trump Tower, Trump’s property in Bedminster, Mar-a-Lago, an office in Palm Beach and a Florida storage unit. He testified before the grand jury as Trump’s team and the Justice Department were embroiled in a dispute in which the Justice Department unsuccessfully sought to hold Trump in contempt for failing to hand over all classified documents after receiving a subpoena in May 2022. Parlatore appeared before the grand jury to respond to a battery of questions about how subsequent document searches were conducted. He was not subpoenaed to appear. Parlatore said he had provided the government copies of reports his team wrote on each of the searches of Trump properties.

As the investigation comes closer to its end, prosecutors are considering the historic nature of prosecuting a former president, which would be an unprecedented action, sources tell CNN. Other sources say the district attorney’s office is taking a moment to regroup after the events of the past week. After Trump over the weekend predicted on his social media that he would be arrested on Tuesday, anticipation roared over the investigation and the prospect of an indictment. But then it seemed to ebb after the grand jury did not meet on Wednesday and convened to hear another matter on Thursday. In essence, the former president helped create the expectation he would be indicted, then he and fellow Republicans used it to score political points against Bragg and Democrats. Trump seized on the pause in grand jury action on Thursday to continue to rail against Bragg, claiming there was “total disarray in the Manhattan D.A.’s Office.” In an overnight social media post on Friday, Trump escalated his rhetoric and raised the possibility of “potential death & destruction” if he is indicted, with the former president continuing to assert “NO Crime has been committed.” Bragg is investigating Trump’s alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to keep silent about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair. Law enforcement officials are preparing for the possibility of a decision from the grand jury next week but are still waiting to hear from the district attorney’s office. The New York Police Department held a rehearsal on Wednesday for its posture if there are protests in downtown New York, although preparations are still underway, according to a law enforcement official. There haven’t been any sizable protests this week despite Trump’s calls, or any known credible threat. One law enforcement source familiar with security planning around the Manhattan DA’s Trump hush money case told CNN on Thursday that it is still unclear as to when, or if, an indictment could come. Coincidentally, the sequel to the film “Joker” is filming in the area of the Manhattan courthouse where the grand jury meets. It is expected there will be scenes that include protests and cars on fire, according to a source familiar with the planning. The district attorney’s office is trying to determine whether to call back Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to refute the testimony provided earlier this week by lawyer Robert Costello – or to call an additional witness to buttress their case before the grand jurors consider a vote on whether to indict the former president, one source familiar with the investigation said. Costello testified on Monday before the grand jury, at the request of Trump’s attorneys, in an effort to undercut the reliability of Cohen, a key witness for the prosecution. It’s unclear whether Costello’s testimony altered the district attorney’s strategy as he’s mulled whether to call an additional witness. “Up until this point, the grand jury had only heard the prosecution’s witnesses, under questioning by prosecutors, with no input from defense counsel or potential defendants,” said Elie Honig, a former prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst. “So Costello would have given the grand jury a defense perspective, for the first time.” Costello told CNN his appearance before the grand jury Monday was, at times, contentious. He said he was questioned by a prosecutor while seven other assistant district attorneys also sat inside the grand jury room. While grand jury proceedings are sealed, Costello claimed he challenged prosecutors about why he was only asked about six of the hundreds of documents he submitted and, at one point, he turned to the grand jury and told them they should demand to see all the documents. Costello says five or six jurors nodded in agreement with his statement. “Without a doubt my testimony had an impact on the grand jury. I told the truth about Michael Cohen. I did not try to embarrass the DA’s office or Alvin Bragg,” Costello said. Costello said he has not heard from the DA’s office since his appearance. Following Costello’s testimony, Cohen claimed in an MSNBC interview that Costello made “false statements” about him to the grand jury and tried “to muddy the water as best as he possibly can.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[13],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"Ukraine eyes an offensive around Bakhmut","text":["Russian forces are depleted in Bakhmut and a Ukrainian counter-offensive could soon be launched, one of Kyiv’s top generals has said, raising the prospect of an unlikely turnaround in the besieged city. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s land forces, said on his Telegram channel Thursday that “[Russians] are losing significant forces [in Bakhmut] and are running out of energy.” “Very soon, we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we did in the past near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliya and Kupyansk,” he said. His comments come days after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky made a surprise trip to the front lines of the Donetsk region, and will raise hopes in the West that Kyiv’s contentious decision to keep troops in Bakhmut will pay dividends.  A counter-offensive has seemed an unlikely prospect for several weeks, as forces from Russia’s Wagner mercenary group bombarded Bakhmut and edged closer toward seizing control of the city. But that effort has come at a considerable cost to manpower and resources, and now appears to have slowed. Russian troops have launched more than 200 strikes on the area in the past 24 hours alone but are losing hundreds of men each day in their efforts, the spokesman for the Eastern Grouping of the Armed Forces, Serhii Cherevatyi, said later on Thursday. CNN is unable to verify those figures. Cherevatyi said another area that was seeing intense fire was to the northeast of Bakhmut, on the front line running north from the town of Kreminna. Speaking on Ukrainian television Friday, Cherevatyi said that “It is not that [Wagner] are withdrawing, but that due to heavy losses they have to be reinforced by units of the regular army of the Russian Federation, primarily by airborne troops.” He added that Russian forces in the area are “making several dozen attacks every day. There were 32 firefights over the last day,” in and around Bakhmut. There were also air strikes launched by both fixed-wing planes and attack helicopters, he said, but added that “artillery is a much bigger factor of influence on military operations there than aviation.” On Thursday, the Ukrainian National Resistance Center – an official body – said that Wagner mercenaries had begun deporting residents of the Bakhmut suburbs they control. “Militants forcefully take local residents to captured areas of Luhansk region, where they are filtered. After that, they are deported to Perm (Russia) and other remote regions of the Russian Federation,” the Center said. “Locals are deported under the intention of evacuation. After that, they are assimilated in remote areas of the empire, because they are now dependent on the occupiers.” The Center’s claim could not be verified. The optimism of land forces commander Syrskyi reflected a Wednesday update from the the Ukrainian military’s General Staff, which said in a statement that while Bakhmut is still expected to see heavy fighting, Russia’s “offensive potential is decreasing” there. “The enemy keeps trying to take the city, losing a significant amount of manpower, weapons and military equipment,” it said on Wednesday. Western intelligence strikes a similar tone. “The tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank wrote in its Wednesday update on the conflict. But that shift may also indicate a change in Russia’s priorities. “There is a realistic possibility that the Russian assault on the town is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, partially because some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors,” the British Ministry of Defence said Wednesday. Zelensky handed out awards to troops defending Bakhmut during a morale-boosting trip on Wednesday. “It is an honor for me to support our warriors who are defending the country in the toughest frontline conditions,” he later said in his nightly address. The lengthy resistance of Ukrainian troops could yet vindicate his decision to ignore some Western calls to tactically retreat from Bakhmut as the Russian offensive closed in. “This is tactical for us,” Zelensky told CNN earlier this month, laying out his decision-making and insisting that Kyiv’s military brass was united in prolonging its defense of the city. “We understand that after Bakhmut they could go further. They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to Sloviansk, it would be open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,” he said. A city 20 kilometers west of Bakhmut is also being struck with increasing frequency by Russian missiles, Ukrainian authorities said Friday. Authorities said three people were killed in an overnight Russian missile attack on the city of Kostantynivka in Donetsk region.

About 75% of the full-time hourly workers covered under the deal currently get about $15 an hour, according to the unions. The employees do everything from perform as characters to staff restaurants and shops, drive buses, trams and monorails as well as work at front desks and perform hotel housekeeping duties. They would receive a retroactive pay increase to $16 an hour back to October of 2022, and see their current pay increase to $17 an hour upon ratification of the deal. It would go to a minimum of $18 an hour as of December 3. They would also get a raise of 50 cents an hour in December of 2024, and an additional $1 an hour in 2025 and 2026. The company’s previous offer would have given them only an initial $1 an hour raise, along with four subsequent raises of an additional $1 an hour over each year of the five-year contract. So Disney isn’t agreeing to pay significantly more than that previous offer over the course of the five-year contract, with raises totaling $5.50 an hour rather than $5 an hour. But the unions were able to get a much more front-loaded pay package in this tentative deal. About 96% of membership who voted on that previous offer rejected it, following the recommendation of their union leadership. “The company finally heard voices of the cast members,” Matt Hollis, the president of the Service Trades Council Union, the collection of unions that are negotiating with Disney management, said in an interview with CNN Business. “I can’t help but believe the overwhelming result of the previous vote played a role in reaching this agreement. I think an overwhelming majority of cast members will see this as a win.” The company said it was pleased to be able to reach the tentative agreement and hopeful that will be ratified. “Our cast members are central to Walt Disney World’s enduring magic,” said Jeff Vahle, president of Walt Disney World Resort in a statement. “Disney is proud to offer an industry-leading employment package that includes comprehensive benefits and affordable medical coverage, in addition to 100 percent paid tuition for higher education for hourly employees through the Disney Aspire program.” Disney recently announced plans to cut about 7,000 jobs across the company. But Hollis said the unions don’t believe the hourly workers covered by this contract will be affected by the layoffs. In fact, Disney has been struggling to fill some of the job openings it has at Disney World. The union has argued that the high cost of living and rapidly rising prices make living in central Florida unaffordable for many of the workers under the current wage structure. While the company’s media and entertainment division lost $10 million in the most recent fiscal quarter ending December 31, its parks, experiences and products division reported a $3 billion operating profit. Attendance at its domestic parks was up 11% from a year earlier, and the average visitor was spending 8% more. Hotel occupancy rose to 88% from 73% a year earlier. While the union had never scheduled a strike vote or threatened a strike, this was not a time that Disney wanted to risk bookings at the park by talk of a possible work stoppage. The vote to ratify the contract is set to be completed by next Wednesday evening.

While discussions have been ongoing for years, the sharp increase of people crossing into Canada from the US – some of whom are believed to have initially crossed the US southern border – had recently placed added urgency on talks. US President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are expected to announce the modifications to the agreement before Biden concludes his visit and travels back to the US, according to one Canadian official. Ahead of Biden’s visit to Canada, Trudeau faced blowback domestically over hundreds of migrants crossing Roxham Road, a remote street that connects Champlain, New York, with Hemmingford, Quebec. The so-called Safe Third Country Agreement, signed in 2002, applies to individuals who have transited through a country where they could’ve made an asylum claim because it’s deemed safe, as the name of the agreement implies. It’s in effect at ports of entry, and individuals entering at a land port of entry may be ineligible to make a claim and be returned to the US. But Roxham Road is not an official crossing, meaning that people who transit there could still seek protections in Canada even though they passed through the US. Crossings between ports of entry were not initially included in the agreement because of limitations to information sharing, experts say, prompting Canada to try to close that loophole now that those limitations have been lessened. Trudeau told CNN’s Paula Newton on Thursday that “there’s a lot of work being done,” but added that “hopefully we’ll be able to make an announcement to reassure Canadians and Americans that we continue to handle migration seriously” – an apparent nod to the deal. “Canada is always willing to do more,” Trudeau told Newton, when asked whether such an announcement would include taking some migrants directly from the US. “We’re a country that has been built by the United States and have been welcoming people from around the world. We just need to make sure we are doing it in responsible proper ways to continue to have our citizens positive towards Immigration as Canadians always are.” US authorities have started flying migrants crossing from Canada into the United States to Texas for processing and if eligible, expelling them to Mexico or their country of origin under a Covid-era border restriction, according to a Homeland Security official. US Border Patrol has recently seen a historic high number of migrant crossings in the northern region, prompting the agency to send additional authorities to the region to assist. The Swanton Sector, which covers some 24,000 square miles along the US-Canada border, has fewer personnel than sectors along the US southern border and has been overwhelmed by the increase in border crossings. “Swanton Sector Agents are seeing elevated levels of illegal entries from Canada. In just over 5 months, we have apprehended more individuals than the last three (3) Fiscal Years combined,” said Swanton Sector Chief Patrol Agent Robert N. Garcia in a tweet, calling it “unprecedented.” This story has been updated with additional details.

The “guided-missile destroyer USS Milius asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law,” a statement from 7th Fleet spokesperson Lt. jg. Luka Bakic said. The warship conducted what the US Navy calls a “freedom of navigation operation,” or FONOP, Bakic said, “challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan, and Vietnam.” All three claim the Paracels, known as the Xishas in China, a group of about 130 small atolls, the biggest of which are home to Chinese military bases. The US statement also said the Milius challenged China’s claim to “straight baselines enclosing the Paracels,” meaning Beijing’s claims to waters between the islands, even when those waters are outside the internationally recognized 12-nautical-mile limit from a coastline for territorial waters. China claims almost all of the vast South China Sea as part of its territorial waters, including many distant islands and inlets in the disputed body of water, many of which Beijing has militarized. Other claimants besides Taiwan and Vietnam include Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, which has seen a UN tribunal rule in its favor in a dispute with Beijing over islands in the Spratly group. But Beijing has rejected the UN ruling, and built up military bases on those disputed islands in the Spratlys – known as the Nansha Islands in China – as it has done in the Paracels. On Friday, China reacted angrily to the presence of the US warship near the islands it claims. “The actions of the U.S. military have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security and seriously violated international law,” Tan Kefei, spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, said in a statement. “The guided-missile destroyer USS Milius broke into China’s Xisha territorial waters again without the approval of the Chinese government, undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Tan said. On Thursday, Beijing said the Milius was driven away from the Paracels by People’s Liberation Army forces, a claim that was called “false” by the US 7th Fleet. Beijing has made similar claims after other FONOPs, which the US conducts regularly around the Paracels and the Spratlys to the south. The Paracels are located east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.  Beijing regularly makes statements that any US Navy operations in the South China Sea inflame tensions and show that Washington, and its partners who keep a naval presence in the waterway, are damaging the region’s security. The area around the Paracels was the site of a tense encounter between a Chinese warplane and US reconnaissance jet in February that was witnessed by a CNN crew. Then and now, Washington is consistent in its statements about its South China Sea operations. “The operations demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows – regardless of the location of excessive maritime claims and regardless of current events,” Friday’s statement, like many others before it, said. In recent years, the South China Sea has emerged as a major potential flashpoint in the Asia Pacific. Not only does the strategic waterway hold vast resources of fish, oil and gas, but about a third of global shipping passes through it – worth about $3.4 trillion in 2016, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) China Power Project. China also conducts regular military exercises in much of the South China Sea and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels in the disputed waters – which has frequently stoked tensions with other claimants.

The US incidence of tuberculosis, or TB, increased slightly last year after a substantial 20.2% decline in 2020 and a 9.8% increase in 2021, according to the data published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Thursday, just a day ahead of World Tuberculosis Day. “TB incidence increased during 2022, compared with that during 2020 and 2021,” CDC researchers wrote in the report. Now, the incidence “appears to be returning to prepandemic levels among U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born populations.”  Before the pandemic, the incidence of reported tuberculosis decreased gradually in the United States from 1993 through 2019, falling to 2.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 and then to 2.2 in 2020, CDC data showed. The researchers noted that during the pandemic, many tuberculosis diagnoses may have been missed, misdiagnosed or delayed. In 2021, tuberculosis incidence rebounded to 2.4 cases per 100,000 and increased even more to 2.5 in 2022, according to the CDC. Last year, 8,300 cases were reported in the United States, compared with 7,874 cases in 2021. American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander communities appear to be the most affected, according to the CDC, with incidence rates 10 times higher than among White people. A rise in cases has also been seen among young children and people who have newly arrived from outside the country. Compared with 2021, the largest increase in tuberculosis incidence last year was among children 4 and younger and people 15 to 24. Adults 65 and older were the only age group that had a decrease, the data showed.  Higher proportions of TB cases also are among people experiencing homelessness or living in correctional or long-term care facilities, according to the CDC. Washington state recently had its largest tuberculosis outbreak in 20 years. Another report published Thursday in the MMWR described how a total of 25 tuberculosis cases were identified among people incarcerated at two Washington prisons in 2021 and 2022. “An additional 244 resident-contacts and staff-member-contacts without known TB histories in five facilities received a diagnosis of latent TB infection,” the researchers wrote, meaning they were infected but had no symptoms. Between 2014 and 2020, no tuberculosis cases had been reported within the Washington prison system. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, usually in the lungs, that can cause coughing, chest pain and fever – characterized by coughing up blood or mucus. Tuberculosis disease is curable, often treated with a standardized course of drugs that usually includes antibacterial medicines. It can also be prevented with protocols such as screening, vaccination and making sure people who are infected finish their course of treatment. Each year, about 10 million people fall ill with the disease, even though it is preventable and curable, and about 1.5 million people die, making it “the world’s top infectious killer,” according to the World Health Organization. TB is one of the leading causes of death for people with HIV worldwide. There has also been a global rise in tuberculosis. “The Covid-19 pandemic and conflicts in many countries have severely disrupted services to prevent, detect and treat TB. As a result, WHO last year reported an increase in TB deaths for the first time in more than a decade,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus said Thursday. Tedros added that world leaders are scheduled to meet in New York in September to discuss the state of tuberculosis and efforts to end the global TB epidemic by 2030. “We believe that meeting should be a turning point in the fight against TB, if leaders make real and lasting commitments to invest in the response to TB,” he said. “Ending TB by 2030 is an extremely ambitious target.”  On Thursday, WHO released a “flagship initiative” document outlining the effort to fast-track progress toward ending  tuberculosis between 2023 and 2027. The initiative includes a call to action for nations and providers to accelerate the rollout of new WHO-recommended oral treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis, which the agency calls “a pressing public health concern.” “2023 is our chance to push forward the agenda towards ending TB,” Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO’s Global Tuberculosis Programme, said in a news release Thursday. “WHO is pressing for firm political commitment at the highest level, strong multisectoral collaboration including beyond health, and an effective accountability system. We need everyone – individuals, communities, societies, donors and governments – to do their part to end TB,” she said. “Together, yes, we can end TB.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[8],"topic_weights":[100],"title":"Utah governor signs bill requiring teens","text":["The governor of Utah signed a controversial bill on Thursday that will require minors to obtain the consent of a guardian before joining social media platforms, marking the most aggressive step yet by state or federal lawmakers to protect kids online. As part of the bill, called the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, social media platforms will have to conduct age verification for all Utah residents, ban all ads for minors and impose a curfew, making their sites off limits between the hours of 10:30 p.m. - 6:30 a.m. for anyone under the age of 18. The bill will also require social platforms to give parents access to their teens’ accounts. The legislation, which was introduced by Republican Sen. Michael McKell and passed by Republican Governor Spencer Cox, will go into effect on March 1, 2024. “When it comes down to it, [the bill] is about protecting our children,” McKell said in a statement to CNN, citing how depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation has “drastically increased” among teens in Utah and across the United states Slongside the growth of social media sites. “As a lawmaker and parent, I believe this bill is the best path forward to prevent our children from succumbing to the negative and sometimes life-threatening effects of social media.” The legislation comes after years of US lawmakers calling for new safeguards to protect teens online, amid concerns about social platforms leading younger users down harmful rabbit holes, enabling new forms of bullying and harassment and adding to what’s been described as a teen mental health crisis in the country. To date, however, no federal legislation has passed. Utah is the first of a broader list of states introducing similar proposals. In Connecticut and Ohio, for example, lawmakers are working to pass legislation that would require social media companies to get parent permission before users under age 16 can join. “We can assume more methods like the Utah bill could find their way into other states’ plans, especially if actions are not taken at the federal level,” said Michael Inouye, an analyst at ABI Research. “Eventually, if enough states implement similar or related legislation, we could see a more concerted effort at the federal level to codify these (likely) disparate state laws under a US-wide policy.” Industry experts and Big Tech companies have long urged the US government to introduce regulations that could help keep young social media users safe. But even before the bill’s passage, some had raised concerns about the impact of the legislation. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said Utah’s specific set of rules are “dangerous” when it comes to user privacy and added that the bill will make user data less secure, internet access less private and infringe upon younger users’ basic rights. “Social media provides a lifeline for many young people, in addition to community, education, and conversation,” said Jason Kelley, director of activism at the EFF. “They use it in part because it can be private … The law, which would limit social media access and require parental consent and monitoring for minors, will incalculably harm the ability of young people to protect their privacy and deter them from exercising their rights.” Lucy Ivey, an 18-year-old TikTok influencer who attends Utah Valley University, agreed, saying some of her friends in the LGBTQ community may face challenges with the change. “My worry with this bill is that it will take away privacy from teenagers, and a lot of kids don’t have good relationships with their parents or don’t have a reliable guardian that would be needed to get access to social media,” she told CNN. “I think about my LGBTQ friends; some who have had a hard time with their parents because of their sexuality or identity, and they could be losing an important place where they can be themselves, and be seen and heard.” Ivey, who launched a publication called Our Era at age 15 and amplified its content on TikTok, said she’s also concerned about how the bill will impact content creators like herself. (If a legal guardian disapproves of a teens’ online activity or digital presence, those individuals may have to put their accounts on hold until they are 18 years old.) “With a new law like this, they may now be intimidated and discouraged by the legal hoops required to use social media out of fear of authority or their parents, or fear of losing their privacy at a time when teens are figuring out who they are,” Ivey said. Facebook-parent Meta told CNN it has the same goals as parents and policymakers, but the company said it also wants young people to have safe, positive experiences online and keep its platforms accessible. Antigone Davis, the global head of safety for Meta, said the company will “continue to work closely with experts, policymakers and parents on these important issues.” Representatives for TikTok and Snap did not respond to a request for comment. Given that the bill is unprecedented, it’s unclear how exactly the social media companies will adapt. For example, the legislation calls for platforms to turn off algorithms for “suggested content.” This particular guideline may help keep teens from falling down rabbit holes toward potentially harmful content, but it could present new issues, too. It might mean the company would no longer have the oversight and control over downranking problematic content that may show up in a user’s feed. Some of the bill’s guidelines may also be difficult to enforce. Inouye said minors could “steal” identities – such as from family members who don’t use social media –  to create accounts that they can access and use without oversight. VPNs could also complicate matching IP addresses to the states of the users, he said. But even if legislative steps from Utah and other states prove to be flawed, Inouye says “these early efforts are at minimum bringing attention to these issues.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[2,1,0,12],"topic_weights":[57,28,7,7],"title":"Visitors will be able to walk on Westmin","text":["Those who want to follow in the footsteps of King Charles III will get the chance this summer – but they’ll have to take off their shoes. Visitors to London’s Westminster Abbey will be invited to walk on the church’s historic “Cosmati” pavement – the spot where Charles’ newly restored coronation chair will be placed for his coronation on May 6 – as long as they strip down to their socks to protect the floor. The mosaic, a colorful and highly decorative work composed of marble, stone, glass and metal, is the best surviving example of the inlay stonework known as Cosmati outside of Italy, according to the abbey. Groups of up to 10 visitors at a time will be allowed to walk on the floor on select days between May 15 and July 29, the abbey said on its website, “with everyone asked to remove their shoes to help protect its surface.” The flooring is positioned in front of the abbey’s High Altar and has been the scene of English coronations since it was commissioned by Henry III and completed in 1268. However, the pavement itself may not be familiar to many: During the coronations of previous monarchs, including Elizabeth II in 1953 and George VI in 1937, it was covered with a carpet. Charles, 74, became Britain’s King last year following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. According to Buckingham Palace, his coronation on May 6 will be a more modern affair than previous ones and will “look towards the future.”  The palace added that the occasion will still be “rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry.” The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will conduct the ceremony, which will see Charles crowned alongside his wife, Camilla, the Queen Consort.

Generally, home buyers can anticipate mortgage rates to move down through the rest of this year as the banking crisis drags on, which could cool down inflation. But there are bound to be some bumps along the way. Here’s why rates have been bouncing around and where they could end up. After steadily rising last year as a result of the Federal Reserve’s historic campaign to rein in inflation, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage topped out at 7.08% in November, according to Freddie Mac. Then, with economic data suggesting inflation was retreating, the average rate drifted down through January. But a raft of robust economic reports in February brought concerns that inflation was not cooling as quickly or as much as many had hoped. As a result, after falling to 6.09%, average mortgage rates climbed back up, rising half a percentage point over the month. Then in March banks began collapsing. That sent rates falling again. Neither the actions of the Federal Reserve nor the bank failures directly impact mortgage rates. But rates are indirectly impacted by actions that the Fed takes or is expected to take, as well as the health of the broader financial system and any uncertainty that may be percolating. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced it would raise interest rates by a quarter point as it attempts to fight stubbornly high inflation while taking into account recent risks to financial stability. While the bank failures made the Fed’s work more complicated, analysts have said that, if contained, the banking meltdown may have actually done some work for the Fed, by bringing down prices without raising interest rates. To that point, the Fed suggested on Wednesday that it may be at the end of its rate hike cycle. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed’s actions, what the Fed actually does and investors’ reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. Following the Fed’s announcement on Wednesday, bond yields — and the mortgage rates that usually follow them — fell. But the relationship between mortgage rates and Treasurys has weakened slightly in recent weeks, said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. “The secondary mortgage market may react to speculation that more financial entities may need to sell their long-term investments, like mortgage backed securities, to get more liquidity today,” he said. Even as Treasurys decline, he said, tighter credit conditions as a result of bank failures will likely limit any dramatic plunging of mortgage rates. “This could restrict mortgage lenders’ access to funding sources, resulting in higher rates than Treasuries would otherwise indicate,” Divounguy said. “For borrowers, lending standards were already quite strict, and tighter conditions may make it more difficult for some home shoppers to secure funding. In turn, for home sellers, the time it takes to sell could increase as buyers hesitate.” Inflation is still quite high, but it is slowing and analysts are anticipating a much slower economy over the next few quarters — which should further bring down inflation. This is good for mortgage borrowers, who can expect to see rates retreating through this year, said Mike Fratantoni, Mortgage Bankers Association senior vice president and chief economist. “Homebuyers in 2023 have shown themselves to be quite sensitive to any changes in mortgage rates,” Fratantoni said. The MBA forecasts that mortgage rates are likely to trend down over the course of this year, with the 30-year fixed rate falling to around 5.3% by the end of the year. “The housing market was the first sector to slow as the result of tighter monetary policy and should be the first to benefit as policymakers slow — and ultimately stop — hiking rates,” said Fratantoni.  In second half of the year, the inflation picture is expected to improve, leading to mortgage rates that are more stable. “Expectations for slower economic growth or even a recession should bring inflation down and help mortgage rates decline,” said Divounguy. That’s good news for home buyers since it improves affordability, bringing down the cost to finance a home. It also benefits sellers, since it reduces the intensity of an interest-rate lock-in. Lower rates could also convince more homeowners to list their home for sale. With the inventory of homes for sale near historic lows, this would add badly needed inventory to an extremely limited pool. “Mortgage rates are steering both supply and demand in today’s costly environment,” said Divounguy. “Home sales picked up in January when rates were relatively low, then slacked off as they ramped back up.” But with cooling inflation comes a higher risk of job losses, which is typically bad for the housing market. “Of course, much uncertainty surrounding the state of inflation and this still-evolving banking turmoil remains,” said Divounguy. In his remarks on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said estimates of how much the recent banking developments could slow the economy amounted to “guesswork, almost, at this point.” But regardless of the tack the economy and banking concerns take, their impact will quickly be seen in mortgage rates. “Evidence — in either direction — of spillovers into the broader economy or accelerating inflation would likely cause another policy shift, which would materialize in mortgage rates,” said Divounguy.

So far, the labor market has stayed white hot, with unemployment hovering at a half-century low. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s acknowledgment on Wednesday that the banking sector meltdown could lead to “tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes” has critics reminding him of the human impact of that “Fedspeak:” Millions of people out of work. The Fed’s latest economic projections, released on Wednesday, were largely in line with those from its last forecast, in December. In fact, the unemployment picture even grew a tinge less gloomy, with an estimated 2023 jobless rate of 4.5% instead of 4.6%.  Assuming no change in the labor force, going from the current unemployment rate of 3.6% to 4.5% would mean 1.5 million more people would be unemployed by the end of the year, according to the Fed’s projections. While the Fed’s own estimates hint at some sort of stability, even the head of the central bank is quick to note that’s far from the case. “It’s a highly uncertain estimate,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday. And, economists say, that uncertainty is heightened, given the banking turmoil of the past two weeks. The Fed now is facing a “trilemma” of re-establishing price stability, minimizing unemployment and restoring financial stability, said Joe Brusuelas, RSM US chief economist. And the probability is low that the Fed will be able to bring down inflation without causing a recession, preventing further consolidation in the banking sector or increasing unemployment, he said. “We are in a situation with inflation elevated and now a banking crisis on top of that,” Brusuelas told CNN. “The Fed’s attempt to strike a delicate balance between price stability, employment and financial stability will require something to give. And that something is going to be right around 1.5 million jobs, if the Fed’s forecast is prescient for the [4.5%] unemployment rate.” Brusuelas currently projects a 5.1% unemployment rate, which would be consistent with 2.5 million jobs lost, 3% inflation and a potential recession. “I think that the Fed’s going to move toward an above 5% unemployment rate forecast, either in June or by September,” he said. “We were 3.4% two months ago. That’s non-trivial.” The quick escalation of a jobless rate to that level or even the Fed’s 4.5% has sparked concern and criticism, most notably from Senator Elizabeth Warren. Earlier this month, the Democratic congresswoman from Massachusetts (and frequent Powell critic) pressed Powell about American jobs sacrificed for the Fed’s goals.  On Wednesday, Warren reiterated some of her concerns, saying Powell’s actions present a “danger” to the economy. Powell has frequently countered that persistently high inflation remains a far more dangerous prospect. “The costs of bringing it down, there are real costs to bring it down to 2%,” he said Wednesday. “But the costs of failing are much higher.” Then there’s also the scenario that the Fed could get an assist from an unlikely bedfellow — the banking crisis. “The tightening of lending standards and actual lending that’s going to ensue on the backside of this will cool the economy in a significant way, and that might,” Brusuelas said, emphasizing the importance of the word ‘might,’ “avoid larger job losses than what our research indicated prior to the onset of the banking crisis. But we’ll have to see. Banking crises are profoundly non-linear events, and they’re going to impact the different industrial systems in uniquely different ways.” The actions taken by the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Treasury appear to have contained the crisis, said Eugenio Alemán, chief economist with Raymond James. “I think that the worst is over; the Federal Reserve has been very, very tough and very, very clear that they will backstop any further run against the banking system or banking institutions,” he said. “So I think that is on the mend.” Now, the question is how bad was this for expectations, or how consumers and businesses feel about the economy, he said. Business cycles, too, can evolve in non-linear fashion, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “Many of the commentators are right in assessing that the possibility of just a mild slowdown is perhaps overestimated, is perhaps seen as too likely,” he said. “And once we start to see sentiment shift, either in the business sector or in the consumer sector, that can feed off of itself — that can lead to further weakness, which could lead to a stronger rise in the unemployment rate and weaker economic conditions.”  However, he added, there are still too many potential uncertain factors in the economy to really know how this might develop. “I think we will see slower economic activity. I do think the odds of a recession have increased in the wake of this banking sector crisis,” he said. “And in particular, I think that we should be paying very close attention to credit conditions.” Prior to this recent episode, about half of banks had already tightened credit standards for commercial and industrial loans, Daco said, adding he estimates that to grow to 75% to 80%. “Maybe even higher,” he said. “That is going to constrain business investment, that is going to constrain hiring, and that is going to constrain consumer spending. And so that will lead to weaker economic activity going forward.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[10,8,2,9],"topic_weights":[38,25,19,17],"title":"Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates clash","text":["The two candidates battling for a seat on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court clashed Tuesday over the state’s 1849 abortion ban in their lone debate, underscoring the high stakes of an election that could decide the issue in one of the nation’s most important swing states. Former Justice Daniel Kelly, a conservative, and liberal opponent Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasiewicz will square off April 4 in an election that will decide the balance of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. In a state where control is split between a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature, the high court could decide the outcome of legal battles over the state’s abortion laws, its legislative maps and more. The debate – the only one scheduled between Protasiewicz and Kelly – took place on the same day Wisconsin voters began casting early ballots in person. It’s the nation’s most expensive judicial contest on record, with about $30 million already spent on advertising and counting, as there are two weeks remaining in the campaign. Wisconsin is one of 14 states in the country that directly elects Supreme Court justice in this manner. Protasiewicz focused her attacks on Kelly on abortion, with the state’s 1849 ban on nearly all abortions currently being challenged in court and likely to land before the state Supreme Court. “If my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty, that 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books. I can tell you that,” Protasiewicz said in Tuesday’s debate. She said she is “making no promises” on how she would rule on the 1849 abortion law. But she also noted her personal support for abortion rights, as well as endorsements from pro-abortion rights groups. And she pointed to Kelly’s endorsement by Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion rights. Kelly shot back that Protasiewicz’s comments are “absolutely not true.” “You don’t know what I’m thinking about that abortion ban,” he said. “You have no idea. These things you do not know.” The debate took place before a crowd of about 100 people who were seated in an auditorium at the offices of the State Bar of Wisconsin in Madison. The candidates answered questions from a panel of three Wisconsin reporters as the audience watched in silence. The rhetoric grew increasingly bitter and testy, particularly on the topics of abortion, redistricting and criminal sentencing, with the two rivals standing several feet apart on a small stage. The differences that have been aired in a multi-million television ad campaign came alive. Kelly looked directly at his opponent and repeatedly raised pointed questions about her integrity, saying at one point: “This seems to be a pattern for you, Janet, telling lies about me.” He called her by her first name, Janet, rather than judge. Protasiewic only occasionally looked toward her challenger, but pushed back against an allegation that she is soft on crime: “I have worked very hard to keep our community safe, each and every day I’m on the bench.” Kelly accused Protasiewicz of handing down light sentences to violent offenders. He cited the case of Anton Veasley, who in 2021 was convicted of child enticement and third degree sexual assault and was released after Protasiewicz stayed his five-year prison sentence with four years of probation, giving him credit for 417 days he’d already spent in jail. “We look at the sentencing she has composed and the reasoning she used to reach those conclusions, and that’s just irresponsible to allow dangerous convicted criminals back out so easily with no repercussions into the communities they just got done victimizing,” Kelly said. Protasiewicz acknowledged that “hindsight is 20/20.” But she said Kelly was mischaracterizing her record. “I have sentenced thousands of people. And it’s interesting that a handful of cases have been cherry-picked and selected and twisted, and insufficient facts have been provided to the electorate,” she said.

The announced regulations, which come into force on March 31, prohibit athletes who have gone through what WA called “male puberty” from participating in female world rankings competitions. WA said the exclusion would apply to “male-to-female transgender athletes who have been through male puberty.” “Decisions are always difficult when they involve conflicting needs and rights between different groups, but we continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations,” World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said in a statement. “We will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage which will inevitably develop over the coming years. As more evidence becomes available, we will review our position, but we believe the integrity of the female category in athletics is paramount.”  Coe said the decision came after deliberation with groups including World Athletics member federations, the Global Athletics Coaches Academy and Athletes’ Commission and the IOC, as well as representative transgender and human rights groups. He explained that World Athletics – the global governing body for track and field – would set up a working group to evaluate the issue of transgender inclusion over the next 12 months. “We’re not saying no forever,” he said. However, some pro-LGBTQ rights group have criticized the decision as discriminatory. “We are beyond devastated to see World Athletics succumbing to political pressure instead of core principles of inclusion, fairness and non-discrimination for transgender athletes and athletes with intersex variations,” said Hudson Taylor, founder and executive director of advocacy group Athlete Ally. Taylor added that he believes the new regulations “do nothing to address what we know to be the actual, proven threats to women’s sports: unequal pay, rampant sexual abuse and harassment, lack of women in leadership and inequities in resources for women athletes.” Meanwhile, Stonewall – a gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender rights charity in the United Kingdom – called the new WA rules excluding transgender women in upcoming events “disappointing.” “It is so disappointing to see World Athletics announce a unilateral ban on trans women in track and field events,” Stonewall said in a statement. “Their own statement recognises that there are no trans women competing at an international level and that they have no specific evidence to justify the ban. We stand with trans people who now have the door closed on their chance to compete in athletic sports at an international level.” In recent years, some opponents of trans women and girls’ participation in sport have turned the issue into a political flashpoint. In January, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the NCAA Convention in San Antonio to protest the inclusion of transgender women athletes in women’s college sports. Advocates of banning transgender women from women’s sport have argued that transgender women have a physical advantage over cisgender women in sports. But the mainstream science does not support that conclusion. A 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” on trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say the bans add to the discrimination trans people face.  Debate in the scientific community about whether androgenic hormones like testosterone serve as useful markers of athletic advantage remains ongoing. A World Athletics document obtained by CNN earlier this year states that trans women “retain an advantage in muscle mass, volume, and strength over cis women” after 12 months of gender affirming hormone therapy, while acknowledging that there is “limited existing experimental data” on the matter. In Thursday’s statement, World Athletics said: “It became apparent that there was little support within the sport for the option that was first presented to stakeholders, which required transgender athletes to maintain their testosterone levels below 2.5nmol/L for 24 months to be eligible to compete internationally in the female category.” See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]},{"top_topics_ids":[3,4],"topic_weights":[88,11],"title":"Zebra on the loose gives zookeepers the ","text":["A male zebra broke loose in South Korea’s capital on Thursday, trotting down busy roads and back alleys for hours before being tranquilized and returned to a zoo. Videos on social media showed 3-year-old Sero galloping through the Gwangjin district of Seoul amid heavy traffic, strolling down narrow alleys in residential neighborhoods, and passing zebra crossings as it scuttled around the city. Firefighters dispatched to the scene later herded the mammal to an alley, where it was tranquilized and brought back to the Children’s Grand Park, its home in the east of Seoul. According to the Gwangjin-gu fire station, officers received the first report at 3:43 p.m. about a zebra roaming free around the precinct. As a team of fire officers drove to the reported location, they spotted the zebra running in the opposite direction, prompting them to give chase, an official from the station told CNN. The officers blocked its escape route from a back alley with safety fences, fire trucks and police cars to wait for zoo officials to arrive. He said fire officers refrained from using animal anesthetic at the request of the zoo. A team dispatched by the zoo arrived about half an hour later to administer seven shots of muscle relaxant that eventually calmed the zebra down. Officers loaded Sero onto the vehicle bound for the zoo at around 6:00 p.m., ending its rare excursion. Both Sero’s parents died of illness last year, and since then he’s been displaying rebellious behaviors, Kim Jae-yun, an official at the zoo, told CNN. One time, he tried to pick a fight with a kangaroo next door, he said. In 2005, six elephants also escaped from the same park, charging into restaurants and a school, leaving one woman injured. The zoo is home to almost 3,000 animals made up of 350 species ranging from lions and giraffes to dolphins and exotic birds, according to its website. See Full Web Article"],"meta":[]}]}
