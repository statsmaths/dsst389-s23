## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. You may also have to hit the broom in
the upper right-hand corner of the window. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("../funs/funs.R")
source("../funs/funs_custom.R")
```

I have set the options `message=FALSE` and `echo=FALSE` to avoid cluttering
your solutions with all the output from this code.

## Reading the Data

Today we are going to look at a dataset of short texts taken from a set of 5
British authors:

```{r, message = FALSE}
docs <- read_csv("../data/stylo_uk.csv")
anno <- read_csv("../data/stylo_uk_token.csv.gz")
```

The prediction task is to determine the identity of the author based on the
text.

## Questions

### Baseline Elastic Net

Start by fitting an elastic net model with all of the default parameters. We
will need this several different times, so save the model with a unique name
such as `model_enet`:

```{r, question-01}

```

Compute the error rate of the elastic net model:

```{r, question-02}

```

### Baseline Gradient Boosted Trees

Now, fit a gradient boosted tree model using the default parameters:

```{r, question-03}

```

Compute the error rate of this model:

```{r, question-04}

```

Note that this model is not particularly good. The problem is that we need
a significantly larger set of trees. Create a new gradient boosted tree model
using 1000 trees:

```{r, question-05}

```

Compute the error rate now:

```{r, question-06}

```

How does the error rate compare to the elastic net model? Make sure to look at
both the training and validation results.

### Variable Importance

Now, look at the coefficients for the elastic net model. There are a lot, so
you may want to limit the lambda number to something around 30.

```{r, question-07}

```

And, for comparison, look at the importance scores for the gradient boosted
trees:

```{r, question-08}

```

How do the two lists compare to one another? Is there a lot of overlap? Is there
any particular pattern to the differences?

### Comparison of POS grams

Finally, fit an elastic net model using the variable "xpos" to create the
features. [Note: Not the n-grams; the tags themselves].

```{r, question-09}

```

Compute the error rate for the elastic net model:

```{r, question-10}

```

And look at the strongest coefficients:

```{r, question-11}

```

Now, fit a gradient boosted tree model using the variable "xpos" to create the
features. Use 1000 trees and set eta equal to 0.2 and use 300 trees.

```{r, question-12}

```

Compute the error rate of the gbm model and compate to the elastic net model
above. You should see that this model work better. Any idea why the trees are
better at this model?

```{r, question-13}

```

As a last step, look at the most important variables from the GBM model.

```{r, question-14}

```

How do the top terms compare to the elastic net model?
