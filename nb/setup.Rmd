## Setup

This notebook installs all of the packaged needed for the other notebooks.
Click the two green play buttons to start the installation.

```{r}
install.packages(
  pkgs = c(
    "tidyverse", "ggrepel", "jsonlite", "lubridate", "readxl", 
    "xml2", "lwgeom", "remotes", "knitr", "rmarkdown",
    "cleanNLP", "FNN", "glmnet", "irlba", "tidyr", "topicmodels",
    "umap", "xgboost", "clipr", "roxygen2", "tokenizers", "udpipe"
  ),
  dependencies = TRUE,
  type = "binary"
)
```

There may be some red text that prints out, but you should not need to worry
unless the screen says the word "Error". As a second step, you should install
our class-specific package with the following:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("statsmaths/dsst")
```
