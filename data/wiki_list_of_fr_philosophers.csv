Peter Abelard,"Peter Abelard was a medieval French scholastic philosopher leading logician theologian poet composer and musician.

In philosophy he is celebrated for his logical solution to the problem of universals via nominalism and conceptualism and his pioneering of intent in ethics. Often referred to as the Descartes of the twelfth century he is considered a forerunner of Rousseau Kant and Spinoza. He is sometimes credited as a chief forerunner of modern empiricism.

In history and popular culture he is best known for his passionate and tragic love affair and intense philosophical exchange with his brilliant student and eventual wife Héloïse dArgenteuil. He was a defender of women and of their education. After having sent Héloïse to a convent in Brittany to protect her from her abusive uncle who did not want her to pursue this forbidden love he was castrated by men sent by this uncle. Still considering herself as his spouse even though both retired to monasteries after this event Héloïse publicly defended him when his doctrine was condemned by Pope Innocent II and Abelard was therefore considered at that time as a heretic. Among these opinions Abelard professed the innocence of a woman who commits a sin out of love.

In Catholic theology he is best known for his development of the concept of limbo and his introduction of the moral influence theory of atonement. He is considered to be the most significant forerunner of the modern self-reflective autobiographer. He paved the way and set the tone for later epistolary novels and celebrity tell-alls with his publicly distributed letter The History of My Calamities and public correspondence. 

In law Abelard stressed that because the subjective intention determines the moral value of human action the legal consequence of an action is related to the person that commits it and not merely to the action. With this doctrine Abelard created in the Middle Ages the idea of the individual subject central to modern law. This eventually gave to School of Notre-Dame de Paris a recognition for its expertise in the area of Law .

Abelard originally called Pierre le Pallet was born c. in Le Pallet about 10 miles east of Nantes in the Duchy of Brittany the eldest son of a minor noble French family. As a boy he learned quickly. His father a knight called Berenger encouraged Abelard to study the liberal arts wherein he excelled at the art of dialectic . Instead of entering a military career as his father had done Abelard became an academic. 

During his early academic pursuits Abelard wandered throughout France debating and learning so as he became such a one as the Peripatetics. He first studied in the Loire area where the nominalist Roscellinus of Compiègne who had been accused of heresy by Anselm was his teacher during this period.

Around 1100 Abelards travels brought him to Paris. Around this time he changed his surname to Abelard sometimes written Abailard or Abaelardus. The etymological root of Abelard could be the Middle French abilite the Hebrew name AbelHabal the English apple or the Latin ballare . The name is jokingly referenced as relating to lard as in excessive learning in a secondary anecdote referencing Adelard of Bath and Peter Abelard .

In the great cathedral school of Notre-Dame de Paris he studied under Paris archdeacon and Notre-Dame master William of Champeaux later bishop of Chalons a disciple of Anselm of Laon a leading proponent of philosophical realism. Retrospectively Abelard portrays William as having turned from approval to hostility when Abelard proved soon able to defeat his master in argument. This resulted in a long duel that eventually ended in the downfall of the theory of realism which was replaced by Abelards theory of conceptualism nominalism. While Abelards thought was closer to Williams thought than this account might suggest William thought Abelard was too arrogant. It was during this time that Abelard would provoke quarrels with both William and Roscellinus.

Against opposition from the metropolitan teacher Abelard set up his own school first at Melun a favoured royal residence then around 11024 for more direct competition he moved to Corbeil nearer Paris. His teaching was notably successful but the stress taxed his constitution leading to a nervous breakdown and a trip home to Brittany for several years of recovery.

On his return after 1108 he found William lecturing at the hermitage of Saint-Victor just outside the Île de la Cité and there they once again became rivals with Abelard challenging William over his theory of universals. Abelard was once more victorious and Abelard was almost able to attain the position of master at Notre Dame. For a short time however William was able to prevent Abelard from lecturing in Paris. Abelard accordingly was forced to resume his school at Melun which he was then able to move from c. to Paris itself on the heights of Montagne Sainte-Geneviève overlooking Notre-Dame.

From his success in dialectic he next turned to theology and in 1113 moved to Laon to attend the lectures of Anselm on Biblical exegesis and Christian doctrine. Unimpressed by Anselms teaching Abelard began to offer his own lectures on the book of Ezekiel. Anselm forbade him to continue this teaching. Abelard returned to Paris where in around 1115 he became master of the cathedral school of Notre-Dame and a canon of Sens .

Héloïse dArgenteuil lived within the precincts of Notre-Dame under the care of her uncle the secular canon Fulbert. She was famous as the most well-educated and intelligent woman in Paris renowned for her knowledge of classical letters including not only Latin but also Greek and Hebrew.

At the time Heloise met Abelard he was surrounded by crowds supposedly thousands of students drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils and entertained with universal admiration he came to think of himself as the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science he claimed to have lived a very straight and narrow life enlivened only by philosophical debate now at the height of his fame he encountered romance.

Upon deciding to pursue Héloïse Abelard sought a place in Fulberts house and by in 1115 or 1116 began an affair. While in his autobiography he describes the relationship as a seduction Heloises letters contradict this and instead depict a relationship of equals kindled by mutual attraction. Abelard boasted of his conquest using example phrases in his teaching such as Peter loves his girl and writing popular poems and songs of his love that spread throughout the country. Once Fulbert found out he separated them but they continued to meet in secret. Héloïse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard to be looked after by his family in Brittany where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the scientific instrument.

To appease Fulbert Abelard proposed a marriage. Héloïse initially opposed marriage but to appease her worries about Abelards career prospects as a married philosopher the couple were married in secret. To avoid suspicion of involvement with Abelard Heloise continued to stay at the house of her uncle. When Fulbert publicly disclosed the marriage Héloïse vehemently denied it arousing Fulberts wrath and abuse. Abelard rescued her by sending her to the convent at Argenteuil where she had been brought up to protect her from her uncle. Héloïse dressed as a nun and shared the nuns life though she was not consecrated.

Fulbert infuriated that Heloise had been taken from his house and possibly believing that Abelard had disposed of her at Argenteuil in order to be rid of her arranged for a band of men to break into Abelards room one night and castrate him. In legal retribution for this vigilante attack members of the band were punished and Fulbert scorned by the public took temporary leave of his canon duties .

In shame of his injuries Abelard retired permanently as a Notre Dame canon with any career as a priest or ambitions for higher office in the church shattered by his loss of manhood. He effectively hid himself as a monk at the monastery of St. Denis near Paris avoiding the questions of his horrified public. Roscellinus and Fulk of Deuil ridiculed and belittled Abelard for being castrated.

Upon joining the monastery at St. Denis Abelard insisted that Héloïse take vows as a nun . Héloïse protested her separation from Abelard sending numerous letters re-initiating their friendship and demanding answers to theological questions concerning her new vocation.

Shortly after the birth of their child Astrolabe Heloise and Abelard were both cloistered. Their son was thus brought up by Abelards sister Denise at Abelards childhood home in Le Pallet. His name derives from the astrolabe a Persian astronomical instrument said to elegantly model the universe and which was popularized in France by Adelard. He is mentioned in Abelards poem to his son the Carmen Astralabium and by Abelards protector Peter the Venerable of Cluny who wrote to Héloise I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe who is also ours for your sake. 

Now in his early forties Abelard sought to bury himself as a monk of the Abbey of Saint-Denis with his woes out of sight. Finding no respite in the cloister and having gradually turned again to study he gave in to urgent entreaties and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures now framed in a devotional spirit and with lectures on theology as well as his previous lectures on logic were once again heard by crowds of students and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and in his view inconsistent writings of the leaders of the church as his basis he wrote Sic et Non .

No sooner had he published his theological lectures than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the Trinitarian dogma. Two pupils of Anselm of Laon Alberich of Reims and Lotulf of Lombardy instigated proceedings against Abelard charging him with the heresy of Sabellius in a provincial synod held at Soissons in 1121. They obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching and Abelard was made to burn the Theologia himself. He was then sentenced to perpetual confinement in a monastery other than his own but it seems to have been agreed in advance that this sentence would be revoked almost immediately because after a few days in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons Abelard returned to St. Denis.

Life in his own monastery proved no more congenial than before. For this Abelard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke he cited Bede to prove that the believed founder of the monastery of St. Denis Dionysius the Areopagite had been Bishop of Corinth while the other monks relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution Abelard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of Eusebius of Caesareas Historia Ecclesiastica and St. Jerome according to whom Dionysius Bishop of Corinth was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey; although in deference to Bede he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Adam accused him of insulting both the monastery and the Kingdom of France ; life in the monastery grew intolerable for Abelard and he was finally allowed to leave.

Abelard initially lodged at St. Ayoul of Provins where the prior was a friend. Then after the death of Abbot Adam in March 1122 Abelard was able to gain permission from the new abbot Suger to live in whatever solitary place he wished. In a deserted place near Nogent-sur-Seine in Champagne he built a cabin of stubble and reeds and a simple oratory dedicated to the Trinity and became a hermit. When his retreat became known students flocked from Paris and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. He began to teach again there. The oratory was rebuilt in wood and stone and rededicated as the Oratory of the Paraclete.

Lack of success at St. Gildas made Abelard decide to take up public teaching again . It is not entirely certain what he then did but given that John of Salisbury heard Abelard lecture on dialectic in 1136 it is presumed that he returned to Paris and resumed teaching on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. His lectures were dominated by logic at least until 1136 when he produced further drafts of his Theologia in which he analyzed the sources of belief in the Trinity and praised the pagan philosophers of classical antiquity for their virtues and for their discovery by the use of reason of many fundamental aspects of Christian revelation.

In 1128 Abbot Suger claimed that the convent at Argenteuil where Héloïse was prioress belonged to his abbey of St Denis. In 1129 he gained possession and he made no provision for the nuns. When Abelard heard he transferred Paraclete and its lands to Héloïse and her remaining nuns making her abbess. He provided the new community with a rule and with a justification of the nuns way of life; in this he emphasized the virtue of literary study. He also provided books of hymns he had composed and in the early 1130s he and Héloïse composed a collection of their own love letters and religious correspondence containing amongst other notable pieces Abelards most famous letter containing his autobiography Historia Calamitatum . This moved Héloïse to write her first Letter; the first being followed by the two other Letters in which she finally accepted the part of resignation which now as a brother to a sister Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140 Abelard published his masterpiece Ethica or Scito te ipsum where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not what a man will be judged for but intentions. During this period he also wrote Dialogus inter Philosophum Judaeum et Christianum and also Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos a commentary on St. Pauls epistle to the Romans where he expands on the meaning of Christs life.

After 1136 it is not clear whether Abelard had stopped teaching or whether he perhaps continued with all except his lectures on logic until as late as 1141. Whatever the exact timing a process was instigated by William of St. Thierry who discovered what he considered to be heresies in some of Abelards teaching. In spring 1140 he wrote to the Bishop of Chartres and to Bernard of Clairvaux denouncing them. Another less distinguished theologian Thomas of Morigny also produced at the same time a list of Abelards supposed heresies perhaps at Bernards instigation. Bernards complaint mainly is that Abelard has applied logic where it is not applicable and that is illogical.

Amid pressure from Bernard Abelard challenged Bernard either to withdraw his accusations or to make them publicly at the important church council at Sens planned for 2 June 1141. In so doing Abelard put himself into the position of the wronged party and forced Bernard to defend himself from the accusation of slander. Bernard avoided this trap however on the eve of the council he called a private meeting of the assembled bishops and persuaded them to condemn one by one each of the heretical propositions he attributed to Abelard. When Abelard appeared at the council the next day he was presented with a list of condemned propositions imputed to him.

Unable to answer to these propositions Abelard left the assembly appealed to the Pope and set off for Rome hoping that the Pope would be more supportive. However this hope was unfounded. On 16 July 1141 Pope Innocent II issued a bull excommunicating Abelard and his followers and imposing perpetual silence on him and in a second document he ordered Abelard to be confined in a monastery and his books to be burned. Abelard was saved from this sentence however by Peter the Venerable abbot of Cluny. Abelard had stopped there on his way to Rome before the papal condemnation had reached France. Peter persuaded Abelard already old to give up his journey and stay at the monastery. Peter managed to arrange a reconciliation with Bernard to have the sentence of excommunication lifted and to persuade Innocent that it was enough if Abelard remained under the aegis of Cluny. 

Abelard spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel near Chalon-sur-Saône before he died on 21 April 1142. He is said to have uttered the last words I dont know before expiring. He died from a fever while suffering from a skin disorder possibly mange or scurvy. Heloise and Peter of Cluny arranged after his death with the Pope to clear his name of heresy charges.

Abelard was first buried at St. Marcel but his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete and given over to the loving care of Héloïse who in time came herself to rest beside them in 1163.

The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the French Revolution and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.

This remains however disputed. The Oratory of the Paraclete claims Abelard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père-Lachaise is merely a monument or cenotaph. According to Père-Lachaise the remains of both lovers were transferred from the Oratory in the early 19th century and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père-Lachaise Heloïses remains are elsewhere.

Abelard suffered at least two nervous collapses the first around 11045 cited as due to the stresses of too much study. In his words Not long afterward though my health broke down under the strain of too much study and I had to return home to Brittany. I was away from France for several years bitterly missed... His second documented collapse took place in 1141 at the Council of Sens where he was accused of heresy and was unable to speak in reply. In the words of Geoffrey of Auxerre his memory became very confused his reason blacked out and his interior sense forsook him.

Medieval understanding of mental health precedes development of modern psychiatric diagnosis. No diagnosis besides ill health was applied to Abelard at the time. His tendencies towards self-acclaim grandiosityparanoia and shame are suggestive of possible latent narcissism or recently conjectured in keeping with his breakdowns overwork loquaciousness and belligerence mood-related mental health issues such as mania related to bipolar disorder.

At the time some of these characteristics were attributed disparagingly to his Breton heritage his difficult indomitable personality and overwork.

Abelard is considered one of the founders of the secular university and pre-Renaissance secular philosophical thought.

Abelard argued for conceptualism in the theory of universals. According to Abelard scholar David Luscombe Abelard logically elaborated an independent philosophy of language... he stressed that language itself is not able to demonstrate the truth of things that lie in the domain of physics.

Writing with the influence of his wife Heloise he stressed that subjective intention determines the moral value of human action. With Heloise he is the first significant philosopher of the Middle Ages to push for intentionalist ethics before Thomas Aquinas.

He helped establish the philosophical authority of Aristotle which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that Aristotles Organon first became available and gradually all of Aristotles other surviving works. Before this the works of Plato formed the basis of support for philosophical realism.

Abelard is considered one of the greatest twelfth-century Catholic philosophers arguing that God and the universe can and should be known via logic as well as via the emotions. He coined the term theology for the religious branch of philosophical tradition. He should not be read as a heretic as his charges of heresy were dropped and rescinded by the Church after his death but rather as a cutting-edge philosopher who pushed theology and philosophy to their limits. He is described as the keenest thinker and boldest theologian of the 12th century and as the greatest logician of the Middle Ages. His genius was evident in all he did; as the first to use theology in its modern sense he championed reason in matters of faith and seemed larger than life to his contemporaries his quick wit sharp tongue perfect memory and boundless arrogance made him unbeatable in debate--the force of his personality impressed itself vividly on all with whom he came into contact.

Regarding the unbaptized who die in infancy Abelard in Commentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos emphasized the goodness of God and interpreted Augustines mildest punishment as the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision without hope of obtaining it but with no additional punishments. His thought contributed to the forming of Limbo of Infants theory in the 12th13th centuries.

Abelard was concerned with the concept of intent and inner life developing an elementary theory of cognition in his Tractabus De Intellectibus and later developing the concept that human beings speak to God with their thoughts. He was one of the developers of the insanity defense writing in Scito te ipsum Of this reason....nothing is counted as sin for them. He spearheaded the idea that mental illness was a natural condition and debunked the idea that the devil caused insanity a point of view which Thomas F. Graham argues Abelard was unable to separate himself from objectively to argue more subtly because of his own mental health.

Abelard stressed that subjective intention determines the moral value of human action and therefore that the legal consequence of an action is related to the person that commits it and not merely to the action. With this doctrine Abelard created in the Middle Ages the idea of the individual subject central to modern law. This gave to School of Notre-Dame de Paris a recognition for its expertise in the area of Law even before the faculty of law existed and the school even recognized as an universitas and even if Abelard was a logician and a theologian.

The story of Abelard and Héloïse has proved immensely popular in modern European culture. This story is known almost entirely from a few sources first the Historia Calamitatum; secondly the seven letters between Abelard and Héloïse which survive and always follow the Historia Calamitatum in the manuscript tradition; thirdly four letters between Peter the Venerable and Héloïse . They are in modern times the best known and most widely translated parts of Abelards work.

It is unclear quite how the letters of Abelard and Héloïse came to be preserved. There are brief and factual references to their relationship by 12th-century writers including William Godel and Walter Map. While the letters were most likely exchanged by horseman in a public fashion readable by others at stops along the way it seems unlikely that the letters were widely known outside of their original travel range during the period. Rather the earliest manuscripts of the letters are dated to the late 13th century. It therefore seems likely that the letters sent between Abelard and Héloïse were kept by Héloïse at the Paraclete along with the Letters of Direction and that more than a century after her death they were brought to Paris and copied.

Shortly after the deaths of Abelard and Heloise Chrétien de Troyes appears influenced by Heloises letters and Abelards castration in his depiction of the fisher king in his grail tales. In the fourteenth century the story of their love affair was summarised by Jean de Meun in the Le Roman de la Rose.Chaucer makes a brief reference in the Wife of Baths Prologue and may base his character of the wife partially on Heloise. Petrarch owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couples letters . 

The first Latin publication of the letters was in Paris in 1616 simultaneously in two editions. These editions gave rise to numerous translations of the letters into European languages and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest in the story of the medieval lovers. In the 18th century the couple were revered as tragic lovers who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation they were the only individuals from the pre-Revolutionary period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of Père Lachaise in Paris. At this time they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some they were forerunners of modernity at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.

The Historia was first published in 1841 by John Caspar Orelli of Turici. Then in 1849 Victor Cousin published Petri Abaelardi opera in part based on the two Paris editions of 1616 but also based on the reading of four manuscripts; this became the standard edition of the letters. Soon after in 1855 Migne printed an expanded version of the 1616 edition under the title Opera Petri Abaelardi without the name of Héloïse on the title page.

Critical editions of the Historia Calamitatum and the letters were subsequently published in the 1950s and 1960s. The most well-established documents and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest are the series of letters that begin with the Historia Calamitatum and encompass four personal letters and letters of direction . 

Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by Héloïse and Abelard themselves. John Benton is the most prominent modern skeptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson Peter Dronke Constant Mews and Mary Ellen Waite maintain the mainstream view that the letters are genuine arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by pre-conceived notions. 

More recently it has been argued that an anonymous series of letters the Epistolae Duorum Amantium were in fact written by Héloïse and Abelard during their initial romance . This argument has been advanced by Constant J. Mews based on earlier work by Ewad Könsgen. If genuine these letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by Héloïse and thus open several new directions for further scholarship. However because the attribution is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence it is not accepted by all scholars.

Novelist and Abelard scholar George Moore referred to Abelard as the first protestant prior to Martin Luther. While Abelard conflicted with the Church to point of heresy charges he never denied his Catholic faith.

During his general audience on 4 November 2009 Pope Benedict XVI talked about Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and Peter Abelard to illustrate differences in the monastic and scholastic approaches to theology in the 12th century. The Pope recalled that theology is the search for a rational understanding of the mysteries of Christian revelation which is believed through faith faith that seeks intelligibility . But St. Bernard a representative of monastic theology emphasized faith whereas Abelard who is a scholastic stressed understanding through reason.

For Bernard of Clairvaux faith is based on the testimony of Scripture and on the teaching of the Fathers of the Church. Thus Bernard found it difficult to agree with Abelard and in a more general way with those who would subject the truths of faith to the critical examination of reason an examination which in his opinion posed a grave danger intellectualism the relativizing of truth and the questioning of the truths of faith themselves. Theology for Bernard could be nourished only in contemplative prayer by the affective union of the heart and mind with God with only one purpose to promote the living intimate experience of God; an aid to loving God ever more and ever better.

According to Pope Benedict XVI an excessive use of philosophy rendered Abelards doctrine of the Trinity fragile and thus his idea of God. In the field of morals his teaching was vague as he insisted on considering the intention of the subject as the only basis for describing the goodness or evil of moral acts thereby ignoring the objective meaning and moral value of the acts resulting in a dangerous subjectivism. But the Pope recognized the great achievements of Abelard who made a decisive contribution to the development of scholastic theology which eventually expressed itself in a more mature and fruitful way during the following century. And some of Abelards insights should not be underestimated for example his affirmation that non-Christian religious traditions already contain some form of preparation for welcoming Christ.

Pope Benedict XVI concluded that Bernards theology of the heart and Abelards theology of reason represent the importance of healthy theological discussion and humble obedience to the authority of the Church especially when the questions being debated have not been defined by the magisterium. St. Bernard and even Abelard himself always recognized without any hesitation the authority of the magisterium. Abelard showed humility in acknowledging his errors and Bernard exercised great benevolence. The Pope emphasized in the field of theology there should be a balance between architectonic principles which are given through Revelation and which always maintain their primary importance and the interpretative principles proposed by philosophy which have an important function but only as a tool. When the balance breaks down theological reflection runs the risk of becoming marred by error; it is then up to the magisterium to exercise the needed service to truth for which it is responsible.

Abelard was also long known as an important poet and composer. He composed some celebrated love songs for Héloïse that are now lost and which have not been identified in the anonymous repertoire. Héloïse praised these songs in a letter The great charm and sweetness in language and music and a soft attractiveness of the melody obliged even the unlettered. His education in music was based in his childhood learning of the traditional quadrivium studied at the time by almost all aspiring medieval scholars.

Abelard composed a hymnbook for the religious community that Héloïse joined. This hymnbook written after 1130 differed from contemporary hymnals such as that of Bernard of Clairvaux in that Abelard used completely new and homogeneous material. The songs were grouped by metre which meant that it was possible to use comparatively few melodies. Only one melody from this hymnal survives O quanta qualia.

Abelard also wrote six biblical planctus 

In surviving manuscripts these pieces have been notated in diastematic neumes which resist reliable transcription. Only Planctus VI was fixed in square notation. Planctus as genre influenced the subsequent development of the lai a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries.

Melodies that have survived have been praised as flexible expressive melodies show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Abelards poetry."
Sylviane Agacinski,"Sylviane Agacinski-Jospin is a French philosopher feminist author professor at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales and wife of Lionel Jospin former Prime Minister of France. Her theoretical articulation of parity inspired the French law which requires every political party to fill 50 percent of all candidacies in every seat with women.

Agacinskis parents were immigrants from Poland and her sister is French actress Sophie Agacinski. Agacinski is the mother of a son by philosopher Jacques Derrida who directed the EHESS and she became the stepmother of Lionel Jospins two children with their marriage.

Agacinski met Jospin in 1983 at her sister Sophies wedding. They married 11 years later. She stayed on the sidelines in Jospins candidacy for president in 1995 but was much more active in his candidacy for president in 2002. At that time she changed her name to Agacinski-Jospin to bow to the will of the people but continues to use her maiden name as a philosopher. In the fall of 2002 after Jospins surprise exclusion from the runoffs to Jacques Chirac and Jean-Marie Le Pen Agacinski published Journal Interrompu a book about the election in diary form blaming Chirac the French media and the French lefts internal rivalries.

As a feminist philosopher Agacinski is associated with differentialism an important strain of French feminism which argues that the human condition cannot be understood in any universal way without reference to both sexes. Shes cited as writing We want to keep the freedom to seduce and be seduced. There will never be a war of the sexes in France in her 1998 book Sexual Politics.

In 1999 Agacinski was a leading originator of a bill to amend article three of the Constitution of France to include a phrase stating The law will encourage equal access for women and men to political life and elected posts. With Jospins support the so-called Parité amendment was made on June 28 1999 and was followed by a law on May 3 2000 obliging the countrys political parties to present 50 female candidacies in virtually any race or lose a corresponding share of their governmental campaign funding. In the 2002 legislative elections the first under the new law Le Pens National Front was among the few parties to come close to meeting the law with 49 female candidates; Jospins Socialists had 36 and Chiracs UMP had 19.6."
Pierre d'Ailly,"Pierre dAilly was a French theologian astrologer and cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.

DAilly was born in Compiègne in 1350 or 1351 of a prosperous bourgeois family. He studied in Paris at the Collège de Navarre receiving the licentiate in arts in 1367 and the masters a year later and was active in university affairs by 1372. DAilly taught the Bible in 1375 and the Sentences of Peter Lombard in 13761377 and received the licentiate and doctorate in theology in 1381. He was affiliated with the university serving as rector in 1384; among his pupils were Jean Gerson and Nicholas of Clémanges.

The churchs Great Schism between two popes arose in 1378. In the spring of 1379 dAilly in anticipation even of the decision of the University of Paris had carried to the pope of Avignon Clement VII the role of the French nation. Notwithstanding this prompt adhesion he was firm in his desire to put an end to the schism and when on 20 May 1381 the university decreed that the best means to this end was to gather together a general council dAilly supported this motion before the kings council in the presence of the Duke of Anjou. The dissatisfaction displayed shortly after by the government obliged the university to give up this scheme and this was probably the cause of Pierre dAillys temporary retirement to Noyon where he held a canonry. There he continued the struggle for his side in a humorous work in which the partisans of the council are amusingly taken to task by the demon Leviathan.

DAilly returned to prominence by leading the universitys effort to secure removal of John Blanchard as chancellor in which Blanchard was accused by dAilly before the Avignon antipope Clement VII of abuse of office. Subsequently dAilly was twice entrusted with a mission to Clement VII in 1388 to defend the doctrines of the university and especially those concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin against the preaching friar Jean de Montson and in 1389 to petition in the name of the king for the canonization of the young cardinal Pierre de Luxembourg. The success which attended his efforts on these two occasions and the eloquence which he displayed perhaps contributed to his choice as the kings almoner and confessor. At the same time by means of an exchange he obtained to the highest dignity in the university becoming chancellor of Notre Dame de Paris. This acceptability to many interests helps explain his advancement.

DAilly served as chancellor of the University from 1389 to 1395 and Gerson succeeded him. Both were involved in expelling the Dominican Order from the university for refusing to embrace the idea of the Immaculate Conception and in the effort mentioned above to end the Great Schism by means of an ecumenical council.

When Antipope Benedict XIII succeeded Clement VII at Avignon in 1394 dAilly was entrusted by the king with a mission of congratulation to the new pontiff. His obsequious language on this occasion and the favours with which it was rewarded formed a too violent contrast to the determined attitude of the university of Paris which tired of the schism was even then demanding the resignation of the two pontiffs. DAilly himself had not long before taken part in the drawing up of a letter to the king in which the advantages of this double abdication were set forth but since then his zeal had seemed to cool a little. Nevertheless on his return from Avignon he again in the presence of the king enlarged upon the advantages offered by the way which the university commended.

The suspicions aroused by his conduct found further confirmation when he caused himselfor allowed himselfto be nominated bishop of Le Puy by Benedict on 2 April 1395. The great number of benefices which he held left room for some doubt as to his disinterestedness. Henceforward he was under suspicion at the university and was excluded from the assemblies where the union was discussed.

DAillys ecclesiastical career prospered however. After Le Puy he was appointed Bishop of Noyon and Bishop of Cambrai . By virtue of this position he became also a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to take possession of his new episcopal see he had to brave the wrath of Philip Duke of Burgundy override the resistance of the clergy and bourgeoisie and even withstand an armed attack on the part of several lords; but his protector the duke of Orleans had his investiture performed by Wenceslaus king of the Romans. The latter though a partisan of the pope of Rome took the opportunity of enjoining on dAilly to go in his name and argue with the pope of Avignon a move which had as its object to persuade Benedict to an abdication the necessity of which was becoming more and more evident. However the language of dAilly seems on this occasion to have been lacking in decision; however that may be it led to no felicitous result. From this point on he spent most of his energy to addressing the schism. Although he was slow at first to embrace the conciliar solution to the Schism he was participating in councils by 1409.

France next tried to bring violent pressure to bear to conquer the obstinacy of Benedict XIII by threatening a formal withdrawal from his obedience. DAilly who in spite of his attachment to the pope had been carried away by the example of the kingdom was among the first who in 1403 after experience of what had happened counselled and celebrated the restoration of obedience. He was sent by Charles VI on an embassy to Benedict and seized this opportunity of lavishing on the pontiff friendly congratulations mingled with useful advice. Two years later before the same pontiff he preached in the city of Genoa a sermon which led to the general institution in the countries of the obedience of Avignon of the festival of the Holy Trinity.

At the ecclesiastical council which took place at Paris in 1406 dAilly made every effort to avert a new withdrawal from the obedience and by order of the king took the part of defender of Benedict XIII a course which yet again exposed him to attacks from the university party. The following year he and his disciple Gerson formed part of the great embassy sent by the princes to the two pontiffs and while in Italy he was occupied in praiseworthy but vain efforts to induce the pope of Rome to remove himself to a town on the Italian coast in the neighbourhood of his rival where it was hoped that the double abdication would take place. Discouraged by his failure to effect this he returned to his diocese of Cambrai at the beginning of 1408. At this time he was still faithful to Benedict and the disinclination he felt to joining the members of the French clergy who were on the point of ratifying the royal declaration of neutrality excited the anger of Charles VIs government and a mandate which was however not executed ordered the arrest of the bishop.

It was not until after the cardinals of the two colleges had led to the convocation of the Council of Pisa that dAilly renounced his support of Benedict XIII and for want of a better policy again allied himself with the cause which he had championed in his youth. In the council lay now to judge from his words the only chance of salvation; and in view of the requirements of the case he began to argue that in case of schism a council could be convoked by any one of the faithful and would have the right to judge and even to depose the rival pontiffs. This was in fact the procedure of the council of Pisa in which dAilly took part. After the declaration of the deposition of the Roman pope Gregory XII and Benedict XIII the council went on to elect Alexander V . This pope reigned only ten months; his successor John XXIII raised dAilly to the rank of cardinal and further to indemnify him for the loss of the bishopric of Cambrai conferred upon him the administration of that of Limoges which was shortly after exchanged for the bishopric of Orange. He also nominated dAilly as his legate in Germany .

Forgetting these benefits dAilly was one of the most formidable adversaries of John XXIII at the Council of Constance ; with Gerson dAilly was one of the leading theologians at the council. Convinced as he was of the necessity for union and reform he contributed more than anyone to the adoption of the principle that since the schism had survived the Council of Pisa it was necessary again to take up the work for a fundamental union without considering the rights of John XXIII any more than they had those of Gregory XII and Benedict XIII. From this point of view dAilly together with his compatriot Cardinal Fillastre took the preponderating part during the first few months. Afterwards seeing the trend of events he showed some uneasiness and hesitation. He refused however to undertake the defence of John XXIII and only appeared in the trial of this pope to make depositions against him which were sometimes of an overwhelming character.

Other matters which claimed his attention at Constance included the condemnation of John Wycliffe and the trial of Jan Hus. The reading in public of Huss two treatises De Potestate ecclesiastica and De Reformatione Ecclesiae revealed besides ideas very peculiar to himself on the reform and constitution of the church his design of reducing the power of the English in the council by denying them the right of forming a separate nation . By this campaign which exposed him to the worst retaliation of the English he inaugurated his role of procurator and defender of the king of France.

When at last the question arose of giving the Christian world a new pope this time sole and uncontested dAilly defended the right of the cardinals if not to keep the election entirely in their own hands at any rate to share in the election and he brought forward a system for reconciling the pretensions of the council with the rights of the College of Cardinals. In this way was elected Pope Martin V and the task of dAilly was at last finished.

After the council dAilly returned to Paris. When in Frances civil discord the Burgundian faction seized Paris in 1419 killing some professors in the process he fled south and retired to Avignon. His former pupil Gerson settled nearby at a house of the Celestine Order. DAilly known as the Cardinal of Cambrai died in 1420 in Avignon.

DAilly wrote extensively on the Schism reform astrology and other topics. His ideas on the powers of the college of cardinals and the infallibility of the general council were very influential. DAillys Imago Mundi a work of cosmography influenced Christopher Columbus in his estimates of the size of the world. Many questions in science and astrology such as calendar reform attracted his attention. His views on astrology expressed in several works attempted to balance divine omniscience and human free will. DAillys writings on the Schism put the crisis and the need for reform into an apocalyptic context. His astrology also was tied to the Schism attempting to determine whether the division of the church was a sign of the coming of the Antichrist. His works began appearing in print before the end of the fifteenth century.

In The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon Karl Marx wrote that dAilly had told advocates of ethical reform at the Council of Constance Only the devil in person can still save the Catholic Church and you ask for angels.

The crater Aliacensis on the Moon is named after him."
Émile Chartier,"Alain was born in 1868 in Mortagne-au-Perche . He entered lycée dAlençon in 1881 and studied there for five years. On 13 June 1956 the lycée was renamed lycée Alain after its most famous student.

In 1892 Alain graduated from École Normale Supérieure and received the agrégation in philosophy. He subsequently taught at various institutions Pontivy Lorient Lycée Pierre Corneille in Rouen and in Paris . From 1903 he contributed to several journals using his pseudonym Alain. He was most commonly referred to as Alain by his pupils and peers.

In 1909 he was appointed a teacher at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris. He deeply influenced his pupils who included Raymond Aron Simone Weil Georges Canguilhem and André Maurois. Reviewing the beneficial effect he had on his former pupils Simone Weil and Simone de Beauvoir Professor John Hellman writes that Alain was the greatest teacher of their generation.

Alain foretold and denounced the First World War but when hostilities began he enlisted as a soldier and refusing promotion served in the ranks for the whole war. During those years while in the trenches he wrote Mars ou la guerre jugée .

He later wrote many other books including Propos sur le bonheur .

He was a leading theorist of radicalism and his influence extended through the Third and Fourth Republics. He stressed individualism seeking to defend the citizen against the state. He warned against all forms of power military clerical and economic. To oppose them he exalted the small farmer the small shopkeeper the small town and the little man. He idealized country life and saw Paris as a dangerous font of power. Despite the liberalism of his published work during World War II he expressed right-wing views in some of his private writings in July 1940 he expressed hope that the Free French Forces would be defeated and he also described Adolf Hitler as a modern mind an invincible spirit who dealt with the Jewish question with extraordinary eloquence and remarkable sincerity.

In his diary published under the title Journal inédit by Emmanuel Blondel Alain writes I would like as far as I am concerned to get rid of antisemitism but I cant achieve this. . He calls his own antisemitism in a self-disapproving manner a sad passion using a spinozist expression meaning a passion that expresses weakness powerlessness. In 1946 in a new Preface to his book Spinoza Alain writes Tel est donc le sens du Spinozisme sens bien positif et bien aisé à saisir pourvu quon soit persuadé que lon est en présence de lEsprit universel. Cette persuasion vous rendra la pensée supportable et soudain vous vous reconnaîtrez homme toujours à la lumière de laxiome Homo homini deus qui est la clef de la future République et de légalité 1848. Je dis égalité parce quil ne se peut pas que lhomme nait pas de passions et parce que toute affection cesse dêtre une passion dès quon en forme une idée adéquate. Là est le secret de la Paix qui dans tous les cas est la Paix de lâme vérité très méconnue. Par ce moyen vous formerez le parti Spinoza que vous vous garderez dappeler le parti juif mais qui nen sera pas moins ce parti-là. Alors sans combat le nazisme le fascisme et toute sorte de despotisme seront vaincus et la méchanceté exactement impuissante comme elle est . Tel est lavenir prochain que renferme ce petit livre. The last lines of this quotation expressing Alains public thought regarding antisemitic hatred and nazism deserve attention Then without fight nazism fascism and all other kinds of despotism will be defeated and malevolence will be properly powerless as it is actually . Such is the future that is coming the future that is contained in this little book. .

The same ambiguity can be observed as to Alains attitude towards Hitler. In his Propos Alain writes that Hitler is a great patriot. But he adds When I say that Hitler is one of these great leaders understand carefully that I feel sorry for the people that have such leaders and also sorry for their neighbours. .

He died in 1951. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery."
Ferdinand Alquié,"Ferdinand Alquié ; 18 December 1906 Carcassonne Aude 28 February 1985 Montpellier was a French philosopher and member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques from 1978.

In the years 1931 to 1945 he was a professor in various provincial and Parisian lycees and later at the University of Montpellier and Sorbonne where he worked until he retired in 1979.

Alquiés career was dominated by the decades-long polemic between himself as a Cartesian and the Spinozian perspective of his rival Martial Gueroult. He was vehemently opposed to all forms of philosophical monism and felt that human life is permeated by various forms of dualism. He was opposed to totalitarianism as well as to Marxism; as a close friend of André Breton he aligned himself with the surrealist project.

He was an instructor of Gilles Deleuze whom according to Michael Hardt he accused of drawing on biology psychology and other fields neglecting philosophy. Deleuze responded by agreeing with Alquié and moreover he argued that his primary interest was precisely in the metaphysics science needs rather than in the science philosophy needs. Alquié went on to direct Deleuzes secondary thesis Expressionism in Philosophy Spinoza. Also among his students at the Sorbonne was the Finnish feminist philosopher and Descartes specialist Lilli Alanen. 

Alquié has published many books about Descartes Kant and Spinoza as well as a book on Nicolas Malebranche. He was close to the artist André Breton and wrote Philosophy of Surrealism which espoused a view of surrealism as a form of humanism that values the vibrant potential of the unconscious mind."
Louis Althusser,"Louis Pierre Althusser was a French Marxist philosopher. He was born in Algeria and studied at the École normale supérieure in Paris where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.

Althusser was a long-time member and sometimes a strong critic of the French Communist Party . His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism.

Althussers life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In 1980 he killed his wife the sociologist Hélène Rytmann by strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity and committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little further academic work dying in 1990.

Althusser was born in French Algeria in the town of Birmendreïs near Algiers to a pied-noir petit-bourgeois family from Alsace France. His father Charles-Joseph Althusser was a lieutenant officer in the French army and a bank clerk while his mother Lucienne Marthe Berger a devout Roman Catholic worked as a schoolteacher. According to his own memoirs his Algerian childhood was prosperous; historian Martin Jay said that Althusser along with Albert Camus and Jacques Derrida was a product of the French colonial culture in Northern Africa. In 1930 his family moved to the French city of Marseille as his father was to be the director of the Compagnie algérienne de banque branch in the city. Althusser spent the rest of his childhood there excelling in his studies at the Lycée Saint-Charles and joining a scout group. A second displacement occurred in 1936 when Althusser settled in Lyon as a student at the Lycée du Parc. Later he was accepted by the highly regarded higher-education establishment École Normale Supérieure in Paris. At the Lycée du Parc Althusser was influenced by Catholic professors joined the Catholic youth movement Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne and wanted to be a Trappist. His interest in Catholicism coexisted with his communist ideology and some critics argued that his early Catholic introduction affected the way he interpreted Karl Marx.

After a two-year period of preparation under Jean Guitton at the Lycée du Parc Althusser was admitted into the ENS in July 1939. But his attendance was deferred by many years because he was drafted to the French Army in September of that year in the run-up to World War II and like most French soldiers following the Fall of France was captured by the Germans. Seized in Vannes in June 1940 he was held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Schleswig-Holstein in Northern Germany for the five remaining years of the war. In the camp he was at first drafted to hard labour but ultimately reassigned to work in the infirmary after falling ill. This second occupation allowed him to read philosophy and literature. In his memoirs Althusser described the experiences of solidarity political action and community in the camp as the moment he first understood the idea of communism. Althusser recalled It was in prison camp that I first heard Marxism discussed by a Parisian lawyer in transitand that I actually met a communist. His experience in the camp also affected his lifelong bouts of mental instability reflected in constant depression that lasted until the end of life. Psychoanalyst Élisabeth Roudinesco has argued that the absurd war experience was essential for Althussers philosophical thought.

Althusser resumed his studies at the ENS in 1945 to prepare himself for the agrégation an exam to teach philosophy in secondary schools. In 1946 Althusser met sociologist Hélène Rytmann a Jewish former French Resistance member with whom he was in a relationship until he killed her by strangulation in 1980. That same year he started a close friendly relationship with Jacques Martin a G. W. F. Hegel and Herman Hesse translator; Martin to whom Althusser dedicated his first book would later commit suicide. Martin was influential on Althussers interest on reading the bibliography of Jean Cavaillès Georges Canguilhem and Hegel. Although Althusser remained a Catholic he became more associated with left-wing groups joining the worker priests movement and embracing a synthesis of Christian and Marxist thought. This combination may have led him to adopt German Idealism and Hegelian thought as did Martins influence and a renewed interest on Hegel in the 1930s and 1940s in France. In consonance Althussers master thesis to obtain his diplôme détudes supèrieures was On Content in the Thought of G. W. F. Hegel . Based on The Phenomenology of Spirit and under Gaston Bachelards supervision Althusser wrote a dissertation on how Marxs philosophy refused to withdraw from the Hegelian masterslave dialectic. According to the researcher Gregory Elliott Althusser was a Hegelian at that time but only for a short period.

In 1948 he was approved to teach in secondary schools but instead made a tutor at the ENS to help students prepare for their own agrégation. His performance on the examhe was the best ranked on the writing part and second on the oral moduleguaranteed this change on his occupation. He was responsible for offering special courses and tutorials on particular topics and on particular figures from the history of philosophy. In 1954 he became secrétaire de lécole litteraire assuming responsibilities for management and direction of the school. Althusser was deeply influential at the ENS because of the lectures and conferences he organized with participation of leading French philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Lacan. He also influenced a generation of French philosophers and French philosophy in generalamong his students were Derrida Pierre Bourdieu Michel Foucault and Michel Serres. In total Althusser spent 35 years in the ENS working there until November 1980.

Parallel to his academic life Althusser joined the French Communist Party in October 1948. In the early postwar years the PCF was one of the most influential political forces and many French intellectuals joined it. Althusser himself declared Communism was in the air in 1945 after the German defeat the victory at Stalingrad and the hopes and lessons of the Resistance. Althusser was primarily active on the Peace Movement section and kept for a few years his Catholic beliefs; in 1949 he published in the LÉvangile captif the tenth book of the Jeunesse de lÉglise an article on the historic situation of Catholicism in response to the question Is the good news preached to the men today In it he wrote about the relationship between the Catholic Church and the labour movement advocating at the same time for social emancipation and the Church religious reconquest. There was mutual hostility between these two organizationsin the early 1950s the Vatican prohibited Catholics from membership in the worker priests and left-wing movementsand it certainly affected Althusser since he firmly believed in this combination.

Initially afraid of joining the party because of ENSs opposition to communists Althusser did so when he was made a tutorwhen membership became less likely to affect his employmentand he even created at ENA the Cercle Politzer a Marxist study group. Althusser also introduced colleagues and students to the party and worked closely with the communist cell of the ENS. But his professionalism made him avoid Marxism and Communism in his classes; instead he helped students depending on the demands of their agrégation. In the early 1950s Althusser distanced himself from his youthful political and philosophical ideals and from Hegel whose teachings he considered a bourgeois philosophy. Starting from 1948 he studied history of philosophy and gave lectures on it; the first was about Plato in 1949. In 19491950 he gave a lecture about René Descartes and wrote a thesis titled Politics and Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century and a small study on Jean-Jacques Rousseaus Second Discourse. He presented the thesis to Jean Hyppolite and Vladimir Jankélévitch in 1950 but it was rejected. These studies were nonetheless valuable because Althusser later used them to write his book about Montesquieus philosophy and an essay on Rousseaus The Social Contract. Indeed his first and the only book-length study published during his lifetime was Montesquieu la politique et lhistoire in 1959. He also lectured on Rousseau from 1950 to 1955 and changed his focus to philosophy of history also studying Voltaire Condorcet and Helvétius which resulted in a 19551956 lecture on Les problèmes de la philosophie de lhistoire. This course along with others on Machiavelli 17th- and 18th-century political philosophy Locke and Hobbes were later edited and released as a book by François Matheron in 2006. From 1953 to 1960 Althusser basically did not publish on Marxist themes which in turn gave him time to focus on his teaching activities and establish himself as a reputable philosopher and researcher.

Althusser resumed his Marxist-related publications in 1960 as he translated edited and published a collection directed by Hyppolite about Ludwig Feuerbachs works. The objective of this endeavour was to identify Feuerbachs influence on Marxs early writings contrasting it with the absence of his thought on Marxs mature works. This work spurred him to write On the Young Marx Theoretical Questions . Published in the journal La Pensée it was the first in a series of articles about Marx that were later grouped on his most famous book For Marx. He inflamed the French debate on Marx and Marxist philosophy and gained a considerable number of supporters. Inspired by this recognition he started to publish more articles on Marxist thought; in 1964 Althusser published an article titled Freud and Lacan in the journal La Nouvelle Critique which greatly influenced the Freudo-Marxism thought. At the same time he invited Lacan to a lecture on Baruch Spinoza and the fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis. The impact of the articles led Althusser to change his teaching style at the ENS and he started to minister a series of seminars on the following topics On the Young Marx The Origins of Structuralism Lacan and Psychoanalysis and Reading Capital . These seminars aimed for a return to Marx and were attended by a new generation of students.

For Marx and Reading Capital both published in 1965 brought international fame to Althusser. Despite being criticized widely these books made Althusser a sensation in French intellectual circles and one of the leading theoreticians of the PCF. He supported a structuralist view of Marxs work influenced by Cavaillès and Canguilhem affirming that Marx left the cornerstones of a new science incomparable to all non-Marxist thought of which from 1960 to 1966 he espoused the fundamental principles. Critiques were done to Stalins cult of personality and Althusser defended what he called theoretical anti-humanism as an alternative to Stalinism and the Marxist humanismboth popular at the time. At mid-decade his popularity grew to the point that it was virtually impossible to have an intellectual debate about political or ideological theoretical questions without mentioning his name. Althussers ideas were influential enough to arouse the creation of a young militants group to dispute the power within the PCF. Nevertheless the official position of the party was still Stalinist Marxism which was criticized both from Maoist and humanist groups. Althusser was initially careful not to identify with Maoism but progressively agreed with its critique of Stalinism. At the end of 1966 Althusser even published an unsigned article titled On the Cultural Revolution in which he considered the beginning of the Chinese Cultural Revolution as a historical fact without precedent and of enormous theoretical interest. Althusser mainly praised the non-bureaucratic non-party mass organizations in which in his opinion the Marxist principles regarding the nature of the ideological were fully applied.

Key events in the theoretical struggle took place in 1966. In January there was a conference of communist philosophers in Choisy-le-Roi; Althusser was absent but Roger Garaudy the official philosopher of the party read an indictment that opposed the theoretical anti-humanism. The controversy was the pinnacle of a long conflict between the supporters of Althusser and Garaudy. In March in Argenteuil the theses of Garaudy and Althusser were formally confronted by the PCF Central Committee chaired by Louis Aragon. The Party decided to keep Garaudys position as the official one and even Lucien Sèvewho was a student of Althusser at the beginning of his teaching at the ENSsupported it becoming the closest philosopher to the PCF leadership. General secretary of the party Waldeck Rochet said that Communism without humanism would not be Communism. Even if he was not publicly censured nor expelled from the PCF as were 600 Maoist students the support of Garaudy resulted in a further reduction of Althussers influence in the party.

Still in 1966 Althusser published in the Cahiers pour lAnalyse the article On the Social Contract a course about Rousseau he had given at the ENS and Cremonini Painter of the Abstract about Italian painter Leonardo Cremonini. In the following year he wrote a long article titled The Historical Task of Marxist Philosophy that was submitted to the Soviet journal Voprossi Filosofii; it was not accepted but was published a year later in a Hungarian journal. In 19671968 Althusser and his students organized an ENS course titled Philosophy Course for Scientists that would be interrupted by May 1968 events. Some of the material of the course was reused in his 1974 book Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists . Another Althussers significant work from this period was Lenin and Philosophy a lecture first presented in February 1968 at the French Society of Philosophy.

During the events of May 1968 Althusser was hospitalized because of a depressive breakdown and was absent in the Latin Quarter. Many of his students participated in the events and Régis Debray in particular became an international celebrity revolutionary. Althussers initial silence was met with criticism by the protesters who wrote on walls Of what use is Althusser . Later Althusser was ambivalent about it; on the one hand he was not supportive of the movement and he criticized the movement as an ideological revolt of the mass adopting the PCF official argument that an infantile disorder of anarchistic utopianism that had infiltrated the student movement. On the other hand he called it the most significant event in Western history since the Resistance and the victory over Nazism and wanted to reconcile the students and the PCF. Nevertheless the Maoist journal La Cause du peuple called him a revisionist and he was condemned by former students mainly by Jacques Rancière. After it Althusser went through a phase of self-criticism that resulted in the book Essays in Self-criticism in which he revisited some of his old positions including his support of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In 1969 Althusser started an unfinished work that was only released in 1995 as Sur la reproduction . However from these early manuscripts he developed Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses which was published in the journal La Pensée in 1970 and became very influential on ideology discussions. In the same year Althusser wrote Marxism and Class Struggle that would be the foreword to the book The Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism of his former student the Chilean Marxist sociologist Marta Harnecker. By this time Althusser was very popular in Latin America some leftist activists and intellectuals saw him almost as a new Marx although his work has been the subject of heated debates and sharp criticism. As an example of this popularity some of his works were first translated to Spanish than into English and others were released in book format first in Spanish and then in French. At the turn from the 1960s to the 1970s Althussers major works were translated into EnglishFor Marx in 1969 and Reading Capital in 1970disseminating his ideas among the English-speaking Marxists.

In the early 1970s the PCF was as most of European Communist parties in a period of internal conflicts on strategic orientation that occurred against the backdrop of the emergence of Eurocommunism. In this context Althusserian structuralist Marxism was one of the more or less defined strategic lines. Althusser participated in various public events of the PCF most notably the public debate Communists Intellectuals and Culture in 1973. He and his supporters contested the partys leadership over its decision to abandon the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat during its twenty-second congress in 1976. The PCF considered that in European condition it was possible to have a peaceful transition to socialism which Althusser saw as a new opportunistic version of Marxist Humanism. In a lecture given to the Union of Communist Students in the same year he criticized above all the form in which this decision was taken. According to Althusserechoing his notion of French misery exposed on For Marxthe party demonstrated a contempt for the materialist theory when it suppressed a scientific concept. This struggle ultimately resulted in the debacle of the fraction Union of the Left and an open letter written by Althusser and five other intellectuals in which they asked for a real political discussion in the PCF. That same year Althusser also published a series of articles in the newspaper Le Monde under the title of What Must Change in the Party. Published between 25 and 28 April they were expanded and reprinted in May 1978 by François Maspero as the book Ce qui ne peut plus durer dans le parti communiste. Between 1977 and 1978 Althusser mainly elaborated texts criticizing Eurocommunism and the PCF. Marx in his Limits an abandoned manuscript wrote in 1978 argued that there was no Marxist theory of the state and it was only published in 1994 in the Écrits philosophiques et politiques I. The Italian Communist newspaper Il manifesto allowed Althusser to develop new ideas on a conference held in Venice about Power and Opposition in Post-Revolutionary Societies in 1977. His speeches resulted into the articles The Crisis of Marxism and Marxism as a finite theory in which he stressed something vital and alive can be liberated by this crisis the perception of Marxism as a theory that originally only reflected Marxs time and then needed to be completed by a state theory. The former was published as Marxism Today in the 1978 Italian Enciclopedia Europea. The latter text was included in a book published in Italy Discutere lo Stato and he criticized the notion of government party and defended the notion of a revolutionary party out of state.

During the 1970s Althussers institutional roles at the ENS increased but he still edited and published his and other works in the series Théorie with François Maspero. Among the essays published there was Response to John Lewis a 1973 reply of an English Communists defence of Marxist Humanism. Two years later he concluded his Doctorat dÉtat in the University of Picardie Jules Verne and acquired the right to direct research on the basis of his previously published work. Some time after this recognition Althusser married Hélène Rytmann. In 1976 he compiled several of his essays written between 1964 and 1975 to publish Positions. These years would be a period in which his work was very intermittent; he gave a conference titled The Transformation of Philosophy in two Spanish cities first Granada and then in Madrid in March 1976. The same year he gave a lecture in Catalonia titled Quelques questions de la crise de la théorie marxiste et du mouvement communiste international in which Althusser outlined empiricism as the main enemy of class struggle. He also started a rereading of Machiavelli that would influence his later work; he worked between 1975 and 1976 on Machiavel et nous a draft only published posthumously based on a 1972 lecture and also wrote for the National Foundation of Political Science a piece titled Machiavellis Solitude . In Spring 1976 requested by Léon Chertok to write for the International Symposium on the Unconscious at Tbilisi he drafted a presentation titled The Discovery of Dr. Freud . After sending it to Chertok and some friends he was unsettled by the requested criticism he received by Jacques Nassif and Roudinesco and then by December he wrote a new essay On Marx and Freud. He could not attend the event in 1979 and asked Chertok to replace the texts but Chertok published the first without his consent. This would become a public affair in 1984 when Althusser finally noticed it by the time Chertok republished it in a book titled Dialogue franco-soviétique sur la psychanalyse.

After the PCF and the left were defeated in the French legislative elections of 1978 Atlhussers bouts of depression became more severe and frequent. In March 1980 Althusser interrupted the dissolution session of the École Freudienne de Paris and in the name of the analysts called Lacan a beautiful and pitiful harlequin. Later he went through a hiatal hernia-removal surgery as he had difficulties breathing while eating. According to Althusser himself the operation caused his physical and mental state to deteriorate; in particular he developed a persecution complex and suicidal thoughts. He would recall later

I wanted not only to destroy myself physically but to wipe out all trace of my time on earth in particular to destroy every last one of my books and all my notes and burn the École Normale and also if possible suppress Hélène herself while I still could.

After the surgery in May he was hospitalized for most of the summer in a Parisian clinic. His condition did not improve but in early October he was sent home. Upon returning he wanted to get away from ENS and even proposed to buy Roudinescos house. He and Rytmann were also convinced about the human decline and so he tried to talk to the Pope John Paul II through his former professor Jean Guitton. Most of the time however he and his wife spent locked in their ENS apartment. In the fall of 1980 Althussers psychiatrist René Diatkine who by now was also treating Althussers wife Hélène Rytmann recommended that Althusser be hospitalized but the couple refused.

Before me Hélène lying on her back also wearing a dressing gown.... Kneeling beside her leaning over her body I am engaged in massaging her neck.... I press my two thumbs into the hollow of flesh that borders the top of the sternum and applying force I slowly reach one thumb toward the right one thumb toward the left at an angle the firmer area below the ears.... Hélènes face is immobile and serene her open eyes are fixed on the ceiling. And suddenly I am struck with terror her eyes are interminably fixed and above all here is the tip of her tongue lying unusually and peacefully between her teeth and her lips. I had certainly seen corpses before but I had never seen the face of a strangled woman in my life. And yet I know that this is a strangled woman. What is happening I stand up and scream Ive strangled Hélène

On 16 November 1980 Althusser strangled Rytmann in their ENS room. He himself reported the murder to the doctor in residence who contacted psychiatric institutions. Even before the police arrival the doctor and the director of ENS decided to hospitalize him in the Sainte-Anne hospital and a psychiatric examination was conducted on him. Due to his mental state Althusser was deemed to not understand the charges or the process to which he was to be submitted so he remained at the hospital. The psychiatric assessment concluded he should not be criminally charged based on article 64 of the French Penal Code which stated that there is neither crime nor delict where the suspect was in a state of dementia at the time of the action. The report said Althusser killed Rytmann in the course of an acute crisis of melancholy without even realizing it and that the wife-murder by manual strangulation was committed without any additional violence in the course of iatrogenic hallucinatory episode complicated by melancholic depression. As a result he lost his civil rights entrusted to a representative of the law and he was forbidden to sign any documents. In February 1981 the court ruled Althusser as having been mentally irresponsible when he committed the murder therefore he could not be prosecuted and was not charged. Nonetheless a warrant of confinement was subsequently issued by the Paris police prefecture; the Ministry of National Education mandated his retirement from the ENS; and the ENS requested his family and friends to clear out his apartment. In June he was transferred to the LEau-Vive clinic at Soisy-sur-Seine.

The murder of Rytmann attracted much media attention and there were several requests to treat Althusser as an ordinary criminal. The newspaper Minute journalist Dominique Jamet and Minister of Justice Alain Peyrefitte were among those who accused Althusser of having privileges because of the fact he was Communist. From this point of view Roudinesco wrote Althusser was three times a criminal. First the philosopher had legitimated the current of thought judged responsible for the Gulag; second he praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution as an alternative to both capitalism and Stalinism; and finally because he had it was said corrupted the elite of French youth by introducing the cult of a criminal ideology into the heart of one of the best French institutions. Philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff went further on claiming Althusser taught his students to perceive crimes positively as akin to a revolution. Five years after the murder a critique by Le Mondes Claude Sarraute would have a great impact on Althusser. She compared his case to the situation of Issei Sagawa who killed and cannibalized a woman in France but whose psychiatric diagnosis absolved him. Sarraute criticized the fact that when prestigious names are involved a lot is written about them but that little is written about the victim. Althussers friends persuaded him to speak in his defense and the philosopher wrote an autobiography in 1985. He showed the result Lavenir dure longtemps to some of his friends and considered publishing it but he never sent it to a publisher and locked it in his desk drawer. The book was only published posthumously in 1992.

Despite the critics some of his friends such as Guitton and Debray defended Althusser saying the murder was an act of loveas Althusser argued too. Rytmann had bouts of melancholy and self-medicated because of this. Guitton said I sincerely think that he killed his wife out of love of her. It was a crime of mystical love. Debray compared it to an altruistic suicide He suffocated her under a pillow to save her from the anguish that was suffocating him. A beautiful proof of love ... that one can save ones skin while sacrificing oneself for the other only to take upon oneself all the pain of living. In his autobiography written to be the public explanation he could not provide in court Althusser stated that she matter-of-factly asked me to kill her myself and this word unthinkable and intolerable in its horror caused my whole body to tremble for a long time. It still makes me tremble... We were living shut up in the cloister of our hell both of us.

I killed a woman who was everything to me during a crisis of mental confusion she who loved me to the point of wanting only to die because she could not continue living. And no doubt in my confusion and unconsciousness I did her this service which she did not try to prevent but from which she died.

The crime seriously tarnished Althussers reputation. As Roudinesco wrote from 1980 he lived his life as a specter a dead man walking. Althusser forcibly lived in various public and private clinics until 1983 when he became a voluntary patient. He was able to start an untitled manuscript during this time in 1982; it was later published as The Underground Current of the Materialism of the Encounter . From 1984 to 1986 he stayed at an apartment in the north of Paris where he remained confined most of his time but he also received visits from some friends such as philosopher and theologian Stanislas Breton who had also been a prisoner in the German stalags; from Guitton who converted him into mystic monk in Roudinescos words; and from Mexican philosopher Fernanda Navarro during six months starting from the winter of 1984. Althusser and Navarro exchanged letters until February 1987 and he also wrote a preface in July 1986 for the resulting book Filosofía y marxismo a collection of her interviews with Althusser that was released in Mexico in 1988. These interviews and correspondence were collected and published in France in 1994 as Sur la philosophie. In this period he formulated his materialism of the encounter or aleatory materialism talking to Breton and Navarro about it that first appeared in Écrits philosophiques et politiques I and later in the 2006 Verso book Philosophy of the Encounter. In 1987 after Althusser underwent an emergency operation because of the obstruction of the esophagus he developed a new clinical case of depression. First brought to the Soisy-sur-Seine clinic he was transferred to the psychiatric institution MGEN in La Verrière. There following a pneumonia contracted during the summer he died of a heart attack on 22 October 1990.

Althusser was such a homebody that biographer William S. Lewis affirmed Althusser had known only home school and P.O.W. camp by the time he met his future wife. In contrast when he first met Rytmann in 1946 she was a former member of the French resistance and a Communist activist. After fighting along with Jean Beaufret in the group Service Périclès she joined the PCF. However she was expelled from the party accused of being a double agent for Gestapo for Trotskyist deviation and crimes which probably referred to the execution of former Nazi collaborators. Although high-ranking party officials instructed him to sever relations with Rytmann Althusser tried to restore her reputation in the PCF for a long time by making inquiries into her wartime activities. Although he did not succeed in reinserting her into the party his relationship with Rytmann nonetheless deepened during this period. Their relationship was traumatic from the outset so Althusser claims wrote Elliott. Among the reasons were his almost total inexperience with women and the fact she was eight years older than him.

I had never embraced a woman and above all I had never been embraced by a woman . Desire mounted in me we made love on the bed it was new exciting exalting and violent. When she had left an abysm of anguish opened up in me never again to close.

His feelings toward her were contradictory from the very beginning; it is suggested that the strong emotional impact she caused in him led him to deep depression. Roudinesco wrote that for Althusser Rytmann represented the opposite of himself she had been in the Resistance while he was remote from the anti-Nazi combat; she was a Jew who carried the stamp of the Holocaust whereas he despite his conversion to Marxism never escaped the formative effect of Catholicism; she suffered under Stalinism at the very moment when he was joining the party; and in opposition to his petit-bourgeois background her childhood was not prosperousat the age of 13 she became the sexual abuse victim of a family doctor who in addition instructed her to give her terminally ill parents a dose of morphine. According to Roudinesco she embodied for Althusser his displaced conscience pitiless superego damned part black animality.

Althusser considered that Rytmann gave him a world of solidarity and struggle a world of reasoned action... a world of courage. According to him they performed an indispensable maternal and paternal function for one another She loved me as a mother loves a child... and at the same time like a good father in that she introduced me... to the real world that vast arena I had never been able to enter.... Through her desire for me she also initiated me... into my role as a man into my masculinity. She loved me as a woman loves a man Roudinesco argued that Rytmann represented for him the sublimated figure of his own hated mother to whom he remained attached all his life. In his autobiography he wrote If I was dazzled by Hélènes love and the miraculous privilege of knowing her and having her in my life I tried to give that back to her in my own way intensely and if I may put it this way as a religious offering as I had done for my mother.

Although Althusser was really in love with Rytmann he also had affairs with other women. Roudinesco commented that unlike Hélène the other women loved by Louis Althusser were generally of great physical beauty and sometimes exceptionally sensitive to intellectual dialogue. She gives as an example of the latter case a woman named Claire Z. with whom he had a long relationship until he was forty-two. They broke up when he met Franca Madonia a philosopher translator and playwright from a well-off Italian bourgeois family from Romagna. Madonia was married to Mino whose sister Giovanna was married to the Communist painter Leonardo Cremonini. Every summer the two families gathered in a residence in the village of Bertinoro and according to Roudinesco It was in this magical setting... that Louis Althusser fell in love with Franca discovering through her everything he had missed in his own childhood and that he lacked in Paris a real family an art of living a new manner of thinking speaking desiring. She influenced him to appreciate modern theatre and Roudinesco wrote also on his detachment of Stalinism and his finest texts but also his most important concepts. In her company in Italy in 1961 as Elliott affirmed was also when he truly discovered Machiavelli. Between 1961 and 1965 they exchanged letters and telephone calls and they also went on trips together in which they talk about the current events politics and theory as well made confidences on the happiness and unhappiness of daily life. However Madonia had an explosive reaction when Althusser tried to make her Rytmanns friend and seek to bring Mino into their meetings. They nevertheless continued to exchange letters until 1973; these were published in 1998 into an 800-page book Lettres à Franca.

Althusser underwent psychiatric hospitalisations throughout his life the first time after receiving a diagnosis of schizophrenia. He suffered from bipolar disorder and because of it he had frequent bouts of depression that started in 1938 and became regular after his five-year stay in German captivity. From the 1950s onward he was under constant medical supervision often undergoing in Lewis words the most aggressive treatments post-war French psychiatry had to offer which included electroconvulsive therapy narco-analysis and psychoanalysis. Althusser did not limit himself to prescribed medications and practised self-medication. The disease affected his academic productivity; in 1962 he began to write a book about Machiavelli during a depressive exacerbation but was interrupted by a three-months stay in a clinic. The main psychoanalyst he attended was the anti-Lacanian René Diatkine starting from 1964 after he had a dream about killing his own sister. The sessions became more frequent in January 1965 and the real work of exploring the unconscious was launched in June. Soon Althusser recognized the positive side of non-Lacanian psychoanalysis; although sometimes tried to ridicule Diatkine giving him lessons in Lacanianism by July 1966 he considered the treatment was producing spectacular results. In 1976 Althusser estimated that he had spent fifteen of the previous thirty years in hospitals and psychiatric clinics.

Althusser analysed the prerequisites of his illness with the help of psychoanalysis and found them in complex relationships with his family . Althusser believed that he did not have a genuine I which was caused by the absence of real maternal love and the fact that his father was emotionally reserved and virtually absent for his son. Althusser deduced the family situation from the events before his birth as told to him by his aunt Lucienne Berger his mother was to marry his fathers brother Louis Althusser who died in World War I near Verdun while Charles his father was engaged with Luciennes sister Juliette. Both families followed the old custom of the levirate which obliged an older still unmarried brother to wed the widow of a deceased younger brother. Lucienne then married Charles and the son was named after the deceased Louis. In Althussers memoirs this marriage was madness not so much because of the tradition itself but because of the excessive submission as Charles was not forced to marry Lucienne since his younger brother had not yet married her. As a result Althusser concluded his mother did not love him but loved the long-dead Louis. The philosopher described his mother as a castrating mother who under the influence of her phobias established a strict regime of social and sexual hygiene for Althusser and his sister Georgette. His feeling of fathomless solitude could only be mitigated by communicating with his mothers parents who lived in Morvan. His relationship with his mother and the desire to deserve her love in his memoirs largely determined his adult life and career including his admission to the ENS and his desire to become a well-known intellectual. According to his autobiography ENS was for Althusser a kind of refuge of intellectual purity from the big dirty world that his mother was so afraid of.

The facts of his autobiography have been critically evaluated by researchers. According to its own editors Lavenir dure longtemps is an inextricable tangle of facts and phantasies. His friend and biographer Yann Moulier-Boutang after a careful analysis of the early period of Althussers life concluded that the autobiography was a re-writing of a life through the prism of its wreckage. Moulier-Boutang believed that it was Rytmann who played a key role in creating a fatalistic account of the history of the Althusser family largely shaping his vision in a 1964 letter. According to Elliott the autobiography produces primarily an impression of destructiveness and self-destructiveness. Althusser most likely postdated the beginning of his depression to a later period having not mentioned earlier manifestations of the disease in school and in the concentration camp. According to Moulier-Boutang Althusser had a close psychological connection with Georgette from an early age and although he did not often mention it in his autobiography her nervous illness may have tracked his own. His sister also had depression and despite the fact that they lived separately from each other for almost their entire adult lives their depression often coincided in time. Also Althusser focused on describing family circumstances not considering for example the influence of ENS on his personality. Moulier-Boutang connected the depression not only with events in his personal life but also with political disappointments.

Althussers earlier works include the influential volume Reading Capital which collects the work of Althusser and his students in an intensive philosophical rereading of Marxs Capital. The book reflects on the philosophical status of Marxist theory as a critique of political economy and on its object. Althusser would later acknowledge that many of the innovations in this interpretation of Marx attempt to assimilate concepts derived from Baruch Spinoza into Marxism.The original English translation of this work includes only the essays of Althusser and Étienne Balibar while the original French edition contains additional contributions from Jacques Rancière Pierre Macherey and Roger Establet. A full translation was published in 2016.

Several of Althussers theoretical positions have remained influential in Marxist philosophy. His essay On the Materialist Dialectic proposes a great epistemological break between Marxs early writings and his later properly Marxist texts borrowing a term from the philosopher of science Gaston Bachelard. His essay Marxism and Humanism is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory condemning ideas like human potential and species-being which are often put forth by Marxists as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of humanity. His essay Contradiction and Overdetermination borrows the concept of overdetermination from psychoanalysis in order to replace the idea of contradiction with a more complex model of multiple causality in political situations .

Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology. His best-known essay Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses Notes Toward an Investigation establishes the concept of ideology. Althussers theory of ideology draws on Marx and Gramsci but also on Freuds and Lacans psychological concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that enable the concept of self. For Althusser these structures are both agents of repression and inevitable it is impossible to escape ideology and avoid being subjected to it. On the other hand the collection of essays from which Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses is drawn contains other essays which confirm that Althussers concept of ideology is broadly consistent with the classic Marxist theory of class struggle.

Althussers thought evolved during his lifetime. It has been the subject of argument and debate especially within Marxism and specifically concerning his theory of knowledge .

Althusser argues that Marxs thought has been fundamentally misunderstood and underestimated. He fiercely condemns various interpretations of Marxs workshistoricismidealism and economismon grounds that they fail to realize that with the science of history historical materialism Marx has constructed a revolutionary view of social change. Althusser believes these errors result from the notion that Marxs entire body of work can be understood as a coherent whole. Rather Marxs thought contains a radical epistemological break. Although the works of the young Marx are bound by the categories of German philosophy and classical political economy The German Ideology makes a sudden and unprecedented departure. This break represents a shift in Marxs work to a fundamentally different problematic i.e. a different set of central propositions and questions posed a different theoretical framework. Althusser believes that Marx himself did not fully comprehend the significance of his own work and was able to express it only obliquely and tentatively. The shift can be revealed only by a careful and sensitive symptomatic reading. Thus Althussers project is to help readers fully grasp the originality and power of Marxs extraordinary theory giving as much attention to what is not said as to the explicit. Althusser holds that Marx has discovered a continent of knowledge History analogous to the contributions of Thales to mathematics or Galileo to physics in that the structure of his theory is unlike anything posited by his predecessors.

Althusser believes that Marxs work is fundamentally incompatible with its antecedents because it is built on a groundbreaking epistemology that rejects the distinction between subject and object. In opposition to empiricism Althusser claims that Marxs philosophy dialectical materialism counters the theory of knowledge as vision with a theory of knowledge as production. On the empiricist view a knowing subject encounters a real object and uncovers its essence by means of abstraction. On the assumption that thought has a direct engagement with reality or an unmediated vision of a real object the empiricist believes that the truth of knowledge lies in the correspondence of a subjects thought to an object that is external to thought itself. By contrast Althusser claims to find latent in Marxs work a view of knowledge as theoretical practice. For Althusser theoretical practice takes place entirely within the realm of thought working upon theoretical objects and never coming into direct contact with the real object that it aims to know. Knowledge is not discovered but rather produced by way of three Generalities the raw material of pre-scientific ideas abstractions and facts; a conceptual framework brought to bear upon these; and the finished product of a transformed theoretical entity concrete knowledge. In this view the validity of knowledge does not lie in its correspondence to something external to itself. Marxs historical materialism is a science with its own internal methods of proof. It is therefore not governed by interests of society class ideology or politics and is distinct from the superstructure.

In addition to its unique epistemology Marxs theory is built on conceptssuch as forces and relations of productionthat have no counterpart in classical political economy. Even when existing terms are adoptedfor example the theory of surplus value which combines David Ricardos concepts of rent profit and interesttheir meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different. However more fundamental to Marxs break is a rejection of homo economicus or the idea held by the classical economists that the needs of individuals can be treated as a fact or given independent of any economic organization. For the classical economists individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a mode of production and as an independent starting point for a theory about society. Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs Marxs analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently Marxs Capital has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althussers view Marx does not merely argue that human needs are largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather he abandons the very idea that there can be a theory about what people are like that is prior to any theory about how they come to be that way.

Although Althusser insists that there was an epistemological break he later states that its occurrence around 1845 is not clearly defined as traces of humanism historicism and Hegelianism are found in Capital. He states that only Marxs Critique of the Gotha Programme and some marginal notes on a book by Adolph Wagner are fully free from humanist ideology. In line with this Althusser replaces his earlier definition of Marxs philosophy as the theory of theoretical practice with a new belief in politics in the field of history and class struggle in theory. Althusser considers the epistemological break to be a process instead of a clearly defined event the product of incessant struggle against ideology. Thus the distinction between ideology and science or philosophy is not assured once and for all by the epistemological break.

Because of Marxs belief that the individual is a product of society Althusser holds that it is pointless to try to build a social theory on a prior conception of the individual. The subject of observation is not individual human elements but rather structure. As he sees it Marx does not explain society by appealing to the properties of individual personstheir beliefs desires preferences and judgements. Rather Marx defines society as a set of fixed practices. Individuals are not actors who make their own history but are instead the supports of these practices.

Althusser uses this analysis to defend Marxs historical materialism against the charge that it crudely posits a base and superstructure rising upon it and then attempts to explain all aspects of the superstructure by appealing to features of the base . For Althusser it is a mistake to attribute this economic determinist view to Marx. Just as Althusser criticises the idea that a social theory can be founded on an historical conception of human needs so does he reject the idea that economic practice can be used in isolation to explain other aspects of society. Althusser believes that the base and the superstructure are interdependent although he keeps to the classic Marxist materialist understanding of the determination of the base in the last instance . The advantage of practices over human individuals as a starting point is that although each practice is only a part of a complex whole of society a practice is a whole in itself in that it consists of a number of different kinds of parts. Economic practice for example contains raw materials tools individual persons etc. all united in a process of production.

Althusser conceives of society as an interconnected collection of these wholes economic practice ideological practice and politico-legal practice. Although each practice has a degree of relative autonomy together they make up one complex structured whole . In his view all practices are dependent on each other. For example among the relations of production of capitalist societies are the buying and selling of labour power by capitalists and workers respectively. These relations are part of economic practice but can only exist within the context of a legal system which establishes individual agents as buyers and sellers. Furthermore the arrangement must be maintained by political and ideological means. From this it can be seen that aspects of economic practice depend on the superstructure and vice versa. For him this was the moment of reproduction and constituted the important role of the superstructure.

An analysis understood in terms of interdependent practices helps us to conceive of how society is organized but also permits us to comprehend social change and thus provides a theory of history. Althusser explains the reproduction of the relations of production by reference to aspects of ideological and political practice; conversely the emergence of new production relations can be explained by the failure of these mechanisms. Marxs theory seems to posit a system in which an imbalance in two parts could lead to compensatory adjustments at other levels or sometimes to a major reorganization of the whole. To develop this idea Althusser relies on the concepts of contradiction and non-contradiction which he claims are illuminated by their relation to a complex structured whole. Practices are contradictory when they grate on one another and non-contradictory when they support one another. Althusser elaborates on these concepts by reference to Lenins analysis of the Russian Revolution of 1917.

Lenin posited that despite widespread discontent throughout Europe in the early 20th century Russia was the country in which revolution occurred because it contained all the contradictions possible within a single state at the time. In his words it was the weakest link in a chain of imperialist states. He explained the revolution in relation to two groups of circumstances firstly the existence within Russia of large-scale exploitation in cities mining districts etc. a disparity between urban industrialization and medieval conditions in the countryside and a lack of unity amongst the ruling class; secondly a foreign policy which played into the hands of revolutionaries such as the elites who had been exiled by the Tsar and had become sophisticated socialists.

For Althusser this example reinforces his claim that Marxs explanation of social change is more complex than the result of a single contradiction between the forces and the relations of production. The differences between events in Russia and Western Europe highlight that a contradiction between forces and relations of production may be necessary but not sufficient to bring about revolution. The circumstances that produced revolution in Russia were heterogeneous and cannot be seen to be aspects of one large contradiction. Each was a contradiction within a particular social totality. From this Althusser concludes that Marxs concept of contradiction is inseparable from the concept of a complex structured social whole. To emphasize that changes in social structures relate to numerous contradictions Althusser describes these changes as overdetermined using a term taken from Sigmund Freud. This interpretation allows us to account for the way in which many different circumstances may play a part in the course of events and how these circumstances may combine to produce unexpected social changes or ruptures.

However Althusser does not mean to say that the events that determine social changes all have the same causal status. While a part of a complex whole economic practice is a structure in dominance it plays a major part in determining the relations between other spheres and has more effect on them than they have on it. The most prominent aspect of society is called the dominant instance and is in turn determined in the last instance by the economy. For Althusser the economic practice of a society determines which other formation of that society dominates the society as a whole.

Althussers understanding of contradiction in terms of the dialectic attempts to rid Marxism of the influence and vestiges of Hegelian dialectics and is a component part of his general anti-humanist position. In his reading the Marxist understanding of social totality is not to be confused with the Hegelian. Where Hegel sees the different features of each historical epoch its art politics religion etc. as expressions of a single essence Althusser believes each social formation to be decentred i.e. that it cannot be reduced or simplified to a unique central point.

Because Althusser held that a persons desires choices intentions preferences judgements and so forth are the effects of social practices he believed it necessary to conceive of how society makes the individual in its own image. Within capitalist societies the human individual is generally regarded as a subjecta self-conscious responsible agent whose actions can be explained by their beliefs and thoughts. For Althusser a persons capacity to perceive themselves in this way is not innate. Rather it is acquired within the structure of established social practices which impose on individuals the role of a subject. Social practices both determine the characteristics of the individual and give them an idea of the range of properties they can have and of the limits of each individual. Althusser argues that many of our roles and activities are given to us by social practice for example the production of steelworkers is a part of economic practice while the production of lawyers is part of politico-legal practice. However other characteristics of individuals such as their beliefs about the good life or their metaphysical reflections on the nature of the self do not easily fit into these categories.

In Althussers view our values desires and preferences are inculcated in us by ideological practice the sphere which has the defining property of constituting individuals as subjects. Ideological practice consists of an assortment of institutions called ideological state apparatuses which include the family the media religious organizations and most importantly in capitalist societies the education system as well as the received ideas that they propagate. No single ISA produces in us the belief that we are self-conscious agents. Instead we derive this belief in the course of learning what it is to be a daughter a schoolchild black a steelworker a councillor and so forth.

Despite its many institutional forms the function and structure of ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states ideology has no history. All ideologies constitute a subject even though he or she may differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably Althusser illustrates this with the concept of hailing or interpellation. He compares ideology to a policeman shouting Hey you there toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call the person responds by turning around and in doing so is transformed into a subject. The person being hailed recognizes themselves as the subject of the hail and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a mis-recognition because it works retroactively a material individual is always already an ideological subject even before he or she is born. The transformation of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinozas theory of immanence.

To highlight this Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology embodied in the Voice of God instructing a person on what their place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with Christ. From this Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian he must first already be a subject; that is by responding to Gods call and following His rules he affirms himself as a free agent the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology and in fact our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. Althussers theory draws heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stagewe acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.

While Althussers writings were born of an intervention against reformist and ecumenical tendencies within Marxist theory the eclecticism of his influences reflected a move away from the intellectual isolation of the Stalin era. He drew as much from pre-Marxist systems of thought and contemporary schools such as structuralism philosophy of science and psychoanalysis as he did from thinkers in the Marxist tradition. Furthermore his thought was symptomatic of Marxisms growing academic respectability and of a push towards emphasizing Marxs legacy as a philosopher rather than only as an economist or sociologist. Tony Judt saw this as a criticism of Althussers work saying he removed Marxism altogether from the realm of history politics and experience and thereby ... render it invulnerable to any criticism of the empirical sort.

Althusser has had broad influence in the areas of Marxist philosophy and post-structuralism interpellation has been popularized and adapted by the feminist philosopher and critic Judith Butler and elaborated further by Göran Therborn; the concept of ideological state apparatuses has been of interest to Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek; the attempt to view history as a process without a subject garnered sympathy from Jacques Derrida; historical materialism was defended as a coherent doctrine from the standpoint of analytic philosophy by G.A. Cohen; the interest in structure and agency sparked by Althusser was to play a role in Anthony Giddenss theory of structuration.

Althussers influence is also seen in the work of economists Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick who have interpreted that Marxs mature works hold a conception of class different from the normally understood ones. For them in Marx class refers not to a group of people but to a process involving the production appropriation and distribution of surplus labour. Their emphasis on class as a process is consistent with their reading and use of Althussers concept of overdetermination in terms of understanding agents and objects as the site of multiple determinations.

Althussers work has also been criticized from a number of angles. In a 1971 paper for Socialist Register Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points

I will argue that the whole of Althussers theory is made up of the following elements 1. common sense banalities expressed with the help of unnecessarily complicated neologisms; 2. traditional Marxist concepts that are vague and ambiguous in Marx himself and which remain after Althussers explanation exactly as vague and ambiguous as they were before; 3. some striking historical inexactitudes.

Kołakowski further argued that despite Althussers claims of scientific rigour structural Marxism was unfalsifiable and thus unscientific and was best understood as a quasi-religious ideology. In 1980 sociologist Axel van den Berg described Kołakowskis critique as devastating proving that Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts.

G.A. Cohen in his essay Complete Bullshit has cited the Althusserian school as an example of bullshit and a factor in his co-founding the Non-Bullshit Marxism Group. He says that the ideas that the Althusserians generated for example of the interpellation of the subject or of contradiction and overdetermination possessed a surface allure but it often seemed impossible to determine whether or not the theses in which those ideas figured were true and at other times those theses seemed capable of just two interpretations on one of them they were true but uninteresting and on the other they were interesting but quite obviously false.

Althusser was violently attacked by British Marxist historian E. P. Thompson in his book The Poverty of Theory. Thompson claimed that Althusserianism was Stalinism reduced to the paradigm of a theory. Where the Soviet doctrines that existed during the lifetime of the dictator lacked systematisation Althussers theory gave Stalinism its true rigorous and totally coherent expression. As such Thompson called for unrelenting intellectual war against the Marxism of Althusser.

Since his death the reassessment of Althussers work and influence has been ongoing. The first wave of retrospective critiques and interventions began outside of Althussers own country France because as Étienne Balibar pointed out in 1988 there is an absolute taboo now suppressing the name of this man and the meaning of his writings. Balibars remarks were made at the Althusserian Legacy Conference organized at Stony Brook University by Michael Sprinker. The proceedings of this conference were published in September 1992 as the Althusserian Legacy and included contributions from Balibar Alex Callinicos Michele Barrett Alain Lipietz Warren Montag and Gregory Elliott among others. It also included an obituary and an extensive interview with Derrida.

Eventually a colloquium was organized in France at the University of Paris VIII by Sylvain Lazarus on May 27 1992. The general title was Politique et philosophie dans loeuvre de Louis Althusser the proceedings of which were published in 1993.

In retrospect Althussers continuing influence can be seen through his students. A dramatic example of this points to the editors and contributors of the 1960s journal Cahiers pour lAnalyse In many ways the Cahiers can be read as the critical development of Althussers own intellectual itinerary when it was at its most robust. This influence continues to guide much philosophical work as many of these same students became eminent intellectuals in the 1960s 1970s 1980s and 1990s Alain Badiou Étienne Balibar and Jacques Rancière in philosophy Pierre Macherey in literary criticism and Nicos Poulantzas in sociology. The prominent Guevarist Régis Debray also studied under Althusser as did the aforementioned Derrida noted philosopher Michel Foucault and the pre-eminent Lacanian psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller.

Badiou has lectured and spoken on Althusser on several occasions in France Brazil and Austria since Althussers death. Badiou has written many studies including Althusser Subjectivity without a Subject published in his book Metapolitics in 2005. Most recently Althussers work has been given prominence again through the interventions of Warren Montag and his circle; see for example the special issue of borderlands e-journal edited by David McInerney and Décalages An Althusser Studies Journal edited by Montag. 

In 2011 Althusser continued to spark controversy and debate with the publication in August of that year of Jacques Rancières first book Althussers Lesson . It marked the first time this groundbreaking work was to appear in its entirety in an English translation. In 2014 On the Reproduction of Capitalism was published which is an English translation of the full text of the work from which the ISAs text was drawn.

The publication of Althussers posthumous memoir cast some doubt on his own scholarly practices. For example although he owned thousands of books Althusser revealed that he knew very little about Kant Spinoza and Hegel. While he was familiar with Marxs early works he had not read Capital when he wrote his own most important Marxist texts. Additionally Althusser had contrived to impress his first teacher the Catholic theologian Jean Guitton with a paper whose guiding principles he had simply filched from Guittons own corrections of a fellow students essay and he concocted fake quotations in the thesis he wrote for another major contemporary philosopher Gaston Bachelard."
Bernard Andrieu,"Bernard Andrieu is a French philosopher and historian of the body.

Andrieu studied in Bordeaux from 1978 to 1984. He is a professor at the University of Nancy.He has written on the philosophy of neuroscience and the mind-body problem as well as the history of bodily practices such as tanning touch the open air and immersion. He is the editor of a 450-article Dictionary of the Body."
Anselm of Laon,"Anselm of Laon properly Ansel was a French theologian and founder of a school of scholars who helped to pioneer biblical hermeneutics.

Born of very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th century he is said to have studied under Saint Anselm at Bec though this is almost certainly incorrect. Other potential teachers of Anselm have been identified including Bruno of Cologne and Manegold of Lautenbach. By around 1080 he had moved back to his place of birth and was teaching at the cathedral school of Laon with his brother Ralph. Around 1109 he became dean and chancellor of the cathedral and in 1115 he was one of Laons two archdeacons.

The Liber Pancrisi names him with his brother Ralph Ivo of Chartres and William of Champeaux as one of the four modern masters.

Anselms greatest work an interlinear and marginal gloss on the Scriptures the Glossa ordinaria now attributed to him and his followers was one of the great intellectual achievements of the Middle Ages. It has been frequently reprinted. The significance of the gloss which was most likely assembled after Anselms death by his students such as Gilbert de la Porrée and based on Anselms teaching is that it marked a new way of learning it represented the birth of efforts to present discrete patristic and earlier medieval interpretations of individual verses of Scripture in a readily accessible easily referenced way. This theme was subsequently adopted and extended by the likes of Hugh of St. Victor Peter Lombard and later Thomas Aquinas who gave us handbooks for what we would now call theology.

Other commentaries apparently by Anselm have been ascribed to various writers principally to Anselm of Canterbury.

The works are collected in Migne. Some of his Sententiae were edited at Milan by G. Lefevre in 1894. The commentary on the Psalms attributed to Haymo of Halberstadt by Migne has also been identified as possibly being the work of Anselm."
Antoine Arnauld,"Antoine Arnauld was a French Catholic theologian philosopher and mathematician. He was one of the leading intellectuals of the Jansenist group of Port-Royal and had a very thorough knowledge of patristics. Contemporaries called him le Grand to distinguish him from his father.

Antoine Arnauld was born in Paris to the Arnauld family. The twentieth and youngest child of the original Antoine Arnauld he was originally intended for the bar but decided instead to study theology at the Sorbonne. Here he was brilliantly successful and his career was flourishing when he came under the influence of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne the spiritual director and leader of the convent of Port-Royal and was drawn in the direction of Jansenism.

His book De la fréquente Communion was an important step in making the aims and ideals of this movement intelligible to the general public. It attracted controversy by being against frequent communion. Furthermore in the frame of the controversy around Jansenius Augustinus during which the Jesuits attacked the Jansenists claiming they were heretics similar to Calvinists Arnauld wrote in defense the Théologie morale des Jésuites which would put the base of most of the arguments later used by Pascal in his Provincial Letters denouncing the relaxed moral of Jesuit casuistry. Pascal was assisted in this task by Arnaulds nephew Antoine Le Maistre. The Jesuit Nicolas Caussin former penitentiary to Louis XIII was charged by his order of writing a defense against Arnaulds book titled Réponse au libelle intitulé La Théologie morale des Jésuites . Other libels published against Arnaulds Moral Theology of Jesuits included the one written by the Jesuit polemist François Pinthereau under the pseudonym of the abbé de Boisic titled Les Impostures et les ignorances du libelle intitulé La Théologie Morale des Jésuites who was also the author of a critical history of Jansenism titled La Naissance du Jansénisme découverte à Monsieur le Chancelier .

During the formulary controversy which opposed Jesuits to Jansenists concerning the orthodoxy of Jansenius propositions Arnauld was forced to go into hiding. In 1655 two very outspoken Lettres à un duc et pair on Jesuit methods in the confessional brought a motion of censorship voted against him in the Sorbonne in quite an irregular manner. This motion prompted Pascal to anonymously write the Provincial Letters. For more than twenty years Arnauld dared not appear publicly in Paris hiding in religious retreat.

Pascal however failed to save his friend and in February 1656 Arnauld was ceremonially degraded. Twelve years later the so-called peace of Pope Clement IX put an end to his troubles; he was graciously received by Louis XIV and treated almost as a popular hero.

He now set to work with Pierre Nicole on a great work against the Calvinist Protestants La perpétuité de la foi de lÉglise catholique touchant leucharistie. Ten years later however persecution resumed. Arnauld was compelled to leave France for the Netherlands finally settling down at Brussels. Here the last sixteen years of his life were spent in incessant controversy with Jesuits Calvinists and heretics of all kinds. Arnauld gradually evolved away from the rigorous Augustinianism professed by Port-Royal and closer to Thomism which also postulated the centrality of the efficacious grace under the influence of Nicole.

His inexhaustible energy is best expressed by his famous reply to Nicole who complained of feeling tired. Tired echoed Arnauld when you have all eternity to rest in Next Arnauld was engaged in an extensive correspondence with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz regarding the latters views detailed in his Discourse on Metaphysics . Arnauld died aged 82 in Brussels.

Popular record for Arnaulds penetration was much increased in his LArt de penser commonly known as the Port-Royal Logic which kept its place as an elementary text-book until the 20th century and is considered a paradigmatical work of term logic.

Arnauld came to be regarded as important among the mathematicians of his time; one critic described him as the Euclid of the 17th century. After his death his reputation began to wane. Contemporaries admired him as a master of intricate reasoning; on this Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet the greatest theologian of the age agreed with Henri François dAguesseau the greatest lawyer. However his eagerness to win every argument endeared him to no one. In spite of myself Arnauld once said regretfully my books are seldom very short.. Despite Arnaulds achievements in various fields his name is mostly known because of Pascals acclaimed writings which were more fit for the general public than Arnaulds technical essays. Boileau wrote for him a famous epitaph consecrating his memory as

Antoine Arnaulds complete works were published in Paris 17751781. There is a study of his philosophy in Francisque Bouillier Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne ; and his mathematical achievements are discussed by Franz Bopp in the 14th volume of the Abhandlung zur Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften ."
Raymond Aron,"Raymond Claude Ferdinand Aron was a French philosopher sociologist political scientist and journalist one of the countrys most prominent thinkers of the 20th century.

Aron is best known for his 1955 book The Opium of the Intellectuals the title of which inverts Karl Marxs claim that religion was the opium of the people; he argues that Marxism was the opium of the intellectuals in post-war France. In the book Aron chastised French intellectuals for what he described as their harsh criticism of capitalism and democracy and their simultaneous defense of Marxist oppression atrocities and intolerance. Critic Roger Kimball suggests that Opium is a seminal book of the twentieth century. Aron is also known for his lifelong friendship sometimes fractious with philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. The saying Better be wrong with Sartre than right with Aron became popular among French intellectuals.

As a voice of moderation in politics Aron had many disciples on both the political left and right but he remarked that he personally was more of a left-wing Aronian than a right-wing one. However he is generally referred to as a conservative liberal . Aron wrote extensively on a wide range of other topics. Citing the breadth and quality of Arons writings historian James R. Garland suggests Though he may be little known in America Raymond Aron arguably stood as the preeminent example of French intellectualism for much of the twentieth century.

Born in Paris the son of a secular Jewish lawyer Aron studied at the École Normale Supérieure where he met Jean-Paul Sartre who became his friend and lifelong intellectual opponent. He was a rational humanist and a leader among those who did not embrace existentialism. Aron took first place in the agrégation of philosophy in 1928 the year Sartre failed the same exam. In 1930 he received a doctorate in the philosophy of history from the École Normale Supérieure.

He had been teaching social philosophy at the University of Toulouse for only a few weeks when World War II began; he joined the Armée de lAir. When France was defeated he left for London to join the Free French forces editing the newspaper France Libre .

When the war ended Aron returned to Paris to teach sociology at the École Nationale dAdministration and Sciences Po. From 1955 to 1968 he taught at the Sorbonne and after 1970 at the Collège de France as well as the École des hautes études en sciences sociales . In 1953 he befriended the young American philosopher Allan Bloom who was teaching at the Sorbonne.

A lifelong journalist Aron in 1947 became an influential columnist for Le Figaro a position he held for thirty years until he joined LExpress where he wrote a political column up to his death.

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960.

In 1978 he founded Commentaire a quarterly journal of ideas and debate together with Jean-Claude Casanova who was the ventures founding director.

Aron died of a heart attack in Paris on 17 October 1983.

In Berlin Aron witnessed the rise to power of the Nazi Party and developed an aversion to all totalitarian systems. In 1938 he participated in the Colloque Walter Lippmann in Paris. By the 1950s he had grown very critical of the Austrian School and described their obsession with private property as an inverted Marxism. Aron always promoted an immoderately moderate form of liberalism which accepted a mixed economy as the normal economic model of the age.

Aron is the author of books on Karl Marx and on Carl von Clausewitz. In Peace and War he set out a theory of international relations. He argues that Max Webers claim that the state has a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force does not apply to the relationship between states.

In the field of international relations in the 1950s Aron hypothesized that despite the advent of nuclear weapons nations would still require conventional military forces. The usefulness of such forces would be made necessary by what he called a nuclear taboo.

A prolific author he wrote several thousand editorials and several hundred academic articles essays and comments as well as about forty books which include"
Gwenaëlle Aubry,"Gwenaëlle Aubry is a French novelist and philosopher.

After two years of preparatory classes at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris Aubry began her studies at the École Normale Supérieure in 1989 at the age of eighteen earning an agrégation in Philosophy in 1992. She then received the Knox Scholarship at Trinity College Cambridge where she earned a Master of Philosophy. In 1999 she received a Doctorate in Philosophy from the Université de Paris IV-Sorbonne.

She was a lecturer in ancient philosophy at the Université de Nancy II from 1999 to 2002. She now serves as a Director of Research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique . She is also a member of the reading committee at the Théâtre national de la Colline. She is married to the philosopher Quentin Meillassoux.

She published her first novel Le Diable détacheur in 1999.

In 2007 after a residence at the Villa Medici she published Notre vie suse en transfigurations excerpts of which were staged by Sarah Oppenheim for the play Donnez-moi donc un corps put on in 2017 by the Théâtre du Soleil.

In 2009 Aubry received the Prix Femina for Personne an alphabet-novel which is a portrait of a melancholic from twenty-six angles with nothing at the center. The book was also short-listed for the Prix Médicis the Grand Prix du Roman de lAcadémie française the Prix Novembre and the Prix de Flore. It has been translated into a dozen languages and was published in the United States as No One in Trista Selouss translation with a preface by Rick Moody.

In 2012 Partages came out a book of hauntings which mirrors sometimes on alternating pages the voices of two young girls one Jewish the other Palestinian in Israel during the Second Intifada. It was long-listed for the Prix Goncourt and was a finalist for the Grand Prix du Roman de lAcadémie française.

In 2015 she published Lazare mon amour a prismatic portrait of Sylvia Plath in LUne et LAutre. She then adapted it into a play which was published separately in 2016.

In 2016 the autobiographical novel Perséphone 2014 came out. Performed by the author and accompanied by the guitarist Sébastien Martel the text was also staged by Anne Monfort on the occasion of the tenth Festival de Caves. Partial translations into English have appeared from Benjamin Eldon Stevens and from Wendeline A. Hardenberg .

In 2018 her novel La Folie Elisa was published. A staged version featuring Aubry guitarist Sébastien Martel and Judith Chemla was performed in November 2018.

Aubry produced a radio play adaptation of Hermann Brochs The Death of Virgil for France Culture and has written literary studies of Yves Bonnefoy W. G. Sebald and Georges Perec as well as short works published in magazines and journals particularly La Nouvelle Revue française. She is also the author of several books and a number of articles on ancient philosophy and its contemporary reception as well as a translator from ancient Greek . In 2018 Genèse du Dieu souverain. Archéologie de la puissance II was published the second volume following Dieu sans la puissance. The author rejected the first mover of Aristotle could ever have been the first principle of all things because it is solely able to attract entities capable of its imitation and declared to choose the potence of all beings described by Plotinus and Plato."
Nicholas of Autrecourt,"Nicholas of Autrecourt was a French medieval philosopher and Scholastic theologian.

Born in Autrecourt near Verdun he was educated at Paris and earned bachelors degrees in theology and law and a masters degree in arts. Nicholas is known principally for developing skepticism to extreme logical conclusions. He is sometimes considered the sole genuinely skeptic philosopher of medieval times. Nicholas founded his skeptical position on arguments that knowledge claims were not reducible to the first principle that is that it was not contradictory to deny them. His views have been compared to those of David Hume but it has been suggested that the similarities are superficial and there is no evidence Nicholas influenced Hume or other modern philosophers such as René Descartes. Whether Nicholas was committed to skepticism is unclear but on 19 May 1346 his views were condemned by Pope Clement VI as heretical. Nicholas was sentenced to burn his books publicly and recant which he did in Paris in 1347.

In the 14th century Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter space and time were all made up of indivisible atoms points and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of al-Ghazali suggest that Nicholas was familiar with the work of al-Ghazali who was known as Algazel in Europe either directly or indirectly through Averroes.

Much of the extant knowledge of Nicholas of Autrecourts epistemology derives from one letter written by magister Egidius to Nicholas and an excerpt from his letter in reply to Egidius and from nine letters written by Nicholas to the Franciscan theologian Bernardus Aretinus ; however only two of the nine letters survive. Some fragments of the lost letters are quoted in the records of the condemnatory proceedings against Nicholas. Almost nothing is known about these two correspondents."
Kostas Axelos,"Kostas Axelos was a Greek-French philosopher.

Axelos was born in Athens in 1924 to a doctor and a woman from an old Athenian bourgeois family and attended high school at the French Institute and the Varvakeio High School. He enrolled in the School of Law of the University of Athens in order to pursue studies in law and economics due to dissatisfaction with the philosophy taught at the School of Philosophy of the University of Athens but did not attend. With the onset of World War II Axelos got involved in politics. Then during the German and Italian occupation he participated in the Greek Resistance and later on in the prelude of the Greek Civil War as an organiser and journalist affiliated with the Communist Party . He was later expelled from the Communist Party and condemned to death by the right-wing government. He was arrested but managed to escape.

At the end of 1945 Axelos moved to Paris France on the Mataroa voyage with around 200 other persecuted intellectuals where he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and lived most of his life. From 1950 to 1957 he worked as a researcher in the philosophy branch of CRNS where he was writing his dissertations and subsequently proceeded to work in École Pratique des Hautes Études. From 1962 to 1973 Axelos taught philosophy at the Sorbonne and met Jacques Lacan Pablo Picasso and Martin Heidegger. His 1959 primary doctoral thesis Marx penseur de la technique tried to provide an understanding of modern technology based on the thought of Heidegger and Marx and was very influential in the 1960s alongside the philosophy of Herbert Marcuse. Axelos secondary thesis was on Heraclitus and was eventually published in 1962 as Héraclite et la philosophie La première saisie de lêtre en devenir de la totalité .

Axelos was a collaborator on columnist with and subsequently editor of the magazine Arguments . He founded and since 1960 has run the book series Arguments in Les Éditions de Minuit. The journal had links to other European publications e.g. Praxis in Yugoslavia and Das Argument in Germany and pursued a non-sectarian Marxist approach. He has published texts mostly in French but also in Greek and German. His most important book is Le Jeu du Monde where Axelos argues for a pre-ontological status of play. Because of this activity and connection to major European intellectual figures Axelos played a central role in French and European intellectual life for over 50 years.

Kostas Axelos tried to reconcile the ancient thinking of Heraclitus with the modern thinking of Marx Nietzsche Freud Heidegger and others in order to gain a new perspective on some of the problems of Marxism during his time. Axelos used Heraclitus philosophy as the primary basis for assessing the work of Marx and Engels. Axelos contributed to the growing interest of contemporary researchers in the Pre-Socratics and generally for ancient Greek philosophy through his reading of the role of concepts in interpreting the world.

Axelos starting point was the argument in Marxs thesis that the worlds becoming philosophical is at the same time philosophys becoming worldly that its realization is at the same time its loss In his dissertation Marx the Man Who Thinks Through Technique and in his work Alienation Techne and Praxis in the Thought of Karl Marx Axelos draws heavily on the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts reading them with the help of Heideggers and Nietzsches concepts. He explored the consequences of alienation in history such as the effects of the division of labor private property and capital in terms of the externalization of human beings in an alien reality. Axelos tried to relate these descriptions of alienation and loss of play to Heideggers concept of technological enframing as standing-reserve . For Axelos this expanded understanding of technology became a way of interrogating both modern society and Marxism

Following the example of his teacher Heidegger who employed a poetic style of philosophy Axelos often used a continuous flow of aphoristic statements to relate phenomena together attempting to listen to the game of the world. Using this method to approach the horizons of the world Axelos unpacks the mythological elements of Marxism and especially criticizes tendencies toward meta-narrative that he considers nihilistic and anthropocentric. Axelos two doctoral theses and his book Towards Planetary Thinking were arranged as a trilogyThe Unfolding of Errance.

Axelos continued to engage with contemporary thinking and the emerging global world by seeking to discover the unseen horizon encircling all things further refining his method as a continuous wandering through the splintered wholeness that surrounds contemporary human beings. To describe this state of being-in-becoming Axelos uses the term the game. This is the basis of Axelos second trilogy entitled The Unfolding of the Game which includes the books The Game of the World Towards an Ethics of Problematics and Contribution to Logic .

Finally Axelos third trilogy is entitled The Unfolding of an Investigation and consists of the books Arguments of an Investigation Horizons of the World and Issues at Stake . In employing both Marx and Freud Axelos did not carelessly reject their arguments despite trying to liberate the vital forces within them as his autobiography notes it remains to ask again to extrapolate the Marxian and Freudian intuitions . The focus of the searches is still the set-game of sets especially in the context of the end of history debates. This is restated as follows Since everything has been said and contradicted in a specific language mainly the metaphysical language of philosophy and the language of anti-philosophy that subverts the metaphysical is there is still something of meaning to say and in what language .

After completion of the third trilogy Axelos published Open Systems as an extension of the concepts that he had hitherto employed on exposures in the world with a means of capturing and writing also the different and enormous wanderings of the open world i.e. what is not present-at-hand but what is overwhelming more people and more historical societies.

Axelos texts were almost all written as meta-philosophical epilogues with the intention not to passively endure our time the inquiries that we have launched require us to look and see both near and far . The ultimate goal was to write in a speech poetic and thoughtful a fervent life .

Axelos approach to thinking and philosophizing can be called Open Marxism a term Axelos himself has used. However Axelos identified aspects of modern technological thinking that needed to be criticized within Marxs texts leading him to read Marx as the culminating figure of Western metaphysics . Open Marxism is therefore an attempt to transcend the political-ideological role of Marxism and to instead pose fruitful questions and demystify existing realizations. Axelos stressed that all kinds of action - political or otherwise - cannot be defined a priori. Axelos thought attempts to question all forms of closure and is a form of open systems theory . Elsewhere he called this planetary thinking .

Axelos uses the concept of play both as an ontological category and as an ethical ideal for an unalienated society. Axelos argues following Marx that the opposition between work and play needs to be abolished but recognizes that this would be both a concrete and ontological world-play or errance. He also argues following Heidegger that play is the meaning of Being which has been forgotten in the modern world . Critiquing overly determinist accounts of globalization for example Axelos argues that it is a process of world-forming which is more open to transformation than classical Marxists theorists often admit. The relational aspect of play is what links human activity with the activity of the world and the various systems of human life together and to the world. Thus play is not at all a childish vocation for Axelos.

Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs,"Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs was a French philosopher.

Azaïs was born at Sorèze and died in Paris. He spent his early years as a teacher and a village organist. At the outbreak of the French Revolution he viewed it with favor but was soon disgusted at the violence of its methods. A critical pamphlet drew upon him the hatred of the revolutionists and it was not until 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. In 1809 he published his great work Des Compensations dans les destines humaines which pleased Napoleon so much that he made its author professor at St Cyr. In 1811 he became inspector of the public library at Avignon and from 1812 to 1815 he held the same position at Nancy. The Restoration government at first suspected him as a Bonapartist but at length granted him a pension. From that time he occupied himself in lecturing and the publication of philosophical works.

In the Compensations he sought to prove that on the whole happiness and misery are equally balanced and therefore that men should accept the government which is given them rather than risk the horrors of revolution. Le principe de linégalité naturelle et essentielle dans les destinées humaines conduit inevitablement au fanatisme revolutionnaire ou au fanatisme religieux.; The principles of compensation and equilibrium are found also in the physical universe the product of matter and force whose cause is God. Force naturally expansive and operating on the homogeneous atoms which constitute elemental matter is subject to the law of equilibrium or equivalence of action and reaction. The development of phenomena under this law may be divided into three stages the physical the physiological the intellectual and moral. The immaterial in man is the expansive force inherent in him. Moral and political phenomena are the result of the opposing forces of progress and preservation and their perfection lies in the fulfilment of the law of equilibrium or universal harmony. This may be achieved in seven thousand years when man will vanish from the world. In an additional five thousand a similar equilibrium will obtain in the physical sphere which will then itself pass away.

In addition to his philosophical work Azaïs studied music under his father Pierre Hyacinthe Azaïs professor of music at Sorèze and Toulouse and composer of sacred music in the style of Gossec. He wrote for the Revue musicale a series of articles entitled Acoustique fondamentale containing an ingenious but now exploded theory of the vibration of the air.

The sons other works are Système universel ; Du Sort de lhomme ; Cours de philosophie reproduced as Explication universelle ; Jeunesse maturité religion philosophie ; De la phrénologie du magnétisme et de la folie ."
Gaston Bachelard,"Gaston Bachelard was a French philosopher. He made contributions in the fields of poetics and the philosophy of science. To the latter he introduced the concepts of epistemological obstacle and epistemological break . He influenced many subsequent French philosophers among them Michel Foucault Louis Althusser Dominique Lecourt and Jacques Derrida as well as the sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Bruno Latour.

For Bachelard the scientific object should be constructed and therefore different from the positivist sciences; in other words information is in continuous construction. Empiricism and rationalism are not regarded as dualism or opposition but complementary therefore studies of a priori and a posteriori or in other words reason and dialectic are part of scientific research.

Bachelard was a postal clerk in Bar-sur-Aube and then studied physics and chemistry before finally becoming interested in philosophy. To obtain his doctorate in 1927 he wrote two theses the main one Essai sur la connaissance approchée under the direction of Abel Rey and the complementary one Étude sur lévolution dun problème de physique la propagation thermique dans les solides supervised by Léon Brunschvicg.

He first taught from 1902 to 1903 at the college of Sézanne but turned away from teaching to consider a career in telegraphy. Literary by training he took the technological path before moving towards science and mathematics. In particular he was fascinated by the great discoveries of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century .

He was a professor at the University of Dijon from 1930 to 1940 and then was appointed chair in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Paris. In 1958 he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.

Bachelards studies of the history and philosophy of science in such works as Le nouvel esprit scientifique and La formation de lesprit scientifique were based on his vision of historical epistemology as a kind of psychoanalysis of the scientific mind.

In the English-speaking world the connection Bachelard made between psychology and the history of science has been little understood. Bachelard demonstrated how the progress of science could be blocked by certain types of mental patterns creating the concept of obstacle épistémologique . One task of epistemology is to make clear the mental patterns at use in science in order to help scientists overcome the obstacles to knowledge. Another goal is to give back to human reason its function of agitation and aggressiveness as Bachelard put it in Lengagement rationaliste .

Bachelard was critical of Auguste Comtes positivism which considered science as a continual progress. To Bachelard scientific developments such as Einsteins theory of relativity demonstrated the discontinuous nature of the history of sciences. Thus models that framed scientific development as continuous such as that of Comte and Émile Meyerson seemed simplistic and erroneous to Bachelard.

Through his concept of epistemological break Bachelard underlined the discontinuity at work in the history of sciences. However the term epistemological break itself is almost never used by Bachelard but became famous through Louis Althusser.

He showed that new theories integrated old theories in new paradigms changing the sense of concepts . Thus non-Euclidean geometry did not contradict Euclidean geometry but integrated it into a larger framework.

Discharged in March 1919 and unemployed Bachelard searched and obtained a job in October as a professor of physics and chemistry at the college of Bar-sur-Aube. His wife Jeanne Rossi a schoolteacher he had married in 1914 was transferred to Voigny. His daughter Suzanne was born on October 18. He travelled the six kilometers to Bar-sur-Aube on foot every day was provided a very useful education and enrolled for a philosophy degree. Jeanne died in June 1920 and Bachelard raised his daughter alone.At the age of thirty-six he began a completely unexpected philosophical career. Starting decisively in 1922 he acquired the title of Doctor of Letters at the Sorbonne in 1927. His theses supported by Abel Rey and Léon Brunschvicg were published. He became a lecturer at the Faculty of Letters of Dijon from October 1927 but remained at the college of Bar-sur-Aube until 1930. He even participated in the municipal elections of 1929 to defend the project of a college for all.He nevertheless accepted a professorship at the University of Burgundy when his daughter Suzanne entered the second degree.

He did the same when he was appointed to the Sorbonne as a university professor and director of the Institute for the History of Science and Technology in 1940 accompanying his daughter in her higher educations.

On August 25 1937 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. He became a professor at the Sorbonne from 1940 to 1954. He held the chair of the history and philosophy of science where he succeeded Abel Rey director of the Institute of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology which in 1992 became IHPST.

Bachelard was a rationalist in the Cartesian sense although he recommended his non-Cartesian epistemology as a replacement for the more standard Cartesian epistemology. He compared scientific knowledge to ordinary knowledge in the way we deal with it and saw error as only illusion Scientifically one thinks truth as the historical rectification of a persistent error and experiments as correctives for an initial common illusion .

The role of epistemology is to show the history of the production of concepts. Those concepts are not just theoretical propositions they are simultaneously abstract and concrete pervading technical and pedagogical activity. This explains why The electric bulb is an object of scientific thought an example of an abstract-concrete object. To understand the way it works one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead it produces regional histories of science.

Bachelard never saw how seemingly irrational theories often simply represented a drastic shift in scientific perspective. For instance he never claimed that the theory of probabilities was just another way of complexifying reality through a deepening of rationality .

One of his main theses in The New Scientific Mind was that modern sciences had replaced the classical ontology of the substance with an ontology of relations which could be assimilated to something like a process philosophy. For instance the physical concepts of matter and rays correspond according to him to the metaphysical concepts of the thing and of movement; but whereas classical philosophy considered both as distinct and the thing as ontologically real modern science can not distinguish matter from rays. It is thus impossible to examine an immobile thing which was precisely the condition for knowledge according to the classical theory of knowledge .

In non-Cartesian epistemology there is no simple substance as in Cartesianism but only complex objects built by theories and experiments and continuously improved . Intuition is therefore not primitive but built . These themes led Bachelard to support a sort of constructivist epistemology.

In addition to epistemology Bachelards work deals with many other topics including poetry dreams psychoanalysis and the imagination. The Psychoanalysis of Fire and The Poetics of Space are among the most popular of his works Jean-Paul Sartre cites the former and Bachelards Water and Dreams in his Being and Nothingness and the latter had a wide reception in architectural theory circles and continues to be influential in literary theory and creative writing. In philosophy this nocturnal side of his work is developed by his student Gilbert Durand.

It should be noted in his singular career the concern which he had to ensure the development of his daughter so much the time was marked by the cleavage of the sexes and the functions. Going against sexist stereotypes he wanted to make his daughter a scholar. Suzanne would be a mathematician and philosopher and would be able to develop phenomenological and epistemological research of high standing.

Though most of Bachelards major works on poetics have been translated into English only about half of his works on the philosophy of science have been translated."
Suzanne Bachelard,Suzanne Bachelard was a French philosopher and academic. In 1958 she published La Conscience de la rationalité. She was the daughter of philosopher Gaston Bachelard whose posthumous book Fragments dune Poétique du Feu she edited. She taught at the Sorbonne where she also had Jacques Derrida as her assistant.She was the first translator to French of Edmund Husserl Formal and Transcendental Logic.
Élisabeth Badinter,"She is best known for her philosophical treatises on feminism and womens role in society. She is an advocate of liberal feminism and women migrant workers rights in France. Badinter is described as having a commitment to Enlightenment rationalism and universalism. She advocates for a moderate feminism. A 2010 Marianne news magazine poll named her Frances most influential intellectual primarily on the basis of her books on womens rights and motherhood.

Badinter is the largest shareholder of Publicis Groupe a multinational advertising and public relations company and the chairwoman of its supervisory board. She received these shares in an inheritance from her father Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet who founded the company. According to Forbes she is one of the wealthiest French citizens with a fortune of around US1.8billion in 2012.

Badinter was born in Boulogne-Billancourt to Sophie Vaillant and Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet founder of Publicis. Sophie Vaillant was the granddaughter of Édouard Vaillant a French political leader and social activist. Elizabeths mother was raised as a Roman Catholic in a middle class upbringing and later converted to Judaism following her marriage. She raised Élisabeth in the Jewish faith.

Elisabeth and her two sisters were raised by parents who believed in the equality of the sexes. She received her secondary education from Lécole alsacienne a private school in Paris. During adolescence Badinter read Simone de Beauvoirs the Second Sex which profoundly influenced her views inspiring her pursuit of a doctorate in philosophy at Sorbonne University. She is a specialist in French history of the Age of Enlightenment.

After her studies Badinter taught at the École Polytechnique. Her first book titled LAmour en plus was published in 1980 and raises the question of whether maternal love is an exclusively natural instinct or a tendency reinforced in the cultural context in which the behaviour of motherly affection is expected.

In her critical work Lun est lautre published in 1987 Badinter reflects upon the complementarities of masculine and feminine traits in gendered identities and the conflicts that arise when these complementarities are subjected to oppression. Badinter concludes that a new era of gendered resemblances will lead to a change in gender identities and a revolution of moral values.

Her 2003 treatise La fausse route addresses misandry and victimisation of women by French contemporary feminists. The systematic denial of womens power and violence the constant portrayal of women as oppressed and therefore innocent is deepening the crevasses of a divided humanity the victims of masculine oppression on one side and the almighty executioners on the other. She criticizes essentialists within the feminist movement arguing that Man is not the enemy.

During the 1989 Islamic scarf controversy in France Badinter Régis Debray Alain Finkielkraut Elisabeth de Fontenay and Catherine Kintzler wrote an open letter to the then Minister of Education Lionel Jospin demanding that students who refuse to take off their headscarves not be allowed to attend state schools. Badinter believes that the French public education system should be free of any religious affiliation and that neutrality in public institutions of a secularist state must prevail over expressions of individuality in them. In an interview with the Financial Times she says The religions of the Book have always fought against what would liberate women or facilitate their lives ... We talk about Muslim radicals all the time but its more general.

In 1966 she married lawyer Robert Badinter who became Minister of Justice under Mitterrand. Élisabeth and Robert Badinter have one daughter and two sons."
Alain Badiou,"Alain Badiou ; born 17 January 1937 is a French philosopher formerly chair of Philosophy at the École normale supérieure and founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the Université de Paris VIII with Gilles Deleuze Michel Foucault and Jean-François Lyotard. Badiou has written about the concepts of being truth event and the subject in a way that he claims is neither postmodern nor simply a repetition of modernity. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force.

Badiou is the son of the mathematician Raymond Badiou who was a working member of the Resistance in France during World War II. Alain Badiou was a student at the Lycée Louis-Le-Grand and then the École Normale Supérieure . In 1960 he wrote his diplôme détudes supérieures on Spinoza for Georges Canguilhem . He taught at the lycée in Reims from 1963 where he became a close friend of fellow playwright François Regnault and published a couple of novels before moving first to the faculty of letters of the University of Reims and then to the University of Paris VIII in 1969. Badiou was politically active very early on and was one of the founding members of the Unified Socialist Party . The PSU was particularly active in the struggle for the decolonization of Algeria. He wrote his first novel Almagestes in 1964. In 1967 he joined a study group organized by Louis Althusser became increasingly influenced by Jacques Lacan and became a member of the editorial board of Cahiers pour lAnalyse. By then he already had a solid grounding in mathematics and logic and his own two contributions to the pages of Cahiers anticipate many of the distinctive concerns of his later philosophy.

The student uprisings of May 1968 reinforced Badious commitment to the far Left and he participated in increasingly militant groups such as the Union des communistes de France marxiste-léniniste . To quote Badiou himself the UCFml is the Maoist organization established in late 1969 by Natacha Michel Sylvain Lazarus myself and a fair number of young people. During this time Badiou joined the faculty of the newly founded University of Paris VIIIVincennes-Saint Denis which was a bastion of counter-cultural thought. There he engaged in fierce intellectual debates with fellow professors Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard whose philosophical works he considered unhealthy deviations from the Althusserian program of a scientific Marxism.

In the 1980s as both Althusserian structural Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis went into decline Badiou published more technical and abstract philosophical works such as Théorie du sujet and his magnum opus Being and Event . Nonetheless Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more recent works .

He took up his current position at the ENS in 1999. He is also associated with a number of other institutions such as the Collège International de Philosophie. He was a member of LOrganisation Politique which as mentioned above he founded in 1985 with some comrades from the Maoist UCFml. This organization disbanded in 2007 according to the French Wikipedia article . In 2002 he was a co-founder of the Centre International dEtude de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine alongside Yves Duroux and his former student Quentin Meillassoux. Badiou has also enjoyed success as a dramatist with plays such as Ahmed le Subtil.

In the last decade an increasing number of Badious works have been translated into English such as Ethics Deleuze Manifesto for Philosophy Metapolitics and Being and Event. Short pieces by Badiou have likewise appeared in American and English periodicals such as Lacanian Ink New Left Review Radical Philosophy Cosmos and History and Parrhesia. Unusually for a contemporary European philosopher his work is increasingly being taken up by militants in countries like India the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.

In 201415 Badiou had the role of Honorary President at The Global Center for Advanced Studies.

In 2005 a fierce controversy in Parisian intellectual life erupted after the publication of Badious Circonstances 3 Portées du mot juif . This book generated a strong response and the wrangling became a cause célèbre with articles going back and forth in the French newspaper Le Monde and in the cultural journal Les Temps modernes. Linguist and Lacanian philosopher Jean-Claude Milner a past president of Collège international de philosophie accused Badiou of anti-Semitism.

Badiou forcefully rebutted this charge declaring that his accusers often conflate a nation-state with religious preference and will label as anti-Semitic anyone who objects to this tendency It is wholly intolerable to be accused of anti-Semitism by anyone for the sole reason that from the fact of the extermination one does not conclude as to the predicate Jew and its religious and communitarian dimension that it receive some singular valorization a transcendent annunciation nor that Israeli exactions whose colonial nature is patent and banal be specially tolerated. I propose that nobody any longer accept publicly or privately this type of political blackmail.

Badiou characterizes the state of Israel as neither more nor less impure than all states but objects to its exclusive identitarian claim to be a Jewish state and the way it draws incessant privileges from this claim especially when it comes to trampling underfoot what serves us as international law. For example he continues The Islamic states are certainly no more progressive as models than the various versions of the Arab nation were. Everyone agrees it seems on the point that the Taliban do not embody the path of modernity for Afghanistan. A modern democracy he writes must count all its residents as citizens and there is no acceptable reason to exempt the state of Israel from that rule. The claim is sometimes made that this state is the only democratic state in the region. But the fact that this state presents itself as a Jewish state is directly contradictory.

Badiou is optimistic that ongoing political problems can be resolved by de-emphasizing the communitarian religious dimension The signifier Palestinian or Arab should not be glorified any more than is permitted for the signifier Jew. As a result the legitimate solution to the Middle East conflict is not the dreadful institution of two barbed-wire states. The solution is the creation of a secular and democratic Palestine...which would show that it is perfectly possible to create a place in these lands where from a political point of view and regardless of the apolitical continuity of customs there is neither Arab nor Jew. This will undoubtedly demand a regional Mandela.

Badiou makes repeated use of several concepts throughout his philosophy in line with his training at Ecole Normale Superieure in the history of philosophy which entails in France a close reading of the great classics of philosophy in their original languages such as Greek and Latin which he handles fluently. His method cannot be fully understood if it is not replaced in the ways and means of French academic philosophy which always engages a detailed decrypting of texts in their original version as evinced by philosophers as diverse as Foucault Deleuze Balibar Bourdieu Derrida Bouveresse and Engel - all of them alumni of the Ecole Normale Superieure. 

One of the aims of his thought is to show that his categories of truth are useful for any type of philosophical critique. Therefore he uses them to interrogate art and history as well as ontology and scientific discovery. Johannes Thumfart argues that Badious philosophy can be regarded as a contemporary reinterpretation of Platonism.

According to Badiou philosophy is suspended from four conditions each of them fully independent truth procedures. Badiou consistently maintains throughout his work that philosophy must avoid the temptation to suture itself to any of these independent truth procedures. When philosophy does suture itself to one of its conditions what results is a philosophical disaster. Consequently philosophy is according to Badiou a thinking of the compossibility of the several truth procedures whether this is undertaken through the investigation of the intersections between distinct truth procedures or whether this is undertaken through the more traditionally philosophical work of addressing categories like truth or the subject . For Badiou when philosophy addresses the four truth procedures in a genuinely philosophical manner rather than through a suturing abandonment of philosophy as such it speaks of them with a theoretical terminology that marks its philosophical character inaesthetics rather than art; metapolitics rather than politics; ontology rather than science; etc.

Truth for Badiou is a specifically philosophical category. While philosophys several conditions are on their own terms truth procedures it is only philosophy that can speak of the several truth procedures as truth procedures. Badiou has a very rigorous notion of truth one that is strongly against the grain of much of contemporary European thought. Badiou at once embraces the traditional modernist notion that truths are genuinely invariant and the incisively postmodernist notion that truths are constructed through processes. Badious theory of truth exposited throughout his work accomplishes this strange mixture by uncoupling invariance from self-evidence as well as by uncoupling constructedness from relativity .

The idea here is that a truths invariance makes it genuinely indiscernible because a truth is everywhere and always the case it passes unnoticed unless there is a rupture in the laws of being and appearance during which the truth in question becomes but only for a passing moment discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out in important ways in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question genuine knowledge is produced . While such knowledge is produced in the process of being faithful to a truth event for Badiou knowledge in the figure of the encyclopedia always remains fragile subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou truth procedures proceed to infinity such that faith outstrips knowledge. The dominating ideology of the day which Badiou terms democratic materialism denies the existence of truth and only recognizes bodies and languages. Badiou proposes a turn towards the materialist dialectic which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages except there are also truths.

In Handbook of Inaesthetics Badiou both draws on the original Greek meaning and the later Kantian concept of aesthesis as material perception and coins the phrase inaesthetic to refer to a concept of artistic creation that denies the reflectionobject relation yet at the same time in reaction against the idea of mimesis or poetic reflection of nature he affirms that art is immanent and singular. Art is immanent in the sense that its truth is given in its immediacy in a given work of art and singular in that its truth is found in art and art alonehence reviving the ancient materialist concept of aesthesis. His view of the link between philosophy and art is tied into the motif of pedagogy which he claims functions so as to arrange the forms of knowledge in a way that some truth may come to pierce a hole in them. He develops these ideas with examples from the prose of Samuel Beckett and the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé and Fernando Pessoa among others.

The major propositions of Badious philosophy all find their basis in Being and Event in which he continues his attempt to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies. A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits through its fixation on semiotics and language any notion of a subject. Badious work is by his own admission an attempt to break out of contemporary philosophys fixation upon language which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him in Being and Event to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both analytical and continental traditions. In Badious own opinion this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up.Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake in fact it was translated into English only in 2005 a full seventeen years after its French publication.

As is implied in the title of the book two elements mark the thesis of Being and Event the place of ontology or the science of being qua being and the place of the event which is seen as a rupture in being through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory and specifically ZermeloFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. In short the event is a truth caused by a hidden part or set appearing within existence; this part escapes language and known existence and thus being itself lacks the terms and resources to fully process the event. 

For Badiou the problem which the Greek tradition of philosophy has faced and never satisfactorily dealt with is that while beings themselves are plural and thought in terms of multiplicity being itself is thought to be singular; that is it is thought in terms of the one. He proposes as the solution to this impasse the following declaration that the One is not . This is why Badiou accords set theory such stature and refers to mathematics as the very place of ontology Only set theory allows one to conceive a pure doctrine of the multiple. Set theory does not operate in terms of definite individual elements in groupings but only functions insofar as what belongs to a set is of the same relation as that set . What individuates a set therefore is not an existential positive proposition but other multiples whose properties validate its presentation. The structure of being thus secures the regime of the count-as-one. So if one is to think of a set for instance the set of people or humanity as counting as one the multiple elements which belong to that set are secured as one consistent concept but only in terms of what does not belong to that set. What is crucial for Badiou is that the structural form of the count-as-one which makes multiplicities thinkable implies that the proper name of being does not belong to an element as such but rather the void set the set to which nothing belongs. It may help to understand the concept count-as-one if it is associated with the concept of terming a multiple is not one but it is referred to with multiple one word. To count a set as one is to mention that set. How the being of terms such as multiple does not contradict the non-being of the one can be understood by considering the multiple nature of terminology for there to be a term without there also being a system of terminology within which the difference between terms gives context and meaning to any one term is impossible. Terminology implies precisely difference between terms as the condition for meaning. The idea of a term without meaning is incoherent the count-as-one is a structural effect or a situational operation; it is not an event of truth. Multiples which are composed or consistent are count-effects. Inconsistent multiplicity the presentation of presentation.

Badious use of set theory in this manner is not just illustrative or heuristic. Badiou uses the axioms of ZermeloFraenkel set theory to identify the relationship of being to history Nature the State and God. Most significantly this use means that there is a strict prohibition on self-belonging; a set cannot contain or belong to itself. This results from the axiom of foundation or the axiom of regularity which enacts such a prohibition . Badious philosophy draws two major implications from this prohibition. Firstly it secures the inexistence of the one there cannot be a grand overarching set and thus it is fallacious to conceive of a grand cosmos a whole Nature or a Being of God. Badiou is therefore against Georg Cantor from whom he draws heavily staunchly atheist. However secondly this prohibition prompts him to introduce the event. Because according to Badiou the axiom of foundation founds all sets in the void it ties all being to the historico-social situation of the multiplicities of de-centred sets thereby effacing the positivity of subjective action or an entirely new occurrence. And whilst this is acceptable ontologically it is unacceptable Badiou holds philosophically. Set theory mathematics has consequently pragmatically abandoned an area which philosophy cannot. And so Badiou argues there is therefore only one possibility remaining that ontology can say nothing about the event.

Several critics have questioned Badious use of mathematics. Mathematician Alan Sokal and physicist Jean Bricmont write that Badiou proposes with seemingly utter seriousness a blending of psychoanalysis politics and set theory that they contend is preposterous. Similarly philosopher Roger Scruton has questioned Badious grasp of the foundation of mathematics writing in 2012

An example of a critique from a mathematicians point of view is the essay Badious Number A Critique of Mathematics as Ontology by Ricardo L. Nirenberg and David Nirenberg which takes issue in particular with Badious matheme of the Event in Being and Event which has already been alluded to in respect of the axiom of foundation above. Nirenberg and Nirenberg write

Badiou again turns here to mathematics and set theory Badious language of ontology to study the possibility of an indiscernible element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician Paul J. Cohen using what are called the conditions of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination a domination being that which defines a set. Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible set is dominated by the conditions which dont possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. These sets are in line with constructible ontology relative to ones being-in-the-world and ones being in language . However he continues the dominations themselves are whilst being relative concepts not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination in the terms of mathematical ontology as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a set of dominations which he refers to as the indiscernible set or the generic set. It is therefore he continues possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language by a process Cohen calls forcing. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the indiscernible it falls to the subject about which the ontological situation cannot comment to nominate this indiscernible this generic point; and thus nominate and give name to the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought.

Badious ultimate ethical maxim is therefore one of decide upon the undecidable. It is to name the indiscernible the generic set and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject can potentially witness an event love science politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a generic procedure which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity truth has the potentiality to emerge.

In line with his concept of the event Badiou maintains politics is not about politicians but activism based on the present situation and the evental rupture. So too does love have this characteristic of becoming anew. Even in science the guesswork that marks the event is prominent. He vigorously rejects the tag of decisionist but rather argues that the recasting of a truth comes prior to its veracity or verifiability. As he says of Galileo 

While Badiou is keen to reject an equivalence between politics and philosophy he correlates nonetheless his political activism and skepticism toward the parliamentary-democratic process with his philosophy based around singular situated truths and potential revolutions.

Alain Badiou is a founding member of the militant French political organisation LOrganisation Politique which was active from 1985 until it disbanded in 2007. It called itself a post-party organization concerned with direct popular intervention in a wide range of issues . In addition to numerous writings and interventions LOrganisation Politique highlighted the importance of developing political prescriptions concerning undocumented migrants stressing that they must be conceived primarily as workers and not immigrants.

Alain Badiou gained great notoriety in 2007 with his pamphlet The Meaning of Sarkozy which quickly sold 60000 copies whereas for 40 years the sales of his books had oscillated between 2000 and 6000 copies."
Bonaventure,"Bonaventure born Giovanni di Fidanza was an Italian medieval Franciscan scholastic theologian and philosopher. The seventh Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor he was also Cardinal Bishop of Albano. He was canonised on 14 April 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV and declared a Doctor of the Church in the year 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. He is known as the Seraphic Doctor . His feast day is July 15. Many writings believed in the Middle Ages to be his are now collected under the name Pseudo-Bonaventure.

He was born at Bagnoregio not far from Viterbo then part of the Papal States. Almost nothing is known of his childhood other than the names of his parents Giovanni di Fidanza and Maria di Ritella. Bonaventure reports that in his youth he was saved from an untimely death by the prayers of Francis of Assisi which is the primary motivation for Bonaventures writing the vita.

He entered the Franciscan Order in 1243 and studied at the University of Paris possibly under Alexander of Hales and certainly under Alexanders successor John of Rochelle. In 1253 he held the Franciscan chair at Paris. A dispute between seculars and mendicants delayed his reception as Master until 1257 where his degree was taken in company with Thomas Aquinas. Three years earlier his fame had earned him the position of lecturer on The Four Books of Sentencesa book of theology written by Peter Lombard in the twelfth centuryand in 1255 he received the degree of master the medieval equivalent of doctor.

After having successfully defended his order against the reproaches of the anti-mendicant party he was elected Minister General of the Franciscan Order. On 24 November 1265 he was selected for the post of Archbishop of York; however he was never consecrated and resigned the appointment in October 1266.

During his tenure the General Chapter of Narbonne held in 1260 promulgated a decree prohibiting the publication of any work out of the order without permission from superiors. This prohibition has induced modern writers to pass severe judgment upon Roger Bacons superiors who were assumed to be envious of Bacons abilities. However the prohibition enjoined on Bacon was a general one which extended to the whole order. Its promulgation was not directed against him but rather against Gerard of Borgo San Donnino. In 1254 Gerard had published without permission a heretical work Introductorius in Evangelium æternum . Thereupon the General Chapter of Narbonne promulgated their decree identical with the constitutio gravis in contrarium Bacon speaks of. The prohibition was rescinded in Rogers favor unexpectedly in 1266.

Bonaventure was instrumental in procuring the election of Pope Gregory X who rewarded him with the title of Cardinal Bishop of Albano and insisted on his presence at the great Second Council of Lyon in 1274. There after his significant contributions led to a union of the Greek and Latin churches Bonaventure died suddenly and under suspicious circumstances. The 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia has citations that suggest he was poisoned but no mention is made of this in the 2003 second edition of the New Catholic Encyclopedia. 

He steered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that made them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the coming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt completely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the one true master who offers humans knowledge that begins in faith is developed through rational understanding and is perfected by mystical union with God.

In the year 1434 160 years after his death his body was moved to a new church that was considered more fitting. Upon doing so the head was found to be entirely incorrupt. The hair lips teeth and tongue were perfectly preserved and retained their natural colour. The people of Lyons were profoundly affected by this miracle and they chose Bonaventure for the patron of their city. The movement already on foot to obtain his canonization received thereby a new and powerful impetus. However a century later in 1562 the city of Lyons was captured by Huguenots who burned Bonaventures body in the public square. In the nineteenth century during Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution the urn containing the incorrupt head was hidden after which the church was razed to the ground. The urn has never been recovered. The only extant relic of Bonaventure is the arm and hand with which he wrote his Commentary on the Sentences which is now conserved at Bagnoregio in the parish church of St. Nicholas.

Bonaventure was formally canonised in 1484 by the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV and ranked along with Thomas Aquinas as the greatest of the Doctors of the Church by another Franciscan Pope Sixtus V in 1587. Bonaventure was regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the Middle Ages. His works as arranged in the most recent Critical Edition by the Quaracchi Fathers consist of a Commentary on the Sentences of Lombard in four volumes and eight other volumes including a Commentary on the Gospel of St Luke and a number of smaller works; the most famous of which are The Minds Road to God an outline of his theology or Brief Reading Reduction of the Arts to Theology and Soliloquy on the Four Spiritual Exercises The Tree of Life and The Triple Way the latter three written for the spiritual direction of his fellow Franciscans.

The German philosopher Dieter Hattrup denies that Reduction of the Arts to Theology was written by Bonaventure claiming that the style of thinking does not match Bonaventures original style. His position is no longer tenable given recent research the text remains indubitably authentic. A work that for many years was falsely attributed to Bonaventure De septem itineribus aeternitatis was actually written by Rudolf von Biberach .

For Isabelle of France the sister of King Louis IX of France and her monastery of Poor Clares at Longchamps Bonaventure wrote the treatise Concerning the Perfection of Life.

The Commentary on the Sentences written at the command of his superiors when he was twenty-seven is Bonaventures major work and most of his other theological and philosophical writings are in some way dependent on it. However some of Bonaventures later works such as the Lectures on the Six Days of Creation show substantial developments beyond the Sentences.

Bonaventure wrote on almost every subject treated by the Scholastics and his writings are substantial. A great number of them deal with faith in Christ God and theology. No work of Bonaventures is exclusively philosophical a striking illustration of the mutual interpenetration of philosophy and theology that is a distinguishing mark of the Scholastic period.

Much of Bonaventures philosophical thought shows a considerable influence by Augustine of Hippo so much so that De Wulf considers him the best medieval representative of Augustinianism. Bonaventure adds Aristotelian principles to the Augustinian doctrine especially in connection with the illumination of the intellect and the composition of human beings and other living creatures in terms of matter and form. Augustine who had introduced into the west many of the doctrines that would define scholastic philosophy was a critically important source of Bonaventures Platonism. The mystic Dionysius the Areopagite was another notable influence.

In philosophy Bonaventure presents a marked contrast to his contemporaries Roger Bacon Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas. While these may be taken as representing respectively physical science yet in its infancy and Aristotelian scholasticism in its most perfect form Bonaventure presents the mystical and Platonizing mode of speculation that had already to some extent found expression in Hugo and Richard of St. Victor Alexander of Hales and in Bernard of Clairvaux. To him the purely intellectual element though never absent is of inferior interest when compared with the living power of the affections or the heart.

Like Thomas Aquinas with whom he shared numerous profound agreements in matters theological and philosophical he combated the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world vigorously . Bonaventure accepts the neo-Platonic doctrine that forms do not exist as subsistent entities but as ideals or archetypes in the mind of God according to which actual things were formed; and this conception has no slight influence upon his philosophy. Due to this physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein contended that Bonaventure showed strong pandeistic inclinations.

Like all the great scholastic doctors Bonaventura starts with the discussion of the relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but the handmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths that form the groundwork of the Christian system but other truths can only be received and apprehended through divine illumination. To obtain this illumination the soul must employ the proper means which are prayer; the exercise of the virtues whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light; and meditation that may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The supreme end of life is a union in contemplation or intellect or intense absorbing love; but it cannot be entirely reached in this life and remains as a hope for the future.

Like Aquinas and other notable thirteenth-century philosophers and theologians Bonaventure believed that it is possible to logically prove the existence of God and the immortality of the soul. He offers several arguments for the existence of God including versions of Anselm of Canterburys ontological argument and Augustines argument from eternal truths. His main argument for the immortality of the soul appeals to humans natural desire for perfect happiness and is reflected in C. S. Lewiss argument from desire. Contrary to Aquinas Bonaventure did not believe that philosophy was an autonomous discipline that could be pursued successfully independently of theology. Any philosopher is bound to fall into serious error he believed who lacks the light of faith.

A master of the memorable phrase Bonaventure held that philosophy opens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on their journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived as shadows and vestiges of God understood as the ultimate cause of a world that philosophical reason can prove was created at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived of as images and likenesses of God the workings of the human mind and will leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and donor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of being in which Bonaventure brought Anselms argument together with Aristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely perfect being whose essence entails its existence an absolutely simple being that causes all other composite beings to exist.

Bonaventure however is not only a meditative thinker whose works may form good manuals of devotion; he is a dogmatic theologian of high rank and on all the disputed questions of scholastic thought such as universals matter seminal reasons the principle of individuation or the intellectus agens he gives weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with Albert the Great in regarding theology as a practical science; its truths according to his view are peculiarly adapted to influence the affections. He discusses very carefully the nature and meaning of the divine attributes; considers universals to be the ideal forms pre-existing in the divine mind according to which things were shaped; holds matter to be pure potentiality that receives individual being and determinateness from the formative power of God acting according to the ideas; and finally maintains that the agent intellect has no separate existence. On these and on many other points of scholastic philosophy the Seraphic Doctor exhibits a combination of subtlety and moderation which makes his works particularly valuable.

In form and intent the work of St. Bonaventure is always the work of a theologian; he writes as one for whom the only angle of vision and the proximate criterion of truth is the Christian faith. This fact affects his importance as a philosopher; when coupled with his style it makes Bonaventure perhaps the least accessible of the major figures of the thirteenth century. This is true because philosophy interests him largely as a praeparatio evangelica as something to be interpreted as a foreshadow of or deviation from what God has revealed.

Bonaventures feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar immediately upon his canonisation in 1482. It was at first celebrated on the second Sunday in July but was moved in 1568 to 14 July since 15 July the anniversary of his death was at that time taken up with the feast of Saint Henry. It remained on that date with the rank of double until 1960 when it was reclassified as a feast of the third class. In 1969 it was classified as an obligatory memorial and assigned to the date of his death 15 July.

Bonaventure is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 15 July.

Étienne Balibar,"Balibar was born in Avallon Yonne Burgundy France in 1942 and first rose to prominence as one of Althussers pupils at the École normale supérieure. He entered the École normale supérieure in 1960.

In 1961 Balibar joined the Parti communiste français. He was expelled in 1981 for critiquing the partys policy on immigration in an article.

Balibar participated in Louis Althussers seminar on Karl Marxs Das Kapital in 1965. This seminar resulted in the book Reading Capital co-authored by Althusser and his students. Balibars chapter On the Basic Concepts of Historical Materialism was republished along with those of Althusser in the books abridged version until a complete translation was published in 2016.

In 1987 he received his doctorate degree in philosophy from the Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands. He received his habilitation from the Université Paris I in 1993. Balibar joined the University of Paris X-Nanterre as a professor in 1994 and the University of California Irvine in 2000. He became Professor Emeritus of Paris X in 2002.

His daughter with the physicist Françoise Balibar is the actress Jeanne Balibar.

In Masses Classes and Ideas Balibar argues that in Das Kapital the theory of historical materialism comes into conflict with the critical theory that Marx begins to develop particularly in his analysis of the category of labor which in capitalism becomes a form of property. This conflict involves two distinct uses of the term labor labor as the revolutionary class subject and labor as an objective condition for the reproduction of capitalism . In The German Ideology Marx conflates these two meanings and treats labor as in Balibars words the veritable site of truth as well as the place from which the world is changed...

In Capital however the disparity between the two senses of labor becomes apparent. One manifestation of this is the virtual disappearance in the text of the term proletariat. As Balibar points out the term appears only twice in the first edition of Capital published in 1867 in the dedication to Wilhelm Wolff and in the two final sections on the General Law of Capitalist Accumulation. For Balibar this implies that the emergence of a revolutionary form of subjectivity ... is never a specific property of nature and therefore brings with it no guarantees but obliges us to search for the conditions in a conjuncture that can precipitate class struggles into mass movements.... Moreover here is no proof that these forms are always and eternally the same .

In The Nation Form History and Ideology Balibar critiques modern conceptions of the nation-state. He states that he is undertaking a study of the contradiction of the nation-state because Thinking about racism led us back to nationalism and nationalism to uncertainty about the historical realities and categorization of the nation .

Balibar contends that it is impossible to pinpoint the beginning of a nation or to argue that the modern people who inhabit a nation-state are the descendants of the nation that preceded it. Balibar argues that because no nation-state has an ethnic base every nation-state must create fictional ethnicities in order to project stability on the populace 

In order to minimize these regional class and race conflicts nation-states fabricate myths of origin that produce the illusion of shared ethnicity among all their inhabitants. In order to create these myths of origins nation-states scour the historical period during which they were formed to find justification for their existence. They also create the illusion of shared ethnicity through linguistic communities when everyone has access to the same language they feel as if they share an ethnicity. Balibar argues that schooling is the principal institution which produces ethnicity as linguistic community . In addition this ethnicity is created through the nationalization of the family meaning that the state comes to perform certain functions that might traditionally be performed by the family such as the regulation of marriages and administration of social security. In recent work following the populist wave Balibar has called the incorporation of these different elements absolute capitalism."
Renaud Barbaras,"Renaud Barbaras is a French contemporary philosopher. An École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud alumnus he is Chair of Contemporary Philosophy in the University of Paris 1 Sorbonne.

A phenomenologist Barbaras works have primarily focused on the philosophies of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. More recently his readings of Czech philosopher Jan Patočka have influenced him into conceiving a phenomenology of life and accordingly a cosmology in which mans place is to be thought anew.

In 1999 Renaud Barbaras built his philosophy in confrontation with the aporias of the philosophy of the late Merleau-Ponty the philosopher he worked on for his PhD. His doctoral thesis subtitled an introduction to a phenomenology of perception is in homage to Merleau-Ponty. Barbaras Desire and distance addresses the consequences of the Abschattungslehre that neither Husserl nor Merleau-Ponty managed to clarify his idea is to be faithful to the principle according to which the fact that we only perceive one side of the things around us doesnt mean we dont perceive them as themselves. This is what he calls not submitting perception to the law of object the mistake he spots is the prejudice we have in our way of perceiving as imperfect in comparison with the supposed plenitude of the things themselves. But to be consequential would be to acknowledge the fact that nothing can appear if not to a subject. This doesnt mean that the subject is constituting the object but merely that he is a part of the process of manifestation. To be a part of and not to be constituting this requires a new definition of subjectivity which Barbaras tries to give through the conception of a subject based on the natural movement and what he calls desire"
Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire,"Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire was a French philosopher journalist statesman and possible illegitimate son of Napoleon I of France.

Jules was born in Paris. Marie Belloc Lowndes in the second volume of her autobiography Where Love and Friendship Dwelt made claims regarding his paternity. He was reportedly ashamed of and did not talk about it. Lowndes did not say who his mother was.

In his early years he worked for the Ministry of Finance and was an active journalist. From 1826 to 1830 he opposed the policies of Charles X of France in Le Globe. At the revolution of 1830 he signed the protestation of the journalists on 28 July 1830.

After 1830 he contributed to different newspapers Le Constitutionnel Le National and Le Courrier français until 1833 when he gave up politics in order to devote himself to the history of ancient philosophy undertaking a translation of Aristotle which occupied him the greater part of his life. The reputation he gained from this work won him the chair of ancient philosophy at the Collège de France and a seat at the Academy of Moral and Political Science .

After the revolution of 1848 he was elected as a republican deputy from the département of Seine-et-Oise. He was named by the Minister of Public Instruction Carnot head of the commission preparing the draft for the education reforms. However after Carnots resignation and replacement by Alfred de Falloux the commission was dissolved. Nevertheless Barthélémy-Saint-Hilaire deposed to the National Assembly the report and the propositions written by the commission which were ignored. After the May 1849 legislative election won by the conservative Parti de lOrdre he was however re-elected and named again as a member of the parliamentary commission on education. During three years he thus played an important role during the debates leading to the adoption of the Falloux Laws in 18501851 which greatly increased the clergys influence on education to the dismay of Republicans such as Saint-Hilaire.

He was obliged to withdraw after the December 1851 coup détat of Louis Napoleon. In 1855 he went as member of the international commission to Egypt to report on the possibility of the proposed Suez canal and by the articles which he wrote he contributed largely to making the project popular in France.

Elected deputy again in 1869 he joined the opposition to the Second Empire and in 1871 as a member of the Centre gauche parliamentary group bent all his efforts to the election of Thiers as President of the Republic acting afterwards as his secretary. Appointed senator for life in 1875 he took his place among the moderate republicans and from 23 September 1880 to 14 November 1881 was minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of Jules Ferry. The most important event of his administration was the annexation of Tunis under the form of a French protectorate which he actively promoted.

In 1882 the village of St. Hilaire Minnesota in the United States was named in his honor.

He died in Paris in 1895. His principal works besides the translation of Aristotle and a number of studies connected with the same subject are Des Védas Du Bouddhisme and Mahomet et le Coran ."
Roland Barthes,"Roland Gérard Barthes was a French literary theorist essayist philosopher critic and semiotician. His work engaged in the analysis of a variety of sign systems mainly derived from Western popular culture. His ideas explored a diverse range of fields and influenced the development of many schools of theory including structuralism anthropology literary theory and post-structuralism.

Barthes is perhaps best known for his 1957 essay collection Mythologies which contained reflections on popular culture and 1967 essay The Death of the Author which critiqued traditional approaches in literary criticism. During his academic career he was primarily associated with the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales and the Collège de France.

Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of Cherbourg in Normandy. His father naval officer Louis Barthes was killed in a battle during World War I in the North Sea before Barthess first birthday. His mother Henriette Barthes and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of Bayonne. When Barthes was eleven his family moved to Paris though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne where he earned a licence in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period suffering from tuberculosis which often had to be treated in the isolation of sanatoria. His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during World War II.

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a licence in grammar and philology publishing his first papers taking part in a medical study and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a diplôme détudes supérieures from the University of Paris in 1941 for his work in Greek tragedy.

In 1948 he returned to purely academic work gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in France Romania and Egypt. During this time he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper Combat out of which grew his first full-length work Writing Degree Zero .

In 1952 Barthes settled at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique where he studied lexicology and sociology. During his seven-year period there he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine Les Lettres Nouvelles in which he dismantled myths of popular culture . Consisting of fifty-four short essays mostly written between 1954 and 1956 Mythologies were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling. Knowing little English Barthes taught at Middlebury College in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work Richard Howard that summer in New York City.

Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of semiology and structuralism chairing various faculty positions around France and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of literary criticism and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature Raymond Picard who attacked the French New Criticism for its obscurity and lack of respect towards Frances literary roots. Barthess rebuttal in Criticism and Truth accused the old bourgeois criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories such as Marxism.

By the late 1960s Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the US and Japan delivering a presentation at Johns Hopkins University. During this time he wrote his best-known work the 1967 essay The Death of the Author which in light of the growing influence of Jacques Derridas deconstruction would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of structuralist thought.

Barthes continued to contribute with Philippe Sollers to the avant-garde literary magazine Tel Quel which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthess writings. In 1970 Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work the dense critical reading of Balzacs Sarrasine entitled SZ. Throughout the 1970s Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of textuality and novelistic neutrality. In 1971 he served as visiting professor at the University of Geneva. In those same years he became primarily associated with the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales .

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled Roland Barthes and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the Collège de France. In the same year his mother Henriette Barthes to whom he had been devoted died aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work Camera Lucida is partly an essay about the nature of photography and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs though none of them are of Henriette.

On 25 February 1980 Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later on 26 March he died from the chest injuries he sustained in the accident.

Barthess earliest ideas reacted to the trend of existentialist philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s specifically to the figurehead of existentialism Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartres What Is Literature expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental avant-garde forms which he feels alienate readers. Barthess response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In Writing Degree Zero Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style rendering neither purely creative. Instead form or what Barthes calls writing is the unique and creative act. However a writers form is vulnerable to becoming a convention once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In Michelet a critical analysis of the French historian Jules Michelet Barthes developed these notions applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelets views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings he continued one should not seek to learn from Michelets claims; rather one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly Barthes felt that avant-garde writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths Barthes argued avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world rather than seek to explain it as Michelet had done.

Barthess many monthly contributions collected in his Mythologies frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how bourgeois society asserted its values through them. For example Barthes cited the portrayal of wine in French society. Its description as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities . He found semiotics the study of signs useful in these interrogations. He developed a theory of signs to demonstrate this perceived deception. He suggested that the construction of myths results in two levels of signification the language-object a first order linguistic system; and the metalanguage the second-order system transmitting the myth. The former pertains to the literal or explicit meaning of things while the latter is composed of the language used to speak about the first order. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs or connotations. A picture of a full dark bottle is a signifier that relates to a specific signified a fermented alcoholic beverage. However the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified the idea of healthy robust relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term myth while analyzing the popular consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values.

In The Fashion System Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus if popular fashion says that a blouse is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with skirt vest or any number of combinations. In the end Barthess Mythologies became absorbed into bourgeois culture as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses thinking it might be a fruitless attempt and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

As Barthess work with structuralism began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthess Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative thus allowing narrative to be viewed along linguistic lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels functions actions and narrative. Functions are the elementary pieces of a work such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an action and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key functions work in forming characters. For example key words like dark mysterious and odd when integrated together formulate a specific kind of character or action. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of bourgeois culture.

While Barthes found structuralism to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The post-structuralist movement and the deconstructionism of Jacques Derrida were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthess work exemplified. Derrida identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing is hollow.

Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols but also of Western cultures dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to Japan in 1966 where he wrote Empire of Signs a meditation on Japanese cultures contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards describing the centre of Tokyo the Emperors Palace as not a great overbearing entity but a silent and nondescript presence avoided and unconsidered. As such Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit retaining only the significance naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in Mythologies which was revealed to be always asserting a greater more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work the essay The Death of the Author . Barthes saw the notion of the author or authorial authority in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the authors mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such the whole notion of the knowable text acts as little more than another delusion of Western bourgeois culture. Indeed the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. The Death of the Author is considered to be a post-structuralist work since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the bourgeois norms. Indeed the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning cant come from the author it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his SZ Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of Sarrasine a Balzac novella. The result was a reading that established five major codes for determining various kinds of significance with numerous lexias throughout the text a lexia here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily for further analysis. The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements . From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that Sarrasine suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text in which the reader is active in a creative process and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature an openness for interpretation.

In the late 1970s Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language that of popular culture which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions and neutral which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the Doxa and the Para-doxa. While Barthes had sympathized with Marxist thought in the past he felt that despite its anti-ideological stance Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings as was bourgeois literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this he wrote The Pleasure of the Text a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking hedonism. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act through which the reader exposes himherself to the ideas of the writer the final cathartic climax of this pleasurable reading which he termed the bliss in reading or jouissance is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works like Mythologies had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was A Lovers Discourse Fragments in 1977 in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lovers search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lovers attempts to assert himself into a false ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The result is one that challenges the readers views of social constructs of love without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

Barthes also attempted to reinterpret the mind-body dualism theory. Like Friedrich Nietzsche and Levinas he also drew from Eastern philosophical traditions in his critique of European culture as infected by Western metaphysics. His body theory emphasized the formation of the self through bodily cultivation. The theory which is also described as ethico-political entity considers the idea of the body as one that functions as a fashion word that provides the illusion of a grounded discourse. This theory has influenced the work of other thinkers such as Jerome Bel.

Throughout his career Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer naturalistic truths. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother Henriette Barthes died in 1977 he began writing Camera Lucida as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual that which pierces the viewer Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mothers picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of what is where what was would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthess death her childhood photograph is evidence of what has ceased to be. Instead of making reality solid it reminds us of the worlds ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthess mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death Camera Lucida was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by François Wahl Incidents. It contains fragments from his journals his Soirées de Paris ; an earlier diary he kept which explicitly detailed his paying for sex with men and boys in Morocco; and Light of the Sud Ouest . In November 2007 Yale University Press published a new translation into English of Barthess little known work What is Sport. This work bears a considerable resemblance to Mythologies and was originally commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as the text for a documentary film directed by Hubert Aquin.

In February 2009 Éditions du Seuil published Journal de deuil based on Barthess files written from 26 November 1977 up to 15 September 1979 intimate notes on his terrible loss

The idea that she had not been everything to me. Otherwise I would never have written a work. Since my taking care of her for six months long she actually had become everything for me and I totally forgot of ever have written anything at all. I was nothing more than hopelessly hers. Before that she had made herself transparent so that I could write.... Mixing-up of roles. For months long I had been her mother. I felt like I had lost a daughter.

He grieved his mothers death for the rest of his life Do not say mourning. Its too psychoanalytic. Im not in mourning. Im suffering. and In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden where she had died and where I now sleep in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hung an iconnot out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away.

In 2012 the book Travels in China was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal Tel Quel in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed as he found China not at all exotic not at all disorienting.

Roland Barthess criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as structuralism semiotics and post-structuralism. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication including computers photography music and literature.

Readerly and writerly are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into ones experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in SZ while the essay From Work to Text from ImageMusicText provides an analogous parallel look at the activepassive and postmodernmodern ways of interacting with a text.

A text that makes no requirement of the reader to write or produce their own meanings. The reader may passively locate ready-made meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are controlled by the principle of non-contradiction that is they do not disturb the common sense or Doxa of the surrounding culture. The readerly texts moreover are products safeguarded .

A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism ... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text . Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute in short an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts Barthes writes should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the readerly texts as product the writerly text is ourselves writing before the infinite play of the world is traversed intersected stopped plasticized by some singular system which reduces the plurality of entrances the opening of networks the infinity of languages . Thus reading becomes for Barthes not a parasitical act the reactive complement of a writing but rather a form of work .

Author and scriptor are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. The author is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of hisher original imagination. For Barthes such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought including the insights of Surrealism have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the scriptor whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts norms and conventions and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writers biography compared to these textual and generic conventions Barthes says that the scriptor has no past but is born with the text. He also argues that in the absence of the idea of an author-God to control the meaning of a work interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it the death of the author is the birth of the reader.

In 1964 Barthes wrote The Last Happy Writer the title of which refers to Voltaire. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthess description of Voltaire Daniel Gordon the translator and editor of Candide wrote that never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another.

The sinologist Simon Leys in a review of Barthess diary of a trip to China during the Cultural Revolution disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people and says that Barthes has contrivedamazinglyto bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity so long unjustly disparaged of saying nothing at great length.

Barthess A Lovers Discourse Fragments was the inspiration for the name of 1980s new wave duo The Lover Speaks.

Jeffrey Eugenides The Marriage Plot draws out excerpts from Barthess A Lovers Discourse Fragments as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters Madeleine Hanna experiences throughout the novel.

In the film Birdman by Alejandro González Iñárritu a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from Mythologies The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters.

In the film The Truth About Cats Dogs by Michael Lehmann Brian is reading an extract from Camera Lucida over the phone to a woman whom he thinks to be beautiful but who is her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend.

In the film Elegy based on Philip Roths novel The Dying Animal the character of Consuela is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthess The Pleasure of the Text on the campus of the university where she is a student.

Laurent Binets novel The 7th Function of Language is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the Seventh Function of Language."
Victor Basch,"Basch Viktor Vilém or Victor-Guillaume Basch was a French politician and professor of germanistics and philosophy at the Sorbonne descending from Hungary. He was engaged in the Zionist movement in the Ligue des droits de lhomme and in Anti-Nazism.

His father was the journalist and political activist Raphael Basch. Born in Budapest in 1863 Victor Basch emigrated with his family to France as a child and later studied at the Sorbonne. In 1885 he was appointed professor at the University of Nancy and in 1887 at the University of Rennes where he became friend with Jean Jaurès. During the Dreyfus affair Basch was the leader of the Dreyfusards at Rennes who were placed in a serious and difficult position when the case was tried in that city. Both as a Jew and a Dreyfusard Basch was subjected to persecution at the hands of the fanatical anti-Semitic populace. In a 1916 interview cited by his biographer and granddaughter the French historian Françoise Basch Victor Basch declared Im really a Jew. I struggle and suffered for my Jewishness. However biographer Françoise Basch underscores that her grandfather identified with his family history and the suffering of persecuted Jews and not with Judaism as a religion. As both a member of the League against Imperialism created in Brussels in 1927 and as President of the Ligue des Droits de lHomme from 19261944 Basch was one of the architects of the Popular Front. He fought and suffered for the principles of legal and social justice as well as human rights.

On 10 January 1944 Victor Basch and his wife Ilona Basch aged 81 were taken from their home in Lyon and assassinated by Joseph Lecussan and Henri Gonnet of the antisemitic Vichy French Milice Française under orders of the regional chief Paul Touvier.

He also contributed frequently to the Siècle and the Grande Revue of Paris."
Frédéric Bastiat,"Claude-Frédéric Bastiat was a French economist writer and a prominent member of the French Liberal School.

A member of the French National Assembly Bastiat developed the economic concept of opportunity cost and introduced the parable of the broken window. He was described as the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived by economic theorist Joseph Schumpeter.

As an advocate of classical economics and the economics of Adam Smith his views favored a free market and influenced the Austrian School. He is best known for his book The Law where he argued that law must protect rights such as private property not plunder others property.

Bastiat was born on 29 June 1801 in Bayonne Aquitaine a port town in the south of France on the Bay of Biscay. His father Pierre Bastiat was a prominent businessman in the town. His mother died in 1808 when Frédéric was seven years old. His father moved inland to the town of Mugron with Frédéric following soon afterward. The Bastiat estate in Mugron had been acquired during the French Revolution and had previously belonged to the Marquis of Poyanne. Pierre Bastiat died in 1810 leaving Frédéric an orphan. He was fostered by his paternal grandfather and his unmarried aunt Justine Bastiat. He attended a school in Bayonne but his aunt thought poorly of it and so enrolled him in the school Saint-Sever. At age 17 he left school at Sorèze to work for his uncle in his familys export business. It was the same firm where his father had been a partner.

Bastiat began to develop an intellectual interest as he no longer wished to work with his uncle and desired to go to Paris for formal studies. This hope was not realized as his grandfather was in poor health and wished to go to the Mugron estate. Bastiat accompanied him and cared for him. The next year when Bastiat was 24 his grandfather died leaving him the family estate thereby providing him with the means to further his theoretical inquiries. Bastiat developed intellectual interests in several areas including philosophy history politics religion travel poetry political economy and biography. After the middle-class Revolution of 1830 Bastiat became politically active and was elected justice of the peace of Mugron in 1831 and to the Council General of Landes in 1832. Bastiat was elected to the national legislative assembly after the French Revolution of 1848.

His public career as an economist began only in 1844 when his first article was published in the Journal des économistes during October of that year and it was ended by his untimely death in 1850. Bastiat contracted tuberculosis probably during his tours throughout France to promote his ideas and that illness eventually prevented him from making further speeches and ended his life. In The Law he wrote Until the day of my death I shall proclaim this principle with all the force of my lungs .

This last line is understood by translators to be a reference to the effects of his tuberculosis. During the autumn of 1850 he was sent to Italy by his doctors and he first traveled to Pisa then to Rome. On 24 December 1850 Bastiat called those with him to approach his bed and murmured twice the words the truth before he died at the age of 49.

Among his better known works is Economic Sophisms a series of essays which contain a defence of free trade. Bastiat wrote the work while living in England to advise the shapers of the French Republic on perils to avoid. Economic Sophisms was translated and adapted for an American readership in 1867 by the economist and historian of money Alexander del Mar writing under the pseudonym Emile Walter.

Contained within Economic Sophisms is the satirical parable known as the candlemakers petition in which candlemakers and tallow producers lobby the Chamber of Deputies of the French July Monarchy to block out the Sun to prevent its unfair competition with their products. Also included in the Sophisms is a facetious petition to the king asking for a law forbidding the usage of everyones right hand based on a presumption by some of his contemporaries that more difficulty means more work and more work means more wealth.

Socialism like the ancient ideas from which it springs confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this every time we object to a thing being done by government the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.I do not dispute their right to invent social combinations to advertise them to advocate them and to try them upon themselves at their own expense and risk. But I do dispute their right to impose these plans upon us by law by force and to compel us to pay for them with our taxes.

Bastiat posits that the law becomes perverted when it punishes ones right to self-defense in favor of anothers right to legalized plunder which he defines as if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime in which he includes the tax support of protective tariffs subsidies guaranteed profits guaranteed jobs relief and welfare schemes public education progressive taxation free credit and public works. According to Bastiat legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it tariffs protection benefits subsidies encouragements progressive taxation public schools guaranteed jobs guaranteed profits minimum wages a right to relief a right to the tools of labor free credit and so on and so on. All these plans as a whole with their common aim of legal plunder constitute socialism. Bastiat also made the following humorous point If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind

In his 1850 essay Ce quon voit et ce quon ne voit pas Bastiat introduced through the parable of the broken window the concept of opportunity cost in all but name. This term was not coined until over sixty years after his death by Friedrich von Wieser in 1914.

Bastiat also famously engaged in a debate between 1849 and 1850 with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon about the legitimacy of interest. As Robert Leroux argued Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhons anti-interest doctrine was the complete antithesis of any serious approach. Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat Your intelligence is asleep or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy without science without humanity. Your ability to reason like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically Mr. Bastiat you are a dead man.

Bastiat asserted that the sole purpose of government is to protect the right of an individual to life liberty and property and why it is dangerous and morally wrong for government to interfere with an individuals other personal matters. From this Bastiat concluded that the law cannot defend life liberty and property if it promotes legal or legalized plunder which he defined as using government force and laws to take something from one individual and give it to others .

In The Law Bastiat explains that if the privileged classes or socialists use the government for legalized plunder this will encourage the other socioeconomic class to also use legal plunder and that the correct response to the socialists is to cease all legal plunder. Bastiat also explains in The Law why his opinion is that the law cannot defend life liberty and property if it promotes socialist policies. When used to obtain legalized plunder for any group he says that the law is perverted against the only things it is supposed to defend.

Bastiat was a strong supporter of free trade who was inspired by and routinely corresponded with Richard Cobden and the English Anti-Corn Law League and worked with free-trade associations in France.

We cannot doubt that self-interest is the mainspring of human nature. It must be clearly understood that this word is used here to designate a universal incontestable fact resulting from the nature of man and not an adverse judgment as would be the word selfishness.

One of Bastiats most important contributions to economics was his admonition to the effect that good economic decisions can be made only by taking into account the full picture. That is economic truths should be arrived at by observing not only the immediate consequencesthat is benefits or liabilitiesof an economic decision but also by examining the long-term second and third consequences. Additionally one must examine the decisions effect not only on a single group of people or a single industry but on all people and all industries in the society as a whole. As Bastiat famously put it an economist must take into account both What is Seen and What is Not Seen. Bastiats rule was later expounded and developed by Henry Hazlitt in his work Economics in One Lesson in which Hazlitt borrowed Bastiats trenchant broken window fallacy and went on to demonstrate how it applies to a wide variety of economic falsehoods.

A famous section of Economic Sophisms concerns the way that tariffs are inherently counterproductive. Bastiat posits a theoretical railway between Spain and France that is built to reduce the costs of trade between the two countries. This is achieved by making goods move to and from the two nations faster and more easily. Bastiat demonstrates that this situation benefits both countries consumers because it reduces the cost of shipping goods and therefore reduces the price at market for those goods. However each countrys producers begin to criticize their governments because the other countrys producers can now provide certain goods to the domestic market at reduced price. Domestic producers of these goods are afraid of being outcompeted by the newly viable industry from the other country therefore these domestic producers demand that tariffs be enacted to artificially raise the cost of the foreign goods back to their pre-railroad levels so that they can continue to compete. Thus Bastiat makes two significant statements here

To further demonstrate his statements Bastiat suggestsin a classic reductio ad absurdumthat rather than enacting tariffs the government should simply destroy the railroad anywhere that foreign goods can outcompete local goods. Since this would be just about everywhere he goes on to suggest that this government should simply build a broken or negative railroad right from the start and not waste time with tariffs and rail building.

Bastiat died in Rome and is buried at San Luigi dei Francesi in the center of that city. He declared on his deathbed that his friend Gustave de Molinari was his spiritual heir."
Georges Bataille,"Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille was a French philosopher and intellectual working in philosophy literature sociology anthropology consumerism and history of art. His writing which included essays novels and poetry explored such subjects as erotism mysticism surrealism and transgression. His work would prove influential on subsequent schools of philosophy and social theory including poststructuralism.

Georges Bataille was the son of Joseph-Aristide Bataille a tax collector and Antoinette-Aglaë Tournarde . Born on 10 September 1897 in Billom in the region of Auvergne his family moved to Reims in 1898 where he was baptized. He went to school in Reims and then Épernay. Although brought up without religious observance he converted to Catholicism in 1914 and became a devout Catholic for about nine years. He considered entering the priesthood and attended a Catholic seminary briefly. However he quit apparently in part in order to pursue an occupation where he could eventually support his mother. He eventually renounced Christianity in the early 1920s.

Bataille attended the École Nationale des Chartes in Paris graduating in February 1922. He graduated with a bachelors thesis titled Lordre de la chevalerie conte en vers du xiiie siècle avec introduction et notes. Though he is often referred to as an archivist and a librarian because of his employment at the Bibliothèque Nationale his work there was with the medallion collections . His thesis at the École des Chartes was a critical edition of the medieval poem LOrdre de chevalerie which he produced directly by classifying the eight manuscripts from which he reconstructed the poem. After graduating he moved to the School of Advanced Spanish Studies in Madrid. As a young man he befriended and was much influenced by the Russian existentialist Lev Shestov.

Founder of several journals and literary groups Bataille is the author of a large and diverse body of work readings poems essays on innumerable subjects on the mysticism of economy poetry philosophy the arts and eroticism. He sometimes published under pseudonyms and some of his publications were banned. He was relatively ignored during his lifetime and scorned by contemporaries such as Jean-Paul Sartre as an advocate of mysticism but after his death had considerable influence on authors such as Michel Foucault Philippe Sollers and Jacques Derrida all of whom were affiliated with the journal Tel Quel. His influence is felt most explicitly in the phenomenological work of Jean-Luc Nancy but is also significant for the work of Jean Baudrillard the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan and Julia Kristeva and recent anthropological work from the likes of Michael Taussig.

Initially attracted to Surrealism Bataille quickly fell out with its founder André Breton although Bataille and the Surrealists resumed cautiously cordial relations after World War II. Bataille was a member of the extremely influential College of Sociology which included several other renegade surrealists. He was heavily influenced by Hegel Freud Marx Marcel Mauss the Marquis de Sade Alexandre Kojève and Friedrich Nietzsche the last of whom he defended in a notable essay against appropriation by the Nazis.

Fascinated by human sacrifice he founded a secret society Acéphale the symbol of which was a headless man. According to legend Bataille and the other members of Acéphale each agreed to be the sacrificial victim as an inauguration; none of them would agree to be the executioner. An indemnity was offered for an executioner but none was found before the dissolution of Acéphale shortly before the war. The group also published an eponymous review of Nietzsches philosophy which attempted to postulate what Derrida has called an anti-sovereignty. Collaborators in these projects included André Masson Pierre Klossowski Roger Caillois Jules Monnerot Jean Rollin and Jean Wahl.

Bataille drew from diverse influences and used various modes of discourse to create his work. His novel Story of the Eye published under the pseudonym Lord Auch was initially read as pure pornography while interpretation of the work has gradually matured to reveal the same considerable philosophical and emotional depth that is characteristic of other writers who have been categorized within literature of transgression. The imagery of the novel is built upon a series of metaphors which in turn refer to philosophical constructs developed in his work the eye the egg the sun the earth the testicle.

Other famous novels include the posthumously published My Mother The Impossible and Blue of Noon which with its incest necrophilia politics and autobiographical undertones is a much darker treatment of contemporary historical reality.

During World War II Bataille produced Summa Atheologica which comprises his works Inner Experience Guilty and On Nietzsche. After the war he composed The Accursed Share which he said represented thirty years work. The singular conception of sovereignty expounded there would become an important topic of discussion for Derrida Giorgio Agamben Jean-Luc Nancy and others. Bataille also founded the influential journal Critique.

Batailles first marriage was to actress Silvia Maklès in 1928; they divorced in 1934 and she later married the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Bataille also had an affair with Colette Peignot who died in 1938. In 1946 Bataille married Diane de Beauharnais with whom he had a daughter.

In 1955 Bataille was diagnosed with cerebral arteriosclerosis although he was not informed at the time of the terminal nature of his illness. He died seven years later on 9 July 1962.

At the crossroads of knowledge and the great ideological philosophical and anthropological debates of his time his work is both literary and philosophical multiple heterogeneous marginal and escapes labelling the traditional categories the delimitations they establish prove inappropriate or cumbersome when one wants to account for the whole of his writings. All the more so since he went out of his way to blur the lines as he himself declared in his last interview with Madeleine Chapsal in March 1961 I would willingly say that what I am most proud of is having blurred the lines that is to say having associated the most turbulent and shocking way of laughing the most scandalous with the deepest religious spirit . This scrambling is all the more evident because of the multiple versions manuscripts and typescripts of his texts and also because he often used pseudonyms to sign certain writings Troppmann Lord Auch Pierre Angélique Louis Trente and Dianus.

Bataille developed base materialism during the late 1920s and early 1930s as an attempt to break with mainstream materialism which he viewed as a subtle form of idealism. He argues for the concept of an active base matter that disrupts the opposition of high and low and destabilises all foundations. In a sense the concept is similar to Baruch Spinozas neutral monism of a substance that encompasses both the mind and the matter posited by René Descartes; however it defies strict definition and remains in the realm of experience rather than rationalisation. Base materialism was a major influence on Derridas deconstruction and both thinkers attempt to destabilise philosophical oppositions by means of an unstable third term. Batailles notion of materialism may also be seen as anticipating Louis Althussers conception of aleatory materialism or materialism of the encounter which draws on similar atomist metaphors to sketch a world in which causality and actuality are abandoned in favor of limitless possibilities of action.

La Part maudite is a book written by Bataille between 1946 and 1949 when it was published by Les Éditions de Minuit. It was translated into English and published in 1991 with the title The Accursed Share. It presents a new economic theory which Bataille calls general economy as distinct from the restricted economic perspective of most economic theory. Thus in the theoretical introduction Bataille writes the following

I will simply state without waiting further that the extension of economic growth itself requires the overturning of economic principlesthe overturning of the ethics that grounds them. Changing from the perspectives of restrictive economy to those of general economy actually accomplishes a Copernican transformation a reversal of thinkingand of ethics. If a part of wealth is doomed to destruction or at least to unproductive use without any possible profit it is logical even inescapable to surrender commodities without return. Henceforth leaving aside pure and simple dissipation analogous to the construction of the Pyramids the possibility of pursuing growth is itself subordinated to giving The industrial development of the entire world demands of Americans that they lucidly grasp the necessity for an economy such as theirs of having a margin of profitless operations. An immense industrial network cannot be managed in the same way that one changes a tire It expresses a circuit of cosmic energy on which it depends which it cannot limit and whose laws it cannot ignore without consequences. Woe to those who to the very end insist on regulating the movement that exceeds them with the narrow mind of the mechanic who changes a tire.

Thus according to Batailles theory of consumption the accursed share is that excessive and non-recuperable part of any economy which is destined to one of two modes of economic and social expenditure. This must either be spent luxuriously and knowingly without gain in the arts in non-procreative sexuality in spectacles and sumptuous monuments or it is obliviously destined to an outrageous and catastrophic outpouring in war. Though the distinction is less apparent in Hurleys English translation Bataille introduces the neologism consummation to signal this excess expenditure as distinct from consommation .

The notion of excess energy is central to Batailles thinking. Batailles inquiry takes the superabundance of energy beginning from the infinite outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by lifes basic chemical reactions as the norm for organisms. In other words an organism in Batailles general economy unlike the rational actors of classical economy who are motivated by scarcity normally has an excess of energy available to it. This extra energy can be used productively for the organisms growth or it can be lavishly expended. Bataille insists that an organisms growth or expansion always runs up against limits and becomes impossible. The wasting of this energy is luxury. The form and role luxury assumes in a society are characteristic of that society. The accursed share refers to this excess destined for waste.

Crucial to the formulation of the theory was Batailles reflection upon the phenomenon of potlatch. It is influenced by Marcel Mausss The Gift as well as by Friedrich Nietzsches On the Genealogy of Morals.

Charles Batteux,"Charles Batteux was a French philosopher and writer on aesthetics.

Batteux was born in AllandHuy-et-Sausseuil Ardennes and studied theology at Reims. In 1739 he came to Paris and after teaching in the colleges of Lisieux and Navarre was appointed to the chair of Greek and Roman philosophy in the Collège de France. His 1746 treatise Les beaux arts réduits à un même principe was an attempt to find a unity among existing theories of beauty and taste on a single principle and its views were widely accepted not only in France but throughout Europe.

The reputation thus gained confirmed by his translation of Horace led to Batteuxs becoming a member of the Académie des Inscriptions and of the Académie française . His Cours de belles lettres was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise Principes de la littérature . His philosophical writings were La morale dÉpicure tirée de ses propres écrits and the Histoire des causes premières . In consequence of the freedom with which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy he lost his professorial chair. His last and most extensive work was a Cours détudes à lusage des élèves de lécole militaire in forty-five volumes.

In Les Beaux Arts Batteux developed a theory influenced by John Locke through Voltaires sceptical sensualism. He held that the fine arts are arts for producing fine or beautiful things always in imitation of la belle nature and requiring genius. Applying this principle to the art of poetry and analysing line by line and even word by word the works of great poets he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy beauty and harmony of individual expression. His Histoire des causes premières was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy and in his work on Epicurus following on Gassendi he defended Epicureanism against the general attacks made against it.For his work La Morale dÉpicure 1758 see A. ToscanoLa Morale dÉpicure di Charles Batteux ed il principio del secondo natura in Scienze e Ricerche n. 42 1 dicembre 2016 ISSN 2283-5873 pp. 20-29.

Strictly in Aesthetics terms Batteux sets the single principle for fine arts in imitation of nature and this in terms of ideal of perfection to make an harmonious whole lets choose the most beautiful parts of nature to make an exquisite whole more perfect then nature but never ending to be natural. In this concept clearly Batteux follows a long tradition present at least in Leon Battista Alberti; as well as for the expression of fine arts present in Giovanni Battista Armenini and more back in Sebastiano Serlio."
Jean C. Baudet,"Jean C. Baudet is a Belgian philosopher and writer born in Brussels .

J.C. Baudet taught philosophy and history of science from 1966 to 1973 in Africa .From 1973 to 1978 he was a biology researcher . In 1978 he was the founder of the periodical Technologia .Since 1996 he was an editor of the Revue Générale . The philosophical system developed by J.C. Baudet is known as editology.

Science-Technics-Industry is a philosophical concept proposed by the Belgian philosopher Jean C. Baudet. The objective of STI is to distinguish the rational cultural productions from the emotional or imaginary ones. Emotional and imaginary cultural productions lead to ideologies andor ethical and politically illusive constructions. STI is a key-concept in editology. It may be seen as an elaborate philosophical generalization of the economical notion of science and industry. In the STI technics are the interface between science and industry and thus between knowledge and practice .

Editology is the epistemological system developed by Baudet. The main characteristic of the editology is to define the knowledge as a set of texts discourses and to assign the scientificity of those texts to the very conditions of their edition - the manner they are accepted by the international scientific community. It has two purposes understand the terms and analyze the edition .

This philosophical approach leads to a conception of the knowledge which admits that the hard core of rationalism is the epistemological complex STI . An important consequence of the editological thought is to establish an historical critic of the successive discourses which characterize the milestones of the human thinking literature religion and later philosophy. In that sense the philosophy is defined as a discourse rejecting all the discourses."
Jean Baudrillard,"Jean Baudrillard was a French sociologist philosopher and cultural theorist. He is best known for his analyses of media contemporary culture and technological communication as well as his formulation of concepts such as simulation and hyperreality. He wrote about diverse subjects including consumerism gender relations critique of economy economics social history art Western foreign policy and popular culture. Among his best known works are Seduction Simulacra and Simulation America and The Gulf War Did Not Take Place . His work is frequently associated with postmodernism and specifically post-structuralism. Nevertheless Baudrillard can be also seen as a critic of post-structuralism and has distanced himself from postmodernism.

Baudrillard was born in Reims northeastern France on 27 July 1929. His grandparents were farm workers and his father a gendarme. During high school he became aware of pataphysics via philosophy professor Emmanuel Peillet which is said to be crucial for understanding Baudrillards later thought. He became the first of his family to attend university when he moved to Paris to attend the Sorbonne. There he studied German language and literature which led him to begin teaching the subject at several different lycées both Parisian and provincial from 1960 until 1966. While teaching Baudrillard began to publish reviews of literature and translated the works of such authors as Peter Weiss Bertolt Brecht Karl Marx Friedrich Engels and Wilhelm Emil Mühlmann.

While teaching German Baudrillard began to transfer to sociology eventually completing and publishing in 1968 his doctoral thesis Le Système des Objets under the dissertation committee of Henri Lefebvre Roland Barthes and Pierre Bourdieu. Subsequently he began teaching Sociology at the Paris X Nanterre a university campus just outside Paris which would become heavily involved in the events of May 1968. During this time Baudrillard worked closely with Philosopher Humphrey De Battenburge who described Baudrillard as a visionary. At Nanterre he took up a position as Maître Assistant then Maître de Conférences eventually becoming a professor after completing his accreditation LAutre par lui-même .

In 1970 Baudrillard made the first of his many trips to the United States and in 1973 the first of several trips to Kyoto Japan. He was given his first camera in 1981 in Japan which led to his becoming a photographer.

In 1986 he moved to IRIS at the Université de Paris-IX Dauphine where he spent the latter part of his teaching career. During this time he had begun to move away from sociology as a discipline and after ceasing to teach full-time he rarely identified himself with any particular discipline although he remained linked to academia. During the 1980s and 1990s his books had gained a wide audience and in his last years he became to an extent an intellectual celebrity being published often in the French- and English-speaking popular press. He nonetheless continued supporting the Institut de Recherche sur lInnovation Sociale at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and was Satrap at the Collège de Pataphysique. Baudrillard taught at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee Switzerland and collaborated at the Canadian theory culture and technology review Ctheory where he was abundantly cited. He also participated in the International Journal of Baudrillard Studies from its inception in 2004 until his death. In 19992000 his photographs were exhibited at the Maison européenne de la photographie in Paris. In 2004 Baudrillard attended the major conference on his work Baudrillard and the Arts at the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe Germany.

Baudrillard enjoyed baroque music; a favorite composer was Claudio Monteverdi. He also favored rock music such as The Velvet Underground Nico.

Baudrillard was married twice. He and his first wife Lucile Baudrillard had two children Gilles and Anne.

In 1970 during his first marriage Baudrillard met 25 year old Marine Dupuis when she arrived at the Paris Nanterre University where he was a professor. Marine went on to be a media artistic director. They married in 1994 when he was 65.

Diagnosed with cancer in 2005 Baudrillard battled the disease two years from his apartment on Rue Sainte-Beuve Paris dying at the age of 77. Marine Baudrillard curates Cool Memories an association of Jean Baudrillards friends.

Baudrillards published work emerged as part of a generation of French thinkers including Gilles Deleuze Jean-François Lyotard Michel Foucault Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan who all shared an interest in semiotics and he is often seen as a part of the post-structuralist philosophical school. In common with many post-structuralists his arguments consistently draw upon the notion that signification and meaning are both only understandable in terms of how particular words or signs interrelate. Baudrillard thought as do many post-structuralists that meaning is brought about through systems of signs working together. Following on from the structuralist linguist Ferdinand de Saussure Baudrillard argued that meaning is created through differencethrough what something is not . In fact he viewed meaning as near enough self-referential objects images of objects words and signs are situated in a web of meaning; one objects meaning is only understandable through its relation to the meaning of other objects; for instance one things prestige relates to anothers mundanity.

From this starting point Baudrillard theorized broadly about human society based upon this kind of self-referentiality. His writing portrays societies always searching for a sense of meaningor a total understanding of the worldthat remains consistently elusive. In contrast to Post-structuralism for whom the formations of knowledge emerge only as the result of relations of power Baudrillard developed theories in which the excessive fruitless search for total knowledge leads almost inevitably to a kind of delusion. In Baudrillards view the subject may try to understand the object but because the object can only be understood according to what it signifies this never produces the desired results. The subject is rather seduced by the object. He argued therefore that in the final analysis a complete understanding of the minutiae of human life is impossible and when people are seduced into thinking otherwise they become drawn toward a simulated version of reality or to use one of his neologisms a state of hyperreality. This is not to say that the world becomes unreal but rather that the faster and more comprehensively societies begin to bring reality together into one supposedly coherent picture the more insecure and unstable it looks and the more fearful societies become. Reality in this sense dies out.

Accordingly Baudrillard argued that the excess of signs and of meaning in late 20th century global society had caused an effacement of reality. In this world neither liberal nor Marxist utopias are any longer believed in. We live he argued not in a global village to use Marshall McLuhans phrase but rather in a world that is ever more easily petrified by even the smallest event. Because the global world operates at the level of the exchange of signs and commodities it becomes ever more blind to symbolic acts such as for example terrorism. In Baudrillards work the symbolic realm is seen as quite distinct from that of signs and signification. Signs can be exchanged like commodities; symbols on the other hand operate quite differently they are exchanged like gifts sometimes violently as a form of potlatch. Baudrillard particularly in his later work saw the global society as without this symbolic element and therefore symbolically defenseless against acts such as the Rushdie Fatwa or indeed the September 11 terrorist attacks against the United States and its military and economic establishment.

In his early books such as The System of Objects For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign and The Consumer Society Baudrillards main focus is upon consumerism and how different objects are consumed in different ways. At this time Baudrillards political outlook was loosely associated with Marxism but in these books he differed from Karl Marx in one significant way. For Baudrillard as for the situationists it was consumption rather than production that was the main driver of capitalist society.

Baudrillard came to this conclusion by criticising Marxs concept of use-value. Baudrillard thought that both Marxs and Adam Smiths economic thought accepted the idea of genuine needs relating to genuine uses too easily and too simply. Baudrillard argued drawing from Georges Bataille that needs are constructed rather than innate. He stressed that all purchases because they always signify something socially have their fetishistic side. Objects always drawing from Roland Barthes say something about their users. And this was for him why consumption was and remains more important than production because the ideological genesis of needs precedes the production of goods to meet those needs.

He wrote that there are four ways of an object obtaining value. The four value-making processes are

Baudrillards earlier books were attempts to argue that the first two of these values are not simply associated but are disrupted by the third and particularly the fourth. Later Baudrillard rejected Marxism totally . But the focus on the difference between sign value and symbolic value remained in his work up until his death. Indeed it came to play a more and more important role particularly in his writings on world events.

As Baudrillard developed his work throughout the 1980s he moved from economic theory to mediation and mass communication. Although retaining his interest in Saussurean semiotics and the logic of symbolic exchange Baudrillard turned his attention to the work of Marshall McLuhan developing ideas about how the nature of social relations is determined by the forms of communication that a society employs. In so doing Baudrillard progressed beyond both Saussures and Roland Barthess formal semiology to consider the implications of a historically understood version of structural semiology. According to Kornelije Kvas Baudrillard rejects the structuralist principle of the equivalence of different forms of linguistic organization the binary principle that contains oppositions such as true-false real-unreal center-periphery. He denies any possibility of a duplication of reality; reality mediated through language becomes a game of signs. In his theoretical system all distinctions between the real and the fictional between a copy and the original disappear.

Simulation Baudrillard claims is the current stage of the simulacrum all is composed of references with no referents a hyperreality. Baudrillard argues that this is part of a historical progression. In the Renaissance the dominant simulacrum was in the form of the counterfeit where people or objects appear to stand for a real referent that does not exist . With the Industrial Revolution the dominant simulacrum becomes the product which can be propagated on an endless production line. In current times the dominant simulacrum is the model which by its nature already stands for endless reproducibility and is itself already reproduced.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s one of Baudrillards most common themes was historicity or more specifically how present-day societies utilise the notions of progress and modernity in their political choices. He argued much like the political theorist Francis Fukuyama that history had ended or vanished with the spread of globalization; but unlike Fukuyama Baudrillard averred that this end should not be understood as the culmination of historys progress but as the collapse of the very idea of historical progress. For Baudrillard the end of the Cold War did not represent an ideological victory; rather it signaled the disappearance of utopian visions shared between both the political Right and Left. Giving further evidence of his opposition toward Marxist visions of global communism and liberal visions of global civil society Baudrillard contended that the ends they hoped for had always been illusions; indeed as The Illusion of the End argues he thought the idea of an end itself was nothing more than a misguided dream

The end of history is alas also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies old regimes old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism which actually invented the dustbins of history Conclusion if there are no more dustbins of history this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.

Within a society subject to and ruled by fast-paced electronic communication and global information networks the collapse of this façade was always going to be he thought inevitable. Employing a quasi-scientific vocabulary that attracted the ire of the physicist Alan Sokal Baudrillard wrote that the speed society moved at had destabilized the linearity of history we have the particle accelerator that has smashed the referential orbit of things once and for all.

In making this argument Baudrillard found some affinity with the postmodern philosophy of Jean-François Lyotard who argued that in the late 20th century there was no longer any room for metanarratives. But in addition to simply lamenting this collapse of history Baudrillard also went beyond Lyotard and attempted to analyse how the idea of positive progress was being employed in spite of the notions declining validity. Baudrillard argued that although genuine belief in a universal endpoint of history wherein all conflicts would find their resolution had been deemed redundant universality was still a notion utilised in world politics as an excuse for actions. Universal values which according to him no one any longer believed universal were and are still rhetorically employed to justify otherwise unjustifiable choices. The means he wrote are there even though the ends are no longer believed in and are employed in order to hide the presents harsh realities . In the Enlightenment universalization was viewed as unlimited growth and forward progress. Today by contrast universalization is expressed as a forward escape. This involves the notion of escape velocity as outlined in The Vital Illusion which in turn results in the postmodern fallacy of escape velocity on which the postmodern mind and critical view cannot by definition ever truly break free from the all-encompassing self-referential sphere of discourse.

Baudrillard reacted to the Wests indifference to the Bosnian War in writings mostly in essays in his column for Libération. More specifically he expressed his view on Europes unwillingness to respond to aggression and genocide in Bosnia in which New Europe revealed itself to be a sham. He criticized the Western media and intellectuals for their passivity and for taking the role of bystanders engaging in ineffective hypocritical and self-serving action and the public for its inability to distinguish simulacra from real world happenings in which real death and destruction in Bosnia seemed unreal. He was determined in his columns to openly name the perpetrators Serbs and call their actions in Bosnia aggression and genocide.

Baudrillards provocative 1991 book The Gulf War Did Not Take Place raised his public profile as an academic and political commentator. He argued that the first Gulf War was the inverse of the Clausewitzian formula not the continuation of politics by other means but the continuation of the absence of politics by other means. Accordingly Saddam Hussein was not fighting the Coalition but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power. The Coalition fighting the Iraqi military was merely dropping 10000 tonnes of bombs daily as if proving to themselves that there was an enemy to fight. So too were the Western media complicit presenting the war in real time by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led Coalition and the Iraqi government were actually fighting but such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity . His power was not weakened evinced by his easy suppression of the 1991 internal uprisings that followed afterwards. Over all little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated the victors were not victorious and thus there was no wari.e. the Gulf War did not occur.

The book was originally a series of articles in the British newspaper The Guardian and the French newspaper Libération published in three parts The Gulf War Will Not Take Place published during the American military and rhetorical buildup; The Gulf War Is Not Taking Place published during military action; and The Gulf War Did Not Take Place published afterwards.

Some critics. Consequently Baudrillard was accused of lazy amoralism cynical scepticism and Berkelian subjective idealism. Sympathetic commentators such as William Merrin in his book Baudrillard and the Media have argued that Baudrillard was more concerned with the Wests technological and political dominance and the globalization of its commercial interests and what that means for the present possibility of war. Merrin argued that Baudrillard was not denying that something had happened but merely questioning whether that something was in fact war or a bilateral atrocity masquerading as a war. Merrin viewed the accusations of amorality as redundant and based on a misreading. In Baudrillards own words

Saddam liquidates the communists Moscow flirts even more with him; he gases the Kurds it is not held against him; he eliminates the religious cadres the whole of Islam makes peace with him.Eventhe 100000 dead will only have been the final decoy that Saddam will have sacrificed the blood money paid in forfeit according to a calculated equivalence in order to preserve his power. What is worse is that these dead still serve as an alibi for those who do not want to have been excited for nothing at least these dead will prove this war was indeed a war and not shameful and pointless.

In contrast to the non-event of the Gulf War in his essay The Spirit of Terrorism Baudrillard characterises the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City as the absolute event. Seeking to understand them as a reaction to the technological and political expansion of capitalist globalization rather than as a war of religiously based or civilization-based warfare he described the absolute event and its consequences as follows

This is not a clash of civilisations or religions and it reaches far beyond Islam and America on which efforts are being made to focus the conflict in order to create the delusion of a visible confrontation and a solution based upon force. There is indeed a fundamental antagonism here but one that points past the spectre of America and the spectre of Islam to triumphant globalisation battling against itself.

In accordance with his theory of society Baudrillard portrayed the attacks as a symbolic reaction to the inexorable rise of a world based on commodity exchange. This stance was criticised on two counts. Richard Wolin forcefully accused Baudrillard and Slavoj Žižek of all but celebrating the terrorist attacks essentially claiming that the United States received what it deserved. Žižek however countered that accusation to Wolins analysis as a form of intellectual barbarism in the journal Critical Inquiry saying that Wolin failed to see the difference between fantasising about an event and stating that one is deserving of that event. Merrin argued that Baudrillards position affords the terrorists a type of moral superiority. In the journal Economy and Society Merrin further noted that Baudrillard gives the symbolic facets of society unfair privilege above semiotic concerns. Second authors questioned whether the attacks were unavoidable. Bruno Latour in Critical Inquiry argued that Baudrillard believed that their destruction was forced by the society that created them alluding to the notion that the Towers were brought down by their own weight. In Latours view this was because Baudrillard conceived only of society in terms of a symbolic and semiotic dualism.

During 2005 Baudrillard wrote three short pieces and gave a brief magazine interview all treating similar ideas; following his death in 2007 the four pieces were collected and published posthumously as The Agony of Power a polemic against power itself. The first piece From Domination to Hegemony contrasts its two subjects modes of power; domination stands for historical traditional power relations while hegemony stands for modern more sophisticated power relations as realized by states and businesses. Baudrillard decried the cynicism with which contemporary businesses openly state their business models. For example he cited French television channel TF1 executive Patrick Le Lay who stated that his business job was to help Coca-Cola sell its products. Baudrillard lamented that such honesty pre-empted and thus robbed the Left of its traditional role of critiquing governments and businesses In fact Le Lay takes away the only power we had left. He steals our denunciation. Consequently Baudrillard stated that power itself must be abolishedand not solely in the refusal to be dominatedbut also just as violently in the refusal to dominate.

We throw this indifference and abjection at others like a challenge the challenge to defile themselves in return to deny their values to strip naked confess admitto respond to a nihilism equal to our own.

One of Baudrillards editors Mark Poster was among a number of academics who argued for his contemporary relevance; he remarked

Baudrillards writing up to the mid-1980s is open to several criticisms. He fails to define key terms such as the code; his writing style is hyperbolic and declarative often lacking sustained systematic analysis when it is appropriate; he totalizes his insights refusing to qualify or delimit his claims. He writes about particular experiences television images as if nothing else in society mattered extrapolating a bleak view of the world from that limited base. He ignores contradictory evidence such as the many benefits afforded by the new media

Poster also attempted to refute the most extreme of Baudrillards critics the likes of Alan Sokal and Christopher Norris who see him as a purveyor of a form of reality-denying irrationalism

Baudrillard is not disputing the trivial issue that reason remains operative in some actions that if I want to arrive at the next block for example I can assume a Newtonian universe plan a course of action carry out the action and finally fulfill my goal by arriving at the point in question. What is in doubt is that this sort of thinking enables a historically informed grasp of the present in general. According to Baudrillard it does not. The concurrent spread of the hyperreal through the media and the collapse of liberal and Marxist politics as the master narratives deprives the rational subject of its privileged access to truth. In an important sense individuals are no longer citizens eager to maximise their civil rights nor proletarians anticipating the onset of communism. They are rather consumers and hence the prey of objects as defined by the code.

The otherDouglas Kellners Jean Baudrillard From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyondseeks rather to analyse Baudrillards relation to postmodernism and to present a Marxist counter. Regarding the former William Merrin published more than one denunciation of Norris position. The latter Baudrillard himself characterised as reductive.

Native American writer Gerald Vizenor who has made extensive use of Baudrillards concepts of simulation in his critical work.

The Wachowskis said that Baudrillard influenced The Matrix and Neo hides money and disks containing information in Simulacra and Simulation. One critic wondered whether Baudrillard who had not embraced the movie was thinking of suing for a screen credit but Baudrillard himself disclaimed any connection to The Matrix calling it at best a misreading of his ideas.

Some reviewers have noted that Charlie Kaufmans film Synecdoche New York seems inspired by Baudrillards Simulacra and Simulation.

Album Why Hasnt Everything Already Disappeared by rock band Deerhunter was purportedly influenced by Baudrillards essay of the same name."
Louis Eugène Marie Bautain,"Louis Eugène Marie Bautain was a French philosopher and theologian.

Bautain was born at Paris. At the École Normale he came under the influence of Victor Cousin. In 1816 he adopted the profession of higher teaching and was soon after called to the chair of philosophy in the University of Strasbourg. He held this position for many years and gave a parallel course of lectures as professor of the literary faculty in the same city. The reaction against speculative philosophy which carried away De Maistre and Lamennais influenced him also.

In 1828 he took orders and resigned his chair at the university. For several years he remained at Strasbourg lecturing at the Faculty and at the college of Juilly but in 1849 he set out for Paris as vicar of the diocese. At Paris he obtained considerable reputation as an orator and in 1853 was made professor of moral theology at the theological faculty. This post he held till his death.

Like the Scholastics he distinguished reason and faith and held that revelation supplies facts otherwise unattainable which philosophy is able to group by scientific methods. Theology and philosophy thus form one comprehensive science. Yet Bautain was no rationalist; like Pascal and Newman he exalted faith above reason. He pointed out following chiefly the Kantian criticism that reason can never yield knowledge of things in themselves. But there exists in addition to reason another faculty which may be called intelligence through which we are put in connection with spiritual and invisible truth. This intelligence does not of itself yield a body of truth; it merely contains the germs of the higher ideas and these are made productive by being brought into contact with revealed facts. This fundamental conception Bautain worked out in the departments of psychology and morals.

The details of this theology are highly imaginative. He says for instance that there is a spirit of the world and a spirit of nature; the latter gives birth to a physical and psychical spirit and the physical spirit to the animal and vegetable spirits. His theories may well be compared with the arbitrary mysticism of van Helmont and the Gnostics. "
Pierre Bayle,"Pierre Bayle was a French philosopher author and lexicographer. A Huguenot Bayle fled to the Dutch Republic in 1681 because of religious persecution in France. He is best known for his Historical and Critical Dictionary whose publication began in 1697. Bayle was a notable advocate of religious toleration and his skeptical philosophy had a significant influence on the subsequent growth and development of the European Age of Enlightenment. Bayle is commonly regarded as a forerunner of the Encyclopédistes of the mid-18th century.

Bayle was born at Carla-le-Comte near Pamiers Ariège France. He was educated by his father a Calvinist minister and at an academy at Puylaurens. He afterwards entered a Jesuit college at Toulouse and became a Roman Catholic a month later . After seventeen months he returned to Calvinism and fled to Geneva.

There he became acquainted with the teachings of René Descartes. He returned to France and went to Paris where for some years he worked under the name of Bèle as a tutor for various families. In 1675 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Protestant Academy of Sedan. In 1681 the university at Sedan was suppressed by the government in action against Protestants.

Just before that event Bayle had fled to the Dutch Republic where he almost immediately was appointed professor of philosophy and history at the École Illustre in Rotterdam. He taught for many years but became embroiled in a long internal quarrel in the college which resulted in Bayle being deprived of his chair in 1693.

Bayle remained in Rotterdam until his death on 28 December 1706. He was buried in Rotterdam in the Walloon church where Pierre Jurieu would also be buried seven years later. After the demolition of this church in 1922 the graves were relocated to the Crooswijk General Cemetery in Rotterdam. A memorial stone shows that Pierre Bayle is in these graves.

At Rotterdam Bayle published his famous Reflections on Comets in 1682 as well as his critique of Louis Maimbourgs work on the history of Calvinism. The reputation achieved by this critique stirred the envy of Pierre Jurieu Bayles Calvinist colleague of both Sedan and Rotterdam who had written a book on the same subject.

Between 1684 and 1687 Bayle published his Nouvelles de la république des lettres a journal of literary criticism. In 1686 Bayle published the first two volumes of Philosophical Commentary an early plea for toleration in religious matters. This was followed by volumes three and four in 1687 and 1688.

In 1690 there appeared a work entitled Avis important aux refugies which Jurieu attributed to Bayle whom he attacked with great animosity. After losing his chair Bayle engaged in the preparation of his massive Dictionnaire Historique et Critique which effectively constituted one of the first encyclopaedias of ideas and their originators. In the Dictionary Bayle expressed his view that much that was considered to be truth was actually just opinion and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent. The Dictionary would remain an important scholarly work for several generations after its publication.

The remaining years of Bayles life were devoted to miscellaneous writings; in many cases he was responding to criticisms made of his Dictionary.

Voltaire in the prelude to his Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne calls Bayle le plus grand dialecticien qui ait jamais écrit the greatest dialectician to have ever written.

The Nouvelles de la république des lettres was the first thorough-going attempt to popularise literature and it was eminently successful. His multi-volume Historical and Critical Dictionary constitutes Bayles masterpiece. The English translation of The Dictionary by Bayles fellow Huguenot exile Pierre des Maizeaux was identified by American President Thomas Jefferson to be among the one hundred foundational texts to form the first collection of the Library of Congress.

Bayle advanced arguments for religious toleration in his Dictionnaire historique and critique and Commentaire Philosophique. Bayle rejected the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel. He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state; on the contrary 

It will be an everlasting subject of wonder to persons who know what philosophy is to find that Aristotles authority had been so much respected in the schools for several ages that when a disputant quoted a passage from that philosopher he who maintained the thesis durst not say Transeat but must either deny the passage or explain it in his own wayjust as we treat the Holy Scriptures in the divinity schools. The parliaments which have proscribed all other philosophy but that of Aristotle are more excusable than the doctors; for whether the members of the parliament were really persuaded that that philosophy was the best of any or whether they were not the public good might have induced them to prohibit the new opinions for fear the academical divisions should spread their malignant influences on the tranquility of the state.

Richard Popkin has advanced the view that Pierre Bayle was a skeptic who used the Historical and Critical Dictionary to criticise all prior known theories and philosophies. In Bayles view humans were inherently incapable of achieving true knowledge. Because of the limitations of human reason men should adhere instead to their conscience alone. Bayle was critical of many influential rationalists such as René Descartes Thomas Hobbes Baruch Spinoza Nicolas Malebranche and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz."
Jean Beaufret,"Jean Beaufret was a French philosopher and Germanist tremendously influential in the reception of Martin Heideggers work in France.

After graduating from the École Normale Supérieure and completing military service Beaufret passed his agrégation de philosophie in 1933 and undertook a career teaching as a lycée philosophy instructor. His early philosophical interests were in 19th century German philosophy particularly GWF Hegel Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Karl Marx. In the period before the Second World War he came to know Paul Éluard Maurice Merleau-Ponty André Breton and Paul Valéry. During the war he was a prisoner and escaped. Then he became a member of the Resistance near the city of Lyon in the Service Périclès.

In 1946 as Heideggers continued teaching privileges came into question by the denazification committees he made Beaufrets acquaintance. Beaufret engaged Heidegger on the development of French existentialism and Heidegger wrote the Letter on Humanism to Beaufret in response. Beaufret took his students to visit Heidegger at Todtnauberg in 1947 following a month-long Franco-German academic exchange at Freiburg im Breisgau while Baden-Württemberg was still under French occupation. Jean-François Lyotard one of the group of students on the trip selected to visit Heidegger wrote about the experience thus

Beaufret remained a close associate of Heideggers and it was through Beaufret that Heidegger became aware of Jacques Derridas work.

He was a legendary professor of philosophy having trained generations of students and future professors .

Beaufret is considered the wellspring of orthodox French Heideggerianism which was the element of French philosophy that was most dismissive of Heideggers involvement with National Socialism after the French publication in 1987 of Víctor Faríass Heidegger and Nazism. One reason for Beaufrets dismissal of Farías may have been the latters revealing that Beaufret according to Farías had written in agreement with the holocaust denial of Robert Faurisson . In a letter sent to Faurisson Beaufret is quoted as saying"
Simone de Beauvoir,"Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir ; 9 January 1908 14 April 1986 was a French writer intellectual existentialist philosopher political activist feminist socialist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher and even though she was not considered one at the time of her death she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory.

Beauvoir wrote novels essays biographies autobiographies and monographs on philosophy politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex a detailed analysis of womens oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels including She Came to Stay and The Mandarins. Her most enduring contribution to literature is her memoirs notably the first volume Mémoires dune jeune fille rangée which have a warmth and descriptive power. She won the 1954 Prix Goncourt the 1975 Jerusalem Prize and the 1978 Austrian State Prize for European Literature. She was also known for her open lifelong relationship with French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre though this relationship led to a discounting of Beauvoir as an original thinker in some cases.

Beauvoir was born on 9 January 1908 into a bourgeois Parisian family in the 6th arrondissement. Her parents were Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir a lawyer who once aspired to be an actor and Françoise Beauvoir a wealthy bankers daughter and devout Catholic. Simones sister Hélène was born two years later. The family struggled to maintain their bourgeois status after losing much of their fortune shortly after World War I and Françoise insisted the two daughters be sent to a prestigious convent school.

Beauvoir was intellectually precocious fueled by her fathers encouragement; he reportedly would boast Simone thinks like a man Because of her familys straitened circumstances she could no longer rely on her dowry and like other middle-class girls of her age her marriage opportunities were put at risk. She took this opportunity to take steps towards earning a living for herself.

She first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Lévi-Strauss when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled she sat in on courses at the École Normale Supérieure in preparation for the agrégation in philosophy a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for it that she met École Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre Paul Nizan and René Maheu . The jury for the agrégation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of Beauvoir who placed second and at age 21 was the youngest person ever to pass the exam.

Writing of her youth in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter she said...my fathers individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mothers teaching. This disequilibrium which made my life a kind of endless disputation is the main reason why I became an intellectual.

Beauvoir pursued post-secondary education after completing her high school years at Lycée Fenelon. After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925 she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literaturelanguages at the Institut Sainte-Marie

Beauvoir was raised in a strict Catholic household. She had been sent to convent schools as a youth. She was deeply religious as a child at one point intending to become a nun. At age 14 Beauvoir questioned her faith as she saw many changes in the world after witnessing tragedies throughout her life. She abandoned her faith in her early teens and remained an atheist for the rest of her life. Beauvoir quotes Faith allows an evasion of those difficulties which the atheist confronts honestly. And to crown all the believer derives a sense of great superiority from this very cowardice itself.

From 1929 until 1943 Beauvoir taught at the lycée level until she could support herself solely on the earnings of her writings. She taught at the Lycée Montgrand .

Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre met during her college years. Intrigued by her determination as an educator he sought out to make their relationship romantic. However she had no interest in doing so. During October 1929 Jean-Paul Sartre and Beauvoir became a couple and after they were confronted by her father Sartre asked her to marry him on a provisional basis One day while they were sitting on a bench outside the Louvre he said Lets sign a two-year lease. Though Beauvoir wrote Marriage was impossible. I had no dowry scholars point out that her ideal relationships described in The Second Sex and elsewhere bore little resemblances to the marriage standards of the day. Instead she and Sartre entered into a lifelong soul partnership which was sexual but not exclusive nor did it involve living together.

Sartre and Beauvoir always read each others work. Debate continues about the extent to which they influenced each other in their existentialist works such as Sartres Being and Nothingness and Beauvoirs She Came to Stay and Phenomenology and Intent. However recent studies of Beauvoirs work focus on influences other than Sartre including Hegel and Leibniz. The Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers including Sartre to discover Hegels Phenomenology of Spirit. However Beauvoir reading Hegel in German during the war produced an original critique of his dialectic of consciousness.

Beauvoirs prominent open relationships at times overshadowed her substantial academic reputation. A scholar lecturing with her chastised their distinguished every question asked about Sartre concerned his work while all those asked about Beauvoir concerned her personal life. Beginning in 1929 Beauvoir and Sartre were partners and remained so for 51 years until his death in 1980. She chose never to marry and never had children. This gave her the time to advance her education and engage in political causes write and teach and take lovers. She lived with Claude Lanzmann from 1952 to 1959.

Perhaps her most famous lover was American author Nelson Algren whom she met in Chicago in 1947 and to whom she wrote across the Atlantic as my beloved husband. Algren won the National Book Award for The Man with the Golden Arm in 1950 and in 1954 Beauvoir won Frances most prestigious literary prize for The Mandarins in which Algren is the character Lewis Brogan. Algren vociferously objected to their intimacy becoming public. Years after they separated she was buried wearing his gift of a silver ring.

Beauvoir was bisexual and her relationships with young women were controversial. French author Bianca Lamblin wrote in her book Mémoires dune Jeune Fille Dérangée that while a student at Lycée Molière she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir who was in her 30s. Lamblin had affairs with both Jean-Paul Sartre and Beauvoir. In 1943 Beauvoir was suspended from her teaching position when she was accused of seducing her 17-year-old lycée pupil Natalie Sorokine in 1939. Sorokines parents laid formal charges against Beauvoir for debauching a minor and Beauvoirs license to teach in France was revoked although it was subsequently reinstated.

In 1977 Beauvoir Sartre Roland Barthes Michel Foucault Jacques Derrida and much of the eras intelligentsia signed a petition seeking to completely remove the age of consent in France.

Beauvoir published her first novel She Came to Stay in 1943. It has been assumed that it is inspired by her and Sartres sexual relationship with Olga Kosakiewicz and Wanda Kosakiewicz. Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where Beauvoir taught during the early 1930s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she rejected him so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda. Upon his death Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years until she met and married Jacques-Laurent Bost a lover of Beauvoir. However the main thrust of the novel is philosophical a scene in which to situate Beauvoirs abiding philosophical pre-occupation - the relationship between the self and the other.

In the novel set just before the outbreak of World War II Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ménage à trois with the young woman. The novel also delves into Beauvoir and Sartres complex relationship and how it was affected by the ménage à trois.

She Came to Stay was followed by many others including The Blood of Others which explores the nature of individual responsibility telling a love story between two young French students participating in the Resistance in World War II.

In 1944 Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay Pyrrhus et Cinéas a discussion on existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay The Ethics of Ambiguity ; it is perhaps the most accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many Sartre included have found in major existentialist works such as Being and Nothingness. In The Ethics of Ambiguity Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.

At the end of World War II Beauvoir and Sartre edited Les Temps modernes a political journal which Sartre founded along with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others. Beauvoir used Les Temps Modernes to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.

The Second Sex first published in 1949 in French as Le Deuxième Sexe turns the existentialist mantra that existence precedes essence into a feminist one One is not born but becomes a woman . With this famous phrase Beauvoir first articulated what has come to be known as the sex-gender distinction that is the distinction between biological sex and the social and historical construction of gender and its attendant stereotypes. Beauvoir argues that the fundamental source of womens oppression is its historical and social construction as the quintessential Other.

Beauvoir defines women as the second sex because women are defined in relation to men. She pointed out that Aristotle argued women are female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities while Thomas Aquinas referred to woman as imperfect man and the incidental being. She quotes In itself homosexuality is as limiting as heterosexuality the ideal should be to be capable of loving a woman or a man; either a human being without feeling fear restraint or obligation.

Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men and thus can choose to elevate themselves moving beyond the immanence to which they were previously resigned and reaching transcendence a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world where one chooses ones freedom.

Chapters of The Second Sex were originally published in Les Temps modernes in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France. It was published soon after in America due to the quick translation by Howard Parshley as prompted by Blanche Knopf wife of publisher Alfred A. Knopf. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language and a minimal understanding of philosophy much of Beauvoirs book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut distorting her intended message. For years Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of Beauvoirs work declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.

Only in 2009 was there a second translation to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010 reinstating a third of the original work.

In the chapter Woman Myth and Reality of The Second Sex Beauvoir argued that men had made women the Other in society by application of a false aura of mystery around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity such as race class and religion but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a patriarchy.

Despite her contributions to the feminist movement especially the French womens liberation movement and her beliefs in womens economic independence and equal education Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist. However after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be enough to bring about womens liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972 in an interview with Le Nouvel Observateur.

In 2018 the manuscript pages of Le Deuxième Sexe were published. At the time her adopted daughter Sylvie Le Bon-Beauvoir a philosophy professor described her mothers writing process Beauvoir wrote every page of her books longhand first and only after that would hire typists.

Published in 1954 The Mandarins won her Frances highest literary prize the Prix Goncourt. The book is set after the end of World War II and follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartres and Beauvoirs intimate circle including her relationship with American writer Nelson Algren to whom the book was dedicated.

Algren was outraged by the frank way Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both The Mandarins and her autobiographies. Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of Beauvoirs work. Much material bearing on this episode in Beauvoirs life including her love letters to Algren entered the public domain only after her death.

Beauvoirs early novel Les Inséparables long suppressed was published in French in 2020 and in two different English translations in 2021. Written in 1954 the book describes her first love a classmate named Elisabeth Lacoin who died before age 22 and had as a teenager a passionate and tragic relationship with Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty then teaching at the same school. Disapproved by Sartre the novel was deemed too intimate to be published during Beauvoirs lifetime.

Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories including The Woman Destroyed which like some of her other later work deals with aging.

Sartre and Merleau-Ponty had a longstanding feud which led Merleau-Ponty to leave Les Temps Modernes. Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In Beauvoirs later years she hosted the journals editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre whom she often had to force

Beauvoir also wrote a four-volume autobiography consisting of Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter; The Prime of Life; Force of Circumstance ; and All Said and Done. In 1964 Beauvoir published a novella-length autobiography A Very Easy Death covering the time she spent visiting her ageing mother who was dying of cancer. The novella brings up questions of ethical concerns with truth-telling in doctor-patient relationships.

Her 1970 long essay La Vieillesse is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.

In the 1970s Beauvoir became active in Frances womens liberation movement. She wrote and signed the Manifesto of the 343 in 1971 a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion then illegal in France. Some as Catherine Deneuve Delphine Seyrig and Beauvoirs sister Poupette. In 1974 abortion was legalised in France.

In a 1975 interview with Betty Friedan Beauvoir said No woman should be authorized to stay at home and raise her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice precisely because if there is such a choice too many women will make that one.

In about 1976 Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the United States to visit Kate Millett on her farm.

In 1981 she wrote La Cérémonie Des Adieux a painful account of Sartres last years. In the opening of Adieux Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.

She contributed the piece Feminism alive well and in constant danger to the 1984 anthology Sisterhood Is Global The International Womens Movement Anthology edited by Robin Morgan.

After Sartre died in 1980 Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After Beauvoirs death Sartres adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartres letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartres letters available today have Beauvoirs edits which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms. Beauvoirs adopted daughter and literary heir Sylvie Le Bon unlike Elkaïm published Beauvoirs unedited letters to both Sartre and Algren.

Beauvoir died of pneumonia on 14 April 1986 in Paris aged 78. She is buried next to Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris. She was honored as a figure at the forefront of the struggle for womens rights around the time of her passing.

Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex is considered a foundational work in the history of feminism. Beauvoir had denied being a feminist multiple times but ultimately admitted that she was one after the influential Second Sex became crucial in the world of feminism. The work has had a profound influence opening the way for second wave feminism in the United States Canada Australia and around the world. Despite the fact that Beauvoir has been quoted as saying There is a certain unreasonable demand that I find a little stupid because it would enclose me immobilize me completely in a sort of feminist concrete block. Her works on feminism have paved the way for all future feminists. Founders of the second wave read The Second Sex in translation including Kate Millett Shulamith Firestone Juliet Mitchell Ann Oakley and Germaine Greer. All acknowledged their profound debt to Beauvoir including visiting her in France consulting with her at crucial moments and dedicating works to her.Betty Friedan whose 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often regarded as the opening salvo of second wave feminism in the United States later said that reading The Second Sex in the early 1950s led me to whatever original analysis of womens existence I have been able to contribute to the Womens movement and to its unique politics. I looked to Simone de Beauvoir for a philosophical and intellectual authority.

At one point in the early seventies Beauvoir also aligned herself with the League for Womans rights as a means to campaign and fight against sexism in the French society. Beauvoirs influence goes beyond just her impact on second wave founders and extends to numerous aspects of feminism including literary criticism history philosophy theology criticism of scientific discourse and psychotherapy. When Beauvoir first became involved with the feminism movement one of her first objectives was that of legalizing abortion.Donna Haraway wrote that despite important differences all the modern feminist meanings of gender have roots in Simone de Beauvoirs claim that one is not born a woman . This most famous feminist sentence ever written is echoed in the title of Monique Wittigs 1981 essay One Is Not Born a Woman.Judith Butler took the concept a step further arguing that Beauvoirs choice of the verb to become suggests that gender is a process constantly being renewed in an ongoing interaction between the surrounding culture and individual choice."
Gustave Belot,"Gustave Belot was a French philosopher and educational administrator.

Gustave Belot was born 7 August 1859 at Strasbourg the son of a professor in the faculty of letters at Lyons. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1878 taking the philosophy agrégation in 1881 and becoming a provincial philosophy instructor at Brest and elsewhere. In 1899 he succeeded Lucien Lévy-Bruhl as professor of philosophy at the lycée Louis-le-Grand. In 1911 he was appointed Inspector of the Paris Academy and in 1913 he became Inspector-General of Secondary Instruction. He died in Paris on 21 December 1929. Informed by Durkheimian sociology he was a theorist of collectively-held lay morality which was rational and based upon general interest.

Gustave Belot is the brother of Émile Belot engineer inventor and astronomer and the great great uncle of Pierre Pincemaille musician and organist."
Julien Benda,"Julien Benda was a French philosopher and novelist known as an essayist and cultural critic. He is best known for his short book La Trahison des Clercs from 1927 .

Born into a Jewish family in Paris Benda had a secular upbringing. He was educated at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. After a period at the École Centrale Paris he turned to history and graduated at the Sorbonne in 1894.

His fathers death in 1889 left Benda independently wealthy. He wrote for La Revue Blanche from 1891 to 1903. His articles on the Dreyfus affair were collected and published as Dialogues. He disagreed strongly with Henri Bergson the leading light of French philosophy of his day and launched an attack on him in 1911 when Bergsons reputation was at its height.

In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers Congress the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain held in Valencia Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including André Malraux Ernest Hemingway Stephen Spender and Pablo Neruda.

Benda survived the German occupation of France and the Vichy regime 19401944 in Carcassonne. The journal of Jean Guéhenno described his life there and his character Unbearable yet likeable. He died in Fontenay-aux-Roses on 7 June 1956.

Benda is considered to be primarily an essayist. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. His single nomination for the Goncourt Prize was in 1912 for LOrdination. He lost out to André Savignons novel Les filles de la pluie. Voting was tied and the casting vote went to Léon Hennique in a notorious election that caused Hennique to give up the presidency of the Académie Goncourt.

Benda is now best remembered for his short 1927 book La Trahison des Clercs a work of considerable influence. It was translated into English in 1928 by Richard Aldington; the U.S. edition was titled The Treason of the Intellectuals while the British edition was titled The Great Betrayal. Aldingtons translation was republished in 2006 as The Treason of the Intellectuals with a new introduction by Roger Kimball. This polemical essay argued that European intellectuals in the 19th and 20th centuries had often lost the ability to reason dispassionately about political and military matters instead becoming apologists for crass nationalism warmongering and racism. Benda reserved his harshest criticisms for his fellow Frenchmen Charles Maurras and Maurice Barrès. Benda defended the measured and dispassionate outlook of classical civilization and the internationalism of traditional Christianity.

Closing this work Benda darkly predicts that the augmentation of the realistic impulse to domination of the material world justified by intellectuals into an integral realism risked producing an all-encompassing species-civilization that would completely cease to situate the good outside the real world. Human aspirations specifically after power would become the sole end of society. In closing he concludes bitterly And History will smile to think that this is the species for which Socrates and Jesus Christ died.

Bendas word clercs was borrowed by Anne Appelbaum in her 2020 book Twilight of Democracy The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.

Other works by Benda include Belphégor Uriels Report and Exercises of a Man Buried Alive an attack on the contemporary French celebrities of his time. Most of the titles in the bibliography below were published during the last three decades of Bendas long life; he is emphatically a 20th-century author."
Alain de Benoist,"Alain de Benoist also known as Fabrice Laroche Robert de Herte David Barney and other pen names is a French journalist and political philosopher a founding member of the Nouvelle Droite and the leader of the ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE.

Principally influenced by thinkers of the German Conservative Revolution de Benoist is opposed to Christianity the rights of man neoliberalism representative democracy egalitarianism; and what he sees as embodying and promoting those values namely the United States. He theorized the notion of ethnopluralism a concept which relies on preserving and mutually respecting individual and bordered ethno-cultural regions.

His work has been influential with the alt-right movement in the United States and he presented a lecture on identity at a National Policy Institute conference hosted by Richard B. Spencer; however he has distanced himself from the movement.

Alain de Benoist was born on 11 December 1943 in Saint-Symphorien Centre-Val de Loire the son of a head of sales at Guerlain also named Alain de Benoist and Germaine de Benoist née Langouët. He grew up in a bourgeois and Catholic family. His mother came from the lower-middle class of Normandy and Brittany and his father belonged to the Belgian nobility. During the Second World War his father was a member of the Resistance armed group French Forces of the Interior. He was a self-declared Gaullist whereas his wife Germaine was rather left-leaning and the extended de Benoist family was divided between Free France and Vichy France during the conflict.

His paternal grandmother Yvonnes de Benoist was the secretary of Gustave Le Bon. De Benoist is also the great-nephew of French Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau.

De Benoist was still in high school at Lycée Montaigne and Louis-le-Grand during the turmoils of the Algerian war a period that shaped his political views. In 1957 he met the daughter of the antisemite journalist and conspiracy theorist Henry Coston. From the age of 15 de Benoist became interested in the nationalist right; he started a career as a journalist in 1960 by writing literary pieces and pamphlets for Costons magazine Lectures Françaises generally in defence of the French colonial empire and the pro-colonial paramilitary organization Organisation Armée Secrète . However de Benoist stayed away from Costons conspiracy theories on the Freemasonry and the Jews.

Aged 17 in 1961 he met François dOrcival with whom he became the editor of France Information an underground pro-OAS newspaper. The same year de Benoist started to attend the University of Paris and joined the far-right student society Federation of Nationalist Students . In 1962 he became the secretary of the groups magazine Cahiers universitaires in which he wrote the main articles along with dOrcival. As a student in law and literature he began a period of political activism and developed a passion for fantastique cinema. According to philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff de Benoist possessed an intellectual curiosity that was lacking among his elder colleagues like Dominique Venner or Jean Mabire and the young journalist led them to discover a conceptual universe that they could not imagine no more than its possible ideological exploitations.

De Benoist met Dominique Venner in 1962. The following year he took part in the creation of Europe-Action a white nationalist magazine founded by Venner and in which de Benoist began to work as a journalist. He published at that times his first essays Salan devant lopinion and Le courage est leur patrie defending French Algeria and the OAS.

Between 1963 and 1965 de Benoist was a member of the Rationalist Union; he probably began to read Louis Rougiers criticism of Christianity during that period. De Benoist met Rougier who was also a member of the organization and his ideas deeply influenced de Benoists own anti-Christianity. We oppose Rougier to Sartre de Benoist wrote in 1965 as we oppose verbal delirium to logics because biological realism is the best support against those idealistic chimeras. De Benoist became in 1964 the editor-in-chief of the weekly publication Europe-Action Hebdomaire renamed LObservateur Européen in October 1966. He also wrote in the neo-fascist magazine Défense de lOccident founded in 1952 by Maurice Bardèche.

After a visit to South Africa at the invitation of Hendrik Verwoerds National Party government de Benoist co-wrote with Gilles Fournier the 1965 essay Vérité pour lAfrique du Sud in which they endorsed apartheid. The following year he co-wrote with DOrcival another essay Rhodésie pays des lions fidèles in defence of Rhodesia a breakaway country in southern Africa ruled at that time by a white-minority government. The then prime minister of the unrecognized state Ian Smith prefaced the book. Returning from a trip to the United States in 1965 de Benoist deplored the suppression of racial segregation and wrote as a prediction that the system would survive outside the law thus in a more violent way.

In two essays published in 1966 Les Indo-Européens and Quest-ce que le nationalisme de Benoist contributed to define a new form of European nationalism in which the European civilization to be understood as the white race would be considered above its constituting ethnic groups all united within a common empire and civilization superseding the nation states. This agenda was adopted by the European Rally for Liberty during the 1967 legislative election and later became a core idea of GRECE since its foundation in 1968.

The successive failures of the far-right movements de Benoist had supported since the early 1960s from the dissolution of OAS and the Évian Accords of 1962 to the electoral defeat of presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in 1965 to the debacle of the REL in the March 1967 election led de Benoist to question his political involvement. In the fall of 1967 he decided to make a permanent and complete break with political action and to focus on a meta-political strategy by launching a review. During the May 1968 events then aged 25 de Benoist worked as a journalist for the professional magazine LÉcho de la presse et de la publicité.

The Groupement de Recherche et dÉtudes pour la Civilisation Européenne was founded in January 1968 in order to serve as a meta-political ethnonationalist think-tank promoting the ideas of the Nouvelle Droite. Although the organization was established with former militants of the REL and FEN de Benoist has been described by scholars as its leader and most authoritative spokesman. In the 1970s de Benoist adapted his geopolitical view-points and went from a pro-colonial attitude towards an advocacy of Third-Worldism against capitalist America and communist Russia from the defence of the last outposts of the West towards anti-Americanism and from a biological to a cultural approach of the notion of alterity an idea which he developed in his ethnopluralist theories.

De Benoists works along with others published by the think tank began to attract public attention in the late 1970s when the media coined the term Nouvelle Droite to label the movement. He started to write articles for mainstream right-wing magazines namely Valeurs Actuelles and Le Spectacle du Monde from 1970 to 1982 and Le Figaro Dimanche from 1977 to 1982 he then wrote for the videos section of the Figaro Magazine until 1992. De Benoist was awarded in 1978 the prestigious Prix de lessai by the Académie française for his book View for the Right . Between 1980 and 1992 he was a regular participant in the radio program Panorama on France Culture.

Although de Benoist had announced his retirement from political parties and elections to focus on meta-politics in 1968 he ran as a candidate for the far-right Party of New Forces during the 1979 European elections. In the 1984 election to the European Parliament de Benoist announced his intention to vote for the French Communist Party and justified his choice by describing the party as the most credible anti-capitalist anti-liberal and anti-American political force then active in France.

De Benoist met Russian writer Alexandr Dugin in 1989 and the two of them soon became close collaborators. De Benoist was invited in Moscow by Dugin in 1992 and Dugin presented himself as the Moscow correspondent of GRECE for a time. The two authors eventually broke off their relationship in 1993 after a virulent campaign in French and German media against the red and brown threat in Russia. Whereas de Benoist acknowledged ideological differences with Dugin especially on Eurasianism and Heidegger they have maintained regular exchanges since then.

In 1979 and 1993 two press campaigns launched in French liberal media against de Benoist damaged his public reputation and influence in France by claiming that he was in reality a closet Fascist or a Nazi. The journalists accused de Benoist of hiding his racist and anti-egalitarian beliefs in a seemingly acceptable public agenda replacing the doomed hierarchy of races with the less suspicious concept of ethno-pluralism. Although he still frequently comments on politics de Benoist chose in the early 1990s to focus on his intellectual activity and to avoid media attention.

In a 2002 in a republication of his book View from the Right de Benoist reiterated what he wrote in 1977 the greatest danger in the world at that time was the progressive disappearance of diversity from the world including biodiversity of animals cultures and peoples. De Benoist is now the editor of two magazines the yearly Nouvelle École and the quarterly Krisis .

Although the extent of the relationship is debated by scholars de Benoist and the Nouvelle Droite are generally viewed as influential on the ideological and political structure of the Identitarian Movement. Part of the alt-right has also claimed to have been inspired by de Benoists writings.

In his early writings de Benoist was close to pro-colonial movements and followed an ethno-biological approach of social science endorsing apartheid as the last outpost of the West at a time of decolonization and international negrification. From the 1970s onward he has gradually moved towards the defence of the Third-World against American imperialism and has adopted a cultural definition of difference theorized in his concept of ethnopluralism. Scholars have questioned whether this evolution should be regarded as a sincere ideological detachment from a far-right activist youth or rather as a meta-political strategy set up to disguise non-egalitarian ideas behind more acceptable concepts. De Benoist is also an ardent critic of globalization unrestricted mass immigration liberalism postmodern society and what he calls the ideology of sameness.

Political scientist Jean-Yves Camus describes the key idea of de Benoist in those terms through the use of meta-politics to think the ways and means that are necessary in order for European civilization based on the cultural values shared on the continent until the advent of globalization to thrive and be perpetuated. Although de Benoist embodies the core values of GRECE and the Nouvelle Droite his works are not always identical to those of other thinkers of the movements. He is opposed in particular to political violence and he has declared that he had been building a school of thought not a political movement. In 2000 he disavowed Guillaume Fayes strongly racist ideas regarding Muslims after the publication of The Colonization of Europe Speaking Truth about Immigration and Islam.

In 2006 de Benoist defined identity as a dialogical phenomenon inspired by Martin Bubers philosophy of dialogue and Ich und Du concept. According to him ones identity is made of two components the objective part coming from ones background and the subjective part freely chosen by the individual. Identity is therefore a perpetual evolution rather than a definitive notion. In 1992 de Benoist dismissed the Front Nationals use of ethnopluralism on the grounds that it portrayed difference as an absolute whereas by definition it exists only relationally. In 1966 however he had written Race is the only real unit encompassing individual variations. The objective study of history shows that only the European race has continued to progress since its appearance on the rising path of the evolution of the living unlike races stagnant in their development therefore in virtual regression.

If scholars like Pierre-André Taguieff have characterized the Nouvelle Droite as a form of mixophobia due to its focus on the notion of difference de Benoist has also criticized what he calls the pathology of identity that is to say the political use of identity by the populist Right in order to push an us versus them debate escorted by Racial factors being statistically hereditary each race has its own psychology. All psychology generates value. Suspicions have thus arisen of a subtle meta-political strategy set up to disguise fascism and racism around an acceptable framework. De Benoist has been influenced by Carl Schmitts distinction between friend and enemy as the core issue of politics. However he sees immigrants as eventually victims of globalization and has argued that immigration was first of all a consequence of multinational companies being greedy for profits and preferring to import cheap labor.

De Benoist rejects the nation state and nationalism on the grounds that both liberalism and nationalism eventually derive from the same metaphysics of subjectivity and that the centralized and Jacobin state French Republic had destroyed regional identities in the project of one and indivisible France. He stands instead for the political autonomy of each and every group favouring an integral federalism built on the principle of subsidiarity that would transcend the nation state and give way for both regional and Europe identities to thrive. De Benoist believes that knowledge of ethnic and religious traditions is a duty which must be passed on to following generations and he has been critical of the idea of a moral imperative to cosmopolitanism.

De Benoist is a critic of the primacy of individual rights an ideology that he sees embodied in humanism the French Revolution and the Founding Fathers of the United States. While not a communist de Benoist has been influenced by the Marxist analysis of the nature of capitalism and conflicting class interests developed by Karl Marx in Das Kapital. As a result another of his core ideas is that the world is facing the hegemony of capital and the pursuit of self-interest two typical trends of the postmodern era.

According to Jean-Yves Camus if de Benoist can share anti-capitalist analysis with leftists the nature of his goal is indeed different since de Benoist considers the unlimited expansion of the free market and consumerism as key contributors to the erasure of peoples identities. Furthermore de Benoist acknowledges the existence of the working class and the bourgeoise but does not make an essential distinction between the two of them. He rather divides society between the new dominant class and the people. In 1991 the editorial staff of his magazine Eléments described the danger of adopting a systematic anti-egalitarianism lead to social Darwinism which might justify free-market economy.

De Benoist is opposed to the American modern liberal idea of a melting pot. A critic of the United States he has been quoted as saying Some people do not accept the thought of one day having to wear the Red Army cap. In fact it is a terrible prospect. However this is not a reason to tolerate the idea of one day having to spend what we have left to live on by eating hamburgers in Brooklyn. In 1991 he described European supporters of the first Gulf War as collaborators of the American order.

De Benoist has supported ties with Islamic culture in the 1980s on the grounds that the relationship would be distinct from what he saw as the consumerism and materialism of the American society and from the bureaucracy and repression of the Soviet Union alike. He also opposes Christianity as inherently intolerant theocratic and bent on persecution.

De Benoists influences include Antonio Gramsci Ernst Jünger Martin Buber Jean Baudrillard Georges Dumézil Ernest Renan José Ortega y Gasset Vilfredo Pareto Karl Marx Guy Debord Arnold Gehlen Stéphane Lupasco Helmut Schelsky Konrad Lorenz the Conservative Revolutionaries including Carl Schmitt and Oswald Spengler the non-conformists of the 1930s Johann Gottfried Herder Johannes Althusius interwar Austro-Marxists and communitarian philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor.

Critics of de Benoist like Thomas Sheehan argue he has developed a novel restatement of fascism.Roger Griffin using an ideal type definition of fascism which includes populist ultra-nationalism and palingenesis argues that the Nouvelle Droite draws on such fascist ideologues as Armin Mohler in a way that allows Nouvelle Droite ideologues such as de Benoist to claim a metapolitical stance but which nonetheless has residual fascist ideological elements. De Benoists critics also claim his views recall Nazi attempts to replace German Christianity with its own paganism. They note that de Benoists rejection of the French Revolutions legacy and the allegedly abstract Rights of Man ties him to the same Counter-Enlightenment right-wing tradition as counter-revolutionary Legitimists fascists Vichyites and integral nationalists.

A neo-pagan de Benoist married Doris Christians a German citizen on 21 June 1972. They have two children. He is a member of the high IQ society Mensa whose former president of the French branch was a member of the patronage committee of Nouvelle École. De Benoist owns the largest private library in France with an estimate of 150000 to 250000 books."
Daniel Bensaïd,"Daniel Bensaïd was a philosopher and a leader of the Trotskyist movement in France. He became a leading figure in the student revolt of 1968 while studying at the University of Paris X Nanterre.

Bensaïd was born in Toulouse France to a father who was a Sephardic Jew from Algeria and who had moved from Oran where he met Bensaïds mother to Vichy Toulouse. In response to the 8 February 1962 Charonne massacre of Algerians in Paris Bensaïd joined the Union of Communist Students. Irritated by the party orthodoxy he swiftly became part of a left opposition within the union and was among the dissidents expelled from the party in 1966.

In 1966 Bensaïd began studying at the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud where he helped found the Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire which became the Ligue Communiste Révolutionnaire . With Daniel Cohn-Bendit he helped to found the Mouvement du 22 Mars which was involved in the protests of May 1968 in France.

Bensaïd became a leading theorist of the LCR and the United Secretariat of the Fourth International and a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris-VIII. He was also a Fellow at the International Institute for Research and Education. Upon his death Tariq Ali described him as Frances leading Marxist public intellectual much in demand on talkshows and writing essays and reviews in Le Monde and Libération. Bensaïd was known for his studies of Walter Benjamin and Karl Marx and a recent analysis of French postmodernism.

He died of cancer arising from the side effects of drugs used to treat AIDS which he had had for the previous 16 years.

Bensaïd and the current of Trotskyism represented by the Unified Secretariat of the Fourth International have come under attack from more orthodox Trotskyists for the strategy they have advanced of entering the new social movements; in particular for seeing reform and revolution as a false dichotomy and proposing the formation of broad parties rather than forming parties of the traditional Leninist type. In one such critique Luke Cooper criticised Bensaïd for arguing thatin certain specific circumstancesit maybe permissible to enter a capitalist government and seek to use the existing state as an instrument of revolutionary transformation. Bensaïd also debated revolutionary strategy with other Fourth International members and the British Socialist Workers Partys International Secretary Alex Callinicos."
Nikolai Berdyaev,"Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev was a Russian philosopher theologian and Christian existentialist who emphasized the existential spiritual significance of human freedom and the human person. Alternative historical spellings of his surname in English include Berdiaev and Berdiaeff and of his given name Nicolas and Nicholas.

Nikolai Berdyaev was born at ObukhovoKiev Governorate in 1874 in an aristocratic military family. His father Alexander Mikhailovich Berdyaev came from a long line of nobility. Almost all of Alexander Mikhailovichs ancestors served as high-ranking military officers but he resigned from the army quite early and became active in the social life of the aristocracy. Nikolais mother Alina Sergeevna Berdyaeva was half-French and came from the top levels of both French and Russian nobility. He also had Polish and Tatar origins.

Greatly influenced by Voltaire his father was an educated man who considered himself a freethinker and expressed great skepticism towards religion. Nikolais mother on the other hand was a practicing Eastern Orthodox Christian. He spent a solitary childhood at home where his fathers library allowed him to read widely. He read Hegel Schopenhauer and Kant when he was only 14 and excelled at languages.

Berdyaev decided on an intellectual career and entered the Kiev University in 1894. It was a time of revolutionary fervor among the students and the intelligentsia. He became a Marxist and he was arrested in a student demonstration and expelled from the university. His involvement in illegal activities led in 1897 to three years of internal exile to Vologda in northern Russia a milder sentence than that faced by many other revolutionaries.

In 1904 he married Lydia Yudifovna Trusheff. The couple moved to Saint Petersburg the Russian capital and the centre of intellectual and revolutionary activity. He participated fully in intellectual and spiritual debate eventually departing from radical Marxism to focus his attention on philosophy and Christian spirituality.

A fiery 1913 article entitled Quenchers of the Spirit criticising the rough purging of Imiaslavie Russian monks on Mount Athos by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church using tsarist troops caused him to be charged with the crime of blasphemy the punishment for which was exile to Siberia for life. The World War and the Bolshevik Revolution prevented the matter coming to trial. After the October Revolution of 1917 as the Bolshevik régime began consolidating its power with a growing suppression of non-Lenin Marxist Intelligentsia Berdyaev remained steadfast in his criticism of its totalitarianism and the domination of the state over the freedom of the individual. Nonetheless he was permitted for the time being to continue to lecture and write.

His disaffection culminated in 1919 with the foundation of his own private academy the Free Academy of Spiritual Culture. It was primarily a forum for him to lecture on the hot topics of the day and to present them from a Christian point of view. He also presented his opinions in public lectures and every Tuesday the academy hosted a meeting at his home because official Soviet anti-religious activity was intense at the time and the official policy of the Bolshevik government with its Soviet anti-religious legislation strongly promoted State atheism.

In 1920 Berdiaev became professor of philosophy at the University of Moscow. In the same year he was accused of participating in a conspiracy against the government; he was arrested and jailed. The feared head of the Cheka Felix Dzerzhinsky came in person to interrogate him and he gave his interrogator a solid dressing down on the problems with Bolshevism. Novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his book The Gulag Archipelago recounts the incident as follows

The Soviet authorities eventually expelled Berdyaev from Russia in September 1922. He became one of a group of prominent writers scholars and intellectuals who were sent into forced exile on the so-called philosophers ships.

At first Berdyaev and other émigrés went to Berlin where he founded an academy of philosophy and religion but economic and political conditions in the Weimar Republic caused him and his wife to move to Paris in 1923. He transferred his academy there and taught lectured and wrote working for an exchange of ideas with the French and European intellectual community and participated in a number of international conferences.

During the German occupation of France during World War II Berdyaev continued to write books that were published after the war some of them after his death. In the years that he spent in France Berdyaev wrote 15 books including most of his most important works. He died at his writing desk in his home in Clamart near Paris in 1948.

Primary source biographical works in English are Berdyaevs intellectual autobiography published originally under the title Dream and Reality and Donald A. Lowries 1960 book Rebellious Prophet A Life of Nikolai Berdyaev written in close collaboration with Berdyaevs sister-in-law Evgenia Rapp and others of their close acquaintance under the auspices of the Berdiaev Société.

According to Marko Markovic Berdyaev was an ardent man rebellious to all authority an independent and negative spirit. He could assert himself only in negation and could not hear any assertion without immediately negating it to such an extent that he would even be able to contradict himself and to attack people who shared his own prior opinions. According to Marina Makienko Anna Panamaryova and Andrey Gurban Berdyaevs works are emotional controversial bombastic affective and dogmatic. They summarise that according to Berdyaev man unites two worlds the world of the divine and the natural world. ... Through the freedom and creativity the two natures must unite... To overcome the dualism of existence is possible only through creativity.

David Bonner Richardson described Berdyaevs philosophy as Christian existentialism and personalism.

One of the central themes of Berdyaevs work was philosophy of love. At first he systematically developed his theory of love in a special article published in the journal Pereval in 1907. Then he gave gender issues a notable place in his book The Meaning of the Creative Act . According to him 1 erotic energy is an eternal source of creativity 2 eroticism is linked to beauty and eros means search for the beautiful.

He also published works about Russian history and the Russian national character. In particular he wrote about Russian nationalism

The Russian people did not achieve their ancient dream of Moscow the Third Rome. The ecclesiastical schism of the seventeenth century revealed that the muscovite tsardom is not the third Rome. The messianic idea of the Russian people assumed either an apocalyptic form or a revolutionary; and then there occurred an amazing event in the destiny of the Russian people. Instead of the Third Rome in Russia the Third International was achieved and many of the features of the Third Rome pass over to the Third International. The Third International is also a Holy Empire and it also is founded on an Orthodox faith. The Third International is not international but a Russian national idea.

Berdyaev was a member of the Russian Orthodox Churchpp. 111112p. 8 and believed Orthodoxy was the religious tradition closest to early Christianity.at unk.

Nicholas Berdyaev was an Orthodox however it must be said that he was an independent and somewhat a liberal kind. Berdyaev also criticized the Russian Orthodox Church and described his views as anticlerical but this should be considered in the context of an abusive distortion of the we aspect of churchly Sobornost by a pseudo us-them class divisive Marxist-like mentality. Yet he considered himself closer to Orthodoxy than either Catholicism or Protestantism. According to him I can not call myself a typical Orthodox of any kind; but Orthodoxy was near to me than either Catholicism or Protestantism. I never severed my link with the Orthodox Church although confessional self-satisfaction and exclusiveness are alien to me.For that reason Berdyaev belonged to the twentieth century and possibly to the present. 

Berdyaev is frequently presented as one of the important Russian Orthodox thinkers of the 20th century. However neopatristic scholars such as Florovsky have questioned whether his philosophy is essentially Orthodox in character and emphasize his western influences. But Florovsky can hardly be considered an objective unbiased critic having been savaged in a 1937 Journal Put article by Berdyaev along with Florovskys own extreme ultra-Byzantine views impelling his 1955 career change. Paul Valliere has pointed out the sociological factors and global trends which have shaped the Neopatristic movement and questions their claim that Berdyaev and Vladimir Solovyov are somehow less authentically Orthodox.

Berdyaev affirmed universal salvation as did many important Orthodox theologians of the 20th century. Along with Sergei Bulgakov he was instrumental in bringing renewed attention to the Orthodox doctrine of apokatastasis which had largely been neglected since it was expounded by Maximus the Confessor in the seventh century although he rejected Origens articulation of this doctrine.

The aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War along with Soviet interference caused the Russian Orthodox emigre diaspora to splinter into three Russian Church jurisdictions the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia ; the parishes under Metropolitan Eulogius that went under the Constantinople Ecumenical Patriarchate; and parishes that remained under the Moscow Patriarchate. Berdyaev was among those that chose to remain under the omophor of the Moscow Patriarchate. He is mentioned by name on the KorsunChersonese Diocesan history as among those noted figures who supported the Moscow Patriarchate West-European Eparchy .

Currently the house in Clamart in which Berdyaev lived now comprises a small Berdiaev-museum and attached Chapel in name of the Holy Spirit under the omophor of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 24 March 2018 the 70th anniversary of Berdyaevs death the priest of the Chapel served panikhida-memorial prayer at the Diocesan cathedral for eternal memory of Berdyaev and later that day the Diocesan bishop Nestor presided over prayer at the grave of Berdyaev.

In 1901 Berdyaev opened his literary career so to speak by work on Subjectivism and Individualism in Social Philosophy. In it he analyzed a movement then beginning in Imperial Russia that at the beginning of the twentieth-century Russian Marxism split up; the more cultured Russian Marxists went through a spiritual crisis and became founders of an idealist and religious movement while the majority began to prepare the advent of Communism. He wrote over twenty books and dozens of articles.

Gaston Berger,"Gaston Berger was a French futurist but also an industrialist a philosopher and a state manager. He is mainly known for his remarkably lucid analysis of Edmund Husserls phenomenology and for his studies on the character structure.

Berger was born in Saint-Louis Senegal French West Africa . He received his primary and part of his secondary education in Perpignan France and had to take up a position in an industrial firm. After having performed his military duties in World War I he became an associate of the owner of the firm. Berger decided to continue his studies. He worked with Rene Le Senne and passed his baccalaureat. He then enrolled in the University of Aix-en-Provence where he studied philosophy under Maurice Blondel. Having passed his licence he obtained a diploma dEtudes Superieures with a thesis on the Relations between the conditions of intelligibility on the one hand and the problem of contingency on the other hand. In 1926 Berger founded with some friends the Societe de Philosophie du Sud-est and its periodical Les Études philosophiques. In 1938 he organized the first Congress of French Language Societies of Philosophy. In 1941 he submitted his two theses de doctorat dEtat the first entitled Investigations on the conditions of Knowledge. Essay of Pure Knowledge the second The Cogito in Husserls philosophy. Berger then left his industrial firm and became first a Chargé de Cours then a Maitre de Conferences for philosophy at the University of Aix-en Provence. In 1944 he became full professor. In 1949 he became secretary general of the Fulbright Commission in charge of the cultural relations between France and the United States.

After managing a fertilizer plant during the 1930s he created in Paris the Centre Universitaire International et des Centres de Prospective and directed the philosophical studies . The term prospective invented by Gaston Berger is the study of the possible futures.

From 1953 to 1960 he was in charge of the tertiary education at the Minister of National Education and modernised the French universities system. He was elected at the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1955.

In 1957 he founded the journal Prospective and the homonym centre with André Gros. This same year he created the Institut national des sciences appliquées of Lyon with the rector Capelle.

He was the father of the French choreographer Maurice Béjart a stage name for Maurice-Jean Berger. The university of Saint-Louis Senegal where he was born is named after him."
Henri Bergson,"Henri-Louis Bergson was a French philosopher who was influential in the tradition of continental philosophy especially during the first half of the 20th century until the Second World War. Bergson is known for his arguments that processes of immediate experience and intuition are more significant than abstract rationalism and science for understanding reality.

He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented. In 1930 France awarded him its highest honour the Grand-Croix de la Legion dhonneur.

Bergsons great popularity created a controversy in France where his views were seen as opposing the secular and scientific attitude adopted by the Republics officials.

Bergson lived the quiet life of a French professor marked by the publication of his four principal works

In 1900 the Collège de France selected Bergson to a Chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy which he held until 1904. He then replaced Gabriel Tarde in the Chair of Modern Philosophy which he held until 1920. The public attended his open courses in large numbers.

Bergson was born in the Rue Lamartine in Paris not far from the Palais Garnier in 1859. His father the composer and pianist Michał Bergson was of Polish-Jewish background . His great-grandmother Temerl Bergson was a well-known patroness and benefactor of Polish Jewry especially those associated with the Hasidic movement. His mother Katherine Levison daughter of a Yorkshire doctor was from an English-Jewish and Irish-Jewish background. The Bereksohns were a famous Jewish entrepreneurial family of Polish descent. Henri Bergsons great-great-grandfather Szmul Jakubowicz Sonnenberg called Zbytkower was a prominent banker and a protégé of Stanisław II AugustusKing of Poland from 1764 to 1795.

Henri Bergsons family lived in London for a few years after his birth and he obtained an early familiarity with the English language from his mother. Before he was nine his parents settled in France Henri becoming a naturalized French citizen.

Henri Bergson married Louise Neuberger a cousin of Marcel Proust in 1891. Henri and Louise Bergson had a daughter Jeanne born deaf in 1896. Bergsons sister Mina Bergson married the English occult author Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers a founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the couple later relocated to Paris as well.

Bergson attended the Lycée Fontanes in Paris from 1868 to 1878. He had previously received a Jewish religious education. Between 14 and 16 however he lost his faith. According to Hude this moral crisis is tied to his discovery of the theory of evolution according to which humanity shares common ancestry with modern primates a process sometimes construed as not needing a creative deity.

While at the lycée Bergson won a prize for his scientific work and another in 1877 when he was eighteen for the solution of a mathematical problem. His solution was published the following year in Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques. It was his first published work. After some hesitation as to whether his career should lie in the sphere of the sciences or that of the humanities he decided in favour of the latter to the dismay of his teachers. When he was nineteen he entered the École Normale Supérieure. During this period he read Herbert Spencer. He obtained there the degree of licence ès lettres and this was followed by that of agrégation de philosophie in 1881 from the University of Paris.

The same year he received a teaching appointment at the lycée in Angers the ancient capital of Anjou. Two years later he settled at the Lycée Blaise-Pascal in Clermont-Ferrand capital of the Puy-de-Dôme département.

The year after his arrival at Clermont-Ferrand Bergson displayed his ability in the humanities by the publication of an edition of extracts from Lucretius with a critical study of De Rerum Natura issued as Extraits de Lucrèce and of the materialist cosmology of the poet . Repeated editions of which attest to its value in promoting Classics among French youth. While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country Bergson found time for private study and original work. He crafted his dissertation Time and Free Will which was submitted along with a short Latin thesis on Aristotle for his doctoral degree which was awarded by the University of Paris in 1889. The work was published in the same year by Félix Alcan. He also gave courses in Clermont-Ferrand on the Pre-Socratics in particular on Heraclitus.

Bergson dedicated Time and Free Will to Jules Lachelier then public education minister a disciple of Félix Ravaisson and the author of a philosophical work On the Founding of Induction . Lachelier endeavoured to substitute everywhere force for inertia life for death and liberty for fatalism. 

Bergson settled again in Paris in 1888 and after teaching for some months at the municipal college known as the College Rollin he received an appointment at the Lycée Henri-Quatre where he remained for eight years. There he read Darwin and gave a course on his theories. Although Bergson had previously endorsed Lamarckism and its theory of the heritability of acquired characteristics he came to prefer Darwins hypothesis of gradual variations which were more compatible with his continual vision of life.

In 1896 he published his second major work entitled Matter and Memory. This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of perception and memory leading up to a careful consideration of the problems of the relation of body and mind. Bergson had spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works. This is especially obvious in Matter and Memory where he showed a thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations which had been carried out during the period.

In 1898 Bergson became maître de conférences at his alma mater École Normale Supérieure and later in the same year received a promotion to a Professorship. The year 1900 saw him installed as Professor at the Collège de France where he accepted the Chair of Greek and Roman Philosophy in succession to Charles Lévêque.

At the first International Congress of Philosophy held in Paris during the first five days of August 1900 Bergson read a short but important paper Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality . In 1900 Felix Alcan published a work which had previously appeared in the Revue de Paris entitled Laughter one of the most important of Bergsons minor productions. This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in the Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergsons views of life and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable. The main thesis of the work is that laughter is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. We laugh at people who fail to adapt to the demands of society if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism. Comic authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in there being something mechanical encrusted on the living.

In 1901 the Académie des sciences morales et politiques elected Bergson as a member and he became a member of the institute. In 1903 he contributed to the Revue de métaphysique et de morale a very important essay entitled Introduction to Metaphysics which is useful as a preface to the study of his three large books. He detailed in this essay his philosophical program realized in the Creative Evolution.

On the death of Gabriel Tarde the sociologist and philosopher in 1904 Bergson succeeded him in the Chair of Modern Philosophy. From 4 to 8 September of that year he visited Geneva attending the Second International Congress of Philosophy when he lectured on The Mind and Thought A Philosophical Illusion . An illness prevented his visiting Germany from attending the Third Congress held at Heidelberg. In these years Bergson strongly influenced a young Jacques Maritain perhaps even saving Maritain and his wife Raïssa from thoughts of suicide.

His third major work Creative Evolution the most widely known and most discussed of his books appeared in 1907. Pierre Imbart de la Tour remarked that Creative Evolution was a milestone of new direction in thought. By 1918 Alcan the publisher had issued twenty-one editions making an average of two editions per annum for ten years. Following the appearance of this book Bergsons popularity increased enormously not only in academic circles but among the general reading public.

At that time Bergson had already made an extensive study of biology including the theory of fecundation which had only recently emerged ca. 1885 no small feat for a philosopher specializing in the history of philosophy in particular Greek and Roman philosophy. He also most certainly had read apart from Darwin Haeckel from whom he retained his idea of a unity of life and of the ecological solidarity between all living beings as well as Hugo de Vries from whom he quoted his mutation theory of evolution . He also quoted Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard the successor of Claude Bernard at the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Collège de France etc.

Bergson served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters sculptors decorators engravers writers and musicians.

Bergson traveled to London in 1908 and met there with William James the Harvard philosopher who was Bergsons senior by seventeen years and who was instrumental in calling the attention of the Anglo-American public to the work of the French professor. The two became great friends. Jamess impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under date of 4 October 1908

So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus will end by prevailing and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy.

As early as 1880 James had contributed an article in French to the periodical La Critique philosophique of Renouvier and Pillon entitled Le Sentiment de lEffort. Four years later a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal Mind What is an Emotion and On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology. Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work Time and Free Will. In the following years 189091 appeared the two volumes of Jamess monumental work The Principles of Psychology in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson. Some writers taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking the fact that Jamess investigations had been proceeding since 1870 have mistakenly dated Bergsons ideas as earlier than Jamess.

William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903 he wrote

I have been re-reading Bergsons books and nothing that I have read for years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that his philosophy has a great future; it breaks through old frameworks and brings things to a solution from which new crystallizations can be reached.

The most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the Hibbert Lectures which James gave at Manchester College Oxford shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he gained from Bergsons thought and refers to his confidence in being able to lean on Bergsons authority. 

The influence of Bergson had led James to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that logic is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be. It had induced him he continued to give up logic squarely and irrevocably as a method for he found that reality life experience concreteness immediacy use what word you will exceeds our logic overflows and surrounds it.

These remarks which appeared in Jamess book A Pluralistic Universe in 1909 impelled many English and American readers to investigate Bergsons philosophy for themselves but no English translations of Bergsons major work had yet appeared. James however encouraged and assisted Arthur Mitchell in preparing an English translation of Creative Evolution. In August 1910 James died. It was his intention had he lived to see the translation finished to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence in that same year Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled Truth and Reality for the French translation of Jamess book Pragmatism. In it he expressed sympathetic appreciation of Jamess work together with certain important reservations.

From 5 to 11 April Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at Bologna in Italy where he gave an address on Philosophical Intuition. In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received. His speeches offered new Perspectives and elucidated many passages in his three major works Time and Free Will Matter and Memory and Creative Evolution. Although necessarily brief statements they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.

In May 1911 Bergson gave two lectures entitled The Perception of Change at the University of Oxford. The Clarendon Press published these in French in the same year.His talks were concise and lucid leading students and the general reader to his other longer writings. Oxford later conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Science.

Two days later he delivered the Huxley Lecture at the University of Birmingham taking for his subject Life and Consciousness. This subsequently appeared in The Hibbert Journal and since revised is the first essay in the collected volume Mind-Energy . In October he again traveled to England where he had an enthusiastic reception and delivered at University College London four lectures on La Nature de lÂme .

In 1913 Bergson visited the United States of America at the invitation of Columbia University New York and lectured in several American cities where very large audiences welcomed him. In February at Columbia University he lectured both in French and English taking as his subjects Spirituality and Freedom and The Method of Philosophy. Being again in England in May of the same year he accepted the Presidency of the British Society for Psychical Research and delivered to the Society an address on Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research .

Meanwhile his popularity increased and translations of his works began to appear in a number of languages English German Italian Danish Swedish Hungarian Polish and Russian. In 1914 Bergsons fellow-countrymen honoured him by his election as a member of the Académie française. He was also made President of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques and in addition he became Officier de la Légion dhonneur and Officier de lInstruction publique.

Bergson found disciples of many types. In France movements such as neo-Catholicism and Modernism on the one hand and syndicalism on the other endeavoured to absorb and appropriate for their own ends some central ideas of his teaching. The continental organ of socialist and syndicalist theory Le Mouvement socialisteportrayed the realism of Karl Marx and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as hostile to all forms of intellectualism and argued therefore that supporters of Marxist socialism should welcome a philosophy such as that of Bergson. Other writers in their eagerness claimed that the thought of the holder of the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France and the aims of the Confédération Générale du Travail and the Industrial Workers of the World were in essential agreement.

While social revolutionaries endeavoured to make the most out of Bergson many religious leaders particularly the more liberal-minded theologians of all creeds e.g. the Modernists and Neo-Catholic Party in his own country showed a keen interest in his writings and many of them found encouragement and stimulus in his work. The Roman Catholic Church however banned Bergsons three books on the charge of pantheism . They were placed on the Index of prohibited books .

In 1914 the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous Gifford Lectures planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course consisting of eleven lectures under the title of The Problem of Personality at the University of Edinburgh in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war. 

Bergson was not however silent during the conflict and he gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914 he wrote an article entitled Wearing and Nonwearing forces which appeared in a periodical of the poilus Le Bulletin des Armées de la République Française. A presidential address The Meaning of the War was delivered in December 1914 to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

Bergson contributed also to the publication arranged by The Daily Telegraph in honour of King Albert I of the Belgians King Alberts Book .In 1915 he was succeeded in the office of President of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques by Alexandre Ribot and then delivered a discourse on The Evolution of German Imperialism. Meanwhile he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of traveling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated in the negotiations which led to the entry of the United States in the war. He was there when the French Mission under René Viviani paid a visit in April and May 1917 following upon Americas entry into the conflict. Vivianis book La Mission française en Amérique contains a preface by Bergson.

Early in 1918 the Académie française received Bergson officially when he took his seat among The Select Forty as successor to Emile Ollivier . A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows us the central idea of his own philosophy in action. To no other philosopher has it fallen during his lifetime to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested.

As many of Bergsons contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible he had them published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title Spiritual Energy Essays and Lectures . The advocate of Bergsons philosophy in England Wildon Carr prepared an English translation under the title Mind-Energy. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911 Life and Consciousness in a revised and developed form under the title Consciousness and Life. Signs of Bergsons growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included as is also the one given in France LÂme et le Corps which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergsons famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904 The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism which now appears as Le cerveau et la pensée une illusion philosophique. Other articles are on the False Recognition on Dreams and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force and on his view of tension and detension as applied to the relation of matter and mind.

In June 1920 the University of Cambridge honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Letters. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics religion and sociology the Collège de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair but no longer delivered lectures his place being taken by his disciple the mathematician and philosopher Édouard Le Roy who supported a conventionalist stance on the foundations of mathematics which was adopted by Bergson. Le Roy who also succeeded to Bergson at the Académie française and was a fervent Catholic extended to revealed truth his conventionalism leading him to privilege faith heart and sentiment to dogmas speculative theology and abstract reasoning. Like Bergsons his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican.

In 1922 Bergsons book Durée et simultanéité a propos de la theorie dEinstein was published. Earlier that year Albert Einstein had come to the French Society of Philosophy and briefly replied to a short speech made by Bergson. It has been alleged that Bergsons knowledge of physics was insufficient and that the book did not follow up contemporary developments on physics. On the contrary in Einstein and the Crisis of Reason a leading French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty accused Einstein of failing to grasp Bergsons argument. This argument Merleau-Ponty says which concerns not the physics of special relativity but its philosophical foundations addresses paradoxes caused by popular interpretations and misconceptions about the theory including Einsteins own.Duration and simultaneity was not published in the 1951 Edition du Centenaire in French which contained all of his other works and was only published later in a work gathering different essays titled Mélanges. This work took advantage of Bergsons experience at the League of Nations where he presided from 1920 to 1925 over the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation .

While living with his wife and daughter in a modest house in a quiet street near the Porte dAuteuil in Paris Bergson won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927 for having written The Creative Evolution. Because of serious rheumatics ailments he could not travel to Stockholm and sent instead a text subsequently published in La Pensée et le mouvant. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928.

After his retirement from the Collège de France Bergson began to fade into obscurity he suffered from a degenerative illness . He completed his new work The Two Sources of Morality and Religion which extended his philosophical theories to the realms of morality religion and art in 1932. It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community but all by that time realized that Bergsons days as a philosophical luminary were past. He was however able to reiterate his core beliefs near the end of his life by renouncing all of the posts and honours previously awarded him rather than accept exemption from the antisemitic laws imposed by the Vichy government.

Bergson inclined to convert to Catholicism writing in his will on 7 February 1937 My thinking has always brought me nearer to Catholicism in which I saw the perfect complement to Judaism. Though wishing to convert to Catholicism as stated in his will he did not convert in view of the travails inflicted on the Jewish people by the rise of Nazism and anti-Semitism in Europe in the 1930s; he did not want to appear to want to leave the persecuted. After the fall of France in 1940 Jews in occupied France were required to register at police stations. When completing his police form Bergson made the following entry Academic. Philosopher. Nobel Prize winner. Jew. It was the position of the Archbishop of Paris Emmanuel Célestin Suhard that the public revelation of Bergsons conversion was too dangerous at the time when the city was occupied by the Nazis to both the Church and the Jewish population.

On 3 January 1941 Bergson died in occupied Paris from bronchitis. A Roman Catholic priest said prayers at his funeral per his request. Bergson is buried in the Cimetière de Garches Hauts-de-Seine.

Bergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality . He argued that we must allow space for free will to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion. While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time space and causality in his concept of Duration making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality. Seeing Duration as a mobile and fluid concept Bergson argued that one cannot understand Duration through immobile analysis but only through experiential first-person intuition.

Bergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces. His philosophy emphasises pure mobility unforeseeable novelty creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a process philosophy. It touches upon such topics as time and identity free will perception change memory consciousness language the foundation of mathematics and the limits of reason.

Criticizing Kants theory of knowledge exposed in the Critique of Pure Reason and his conception of truth which he compares to Platos conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics intelligence and intuition and insisted on the necessity of increasing thoughts possibility through the use of intuition which according to him alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life understood as pure duration. Because of his criticism of intelligence he makes a frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of concepts which fail to touch the whole of reality being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things. For instance he says in The Creative Evolution that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible man must throw itself in water and only then can thought consider swimming as possible. Intelligence for Bergson is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty a product of evolution used by man to survive. If metaphysics is to avoid false problems it should not extend the abstract concepts of intelligence to pure speculation but rather use intuition.

The Creative Evolution in particular attempted to think through the continuous creation of life and explicitly pitted itself against Herbert Spencers evolutionary philosophy. Spencer had attempted to transpose Charles Darwins theory of evolution in philosophy and to construct a cosmology based on this theory . Bergson disputed what he saw as Spencers mechanistic philosophy.

Bergsons Lebensphilosophie can be seen as a response to the mechanistic philosophies of his time but also to the failure of finalism. Indeed he considers that finalism is unable to explain duration and the continuous creation of life as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program a notion which remains for example in the expression of a genetic program; such a description of finalism was adopted for instance by Leibniz.

Bergson regarded planning beforehand for the future as impossible since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities. Indeed one could always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility. But in the introduction to the Pensée et le mouvant he explains that such an event created retrospectively its causes taking the example of the creation of a work of art for example a symphony it was impossible to predict what would be the symphony of the future as if the musician knew what symphony would be the best for his time he would realize it. In his words the effect created its cause. Henceforth he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism through the notion of an original impulse the élan vital in life which dispersed itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies .

The foundation of Henri Bergsons philosophy his theory of Duration he discovered when trying to improve the inadequacies of Herbert Spencers philosophy. Bergson introduced Duration as a theory of time and consciousness in his doctoral thesis Time and Free Will An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness as a response to another of his influences Immanuel Kant.

Kant believed that free will could only exist outside of time and space indeed the only non-determined aspect of our private existence in the universe separate to water cycles mathematics and mortality. However we could therefore not know whether or not it exists and that it is nothing but a pragmatic faith. Bergson responded that Kant along with many other philosophers had confused time with its spatial representation. In reality Bergson argued Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts with one causing the other. Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration. For Bergson reality is composed of change.

Duration as defined by Bergson then is a unity and a multiplicity but being mobile it cannot be grasped through immobile concepts. Bergson hence argues that one can grasp it only through his method of intuition. Two images from Henri Bergsons An Introduction to Metaphysics may help one to grasp Bergsons term intuition the limits of concepts and the ability of intuition to grasp the absolute. The first image is that of a city. Analysis or the creation of concepts through the divisions of points of view can only ever give us a model of the city through a construction of photographs taken from every possible point of view yet it can never give us the dimensional value of walking in the city itself. One can only grasp this through intuition; likewise the experience of reading a line of Homer. One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself. The method of intuition then is that of getting back to the things themselves.

Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories ... It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being. If there is finality in the world of life it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace.

In Laughter An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked . He describes the process of laughter used in particular by comics and clowns as caricature of the mechanistic nature of humans one of the two tendencies of life . However Bergson warns us that laughters criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a persons self-esteem. This essay made his opposition to the Cartesian theory of the animal-machine obvious. In criticism of Bergsons hypothesis it is stated that he does not address jokes.

From his first publications Bergsons philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters although he also became very popular and durably influenced French philosophy. The mathematician Édouard Le Roy became Bergsons main disciple. Nonetheless Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Collège de France delivering lectures to a general audience may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas. But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought. Thus Bergsons philosophyin principle open and nonsystematicwas easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers.

Alfred North Whitehead acknowledged Bergsons influence on his process philosophy in his 1929 Process and Reality. However Bertrand Russell Whiteheads collaborator on Principia Mathematica was not so entranced by Bergsons philosophy. Although acknowledging Bergsons literary skills Russell saw Bergsons arguments at best as persuasive or emotive speculation but not at all as any worthwhile example of sound reasoning or philosophical insight. The epistemologist Gaston Bachelard explicitly alluded to him in the last pages of his 1938 book The Formation of the Scientific Mind. Others influenced by Bergson include Vladimir Jankélévitch who wrote a book on him in 1931Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Gilles Deleuze who wrote Le bergsonisme in 1966. The Greek philosopher Helle Lambridis developed an interest in Bergson early in her career and after two publications in 1929 - a book that introduced Bergsons work to the Greek audience and a translation into Greek of Bergsons book LÉnergie spirituelle - the second part of her Introduction to Philosophy I II included his philosophical work on the concept of time although this part was not published until 2004. Bergson also influenced the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Levinas although Merleau-Ponty had reservations about Bergsons philosophy. The Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis studied under Bergson in Paris and his writing and philosophy were profoundly influenced as a result.

Many writers of the early 20th century criticized Bergsons intuitionism indeterminism psychologism and interpretation of the scientific impulse. Those who explicitly criticized Bergson either in published articles or in letters included Bertrand RussellGeorge SantayanaG. E. Moore Ludwig Wittgenstein Martin HeideggerJulien BendaT. S. Eliot Wyndham LewisWallace Stevens Paul Valéry André Gide Jean Piaget Marxist philosophers Theodor W. AdornoLucio CollettiJean-Paul Sartre and Georges Politzer as well as Maurice Blanchot American philosophers such as Irving Babbitt Arthur Lovejoy Josiah Royce The New Realists The Critical Realists Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler Roger Fry Julian Huxley and Virginia Woolf .

The Vatican accused Bergson of pantheism while others have characterized his philosophy as a materialist emergentism Samuel Alexander and C. Lloyd Morgan explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear. According to Henri Hude who supports himself on the whole of Bergsons works as well as his now published courses accusing him of pantheism is a counter-sense. Hude alleges that a mystical experience roughly outlined at the end of Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion is the inner principle of his whole philosophy although this has been contested by other commentators.

Charles Sanders Peirce took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson. In response to a letter comparing their work Peirce wrote a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions.. Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergsons influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for the spirit of the age.

As early as the 1890s Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergsons philosophy above all his view of the New and the indeterminate

According to Santayana and Russell Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom. Russell takes particular exception to Bergsons understanding of number in chapter two of Time and Free-will. According to Russell Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor to describe the nature of mathematics as well as logic in general. Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number possible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms and this again with number in general writes Russell .

Suzanne Guerlac has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower Deleuze within continental philosophy If there is a return to Bergson today then it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson. This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuzes own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned.Leonard Lawlor and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that the recent revitalization of Bergsonism ... is almost entirely due to Deleuze. They explain that Bergsons concept of multiplicity is at the very heart of Deleuzes thought and duration is the model for all of Deleuzes becomings. The other aspect that attracted Deleuze which is indeed connected to the first is Bergsons criticism of the concept of negation in Creative Evolution ... Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the Hegelian dialectic the negative. It is this aspect that Mark Sinclair focuses upon in Bergson . He writes that despite the philosopher and his philosophy being very popular during the early years of the twentieth century his ideas had been critiqued and then rejected first by phenomenology then by existentialism and finally by post-structuralism. As Sinclair goes on to explain over series of publications including Bergsonism and Difference and Repetition Deleuze championed Bergson as a thinker of difference that proceeds any sense of negation In this way Deleuzes interpretation served to keep the flame of Bergsons philosophy alive and it has been a key motivation for the renewed scholarly attention to it.

Ilya Prigogine acknowledged Bergsons influence at his Nobel Prize reception lecture Since my adolescence I have read many philosophical texts and I still remember the spell Lévolution créatrice cast on me. More specifically I felt that some essential message was embedded still to be made explicit in Bergsons remark The more deeply we study the nature of time the better we understand that duration means invention creation of forms continuous elaboration of the absolutely new.

Japanese philosopher Yasushi Hirai from Fukuoka University has led a collaborative and interdisciplinary project from 2007 bringing together Eastern and Western philosophers and scientists to discuss and promote Bergsons work. This has influenced the development of specific artificial neural networks which incorporate features inspired by Bergsons philosophy of memory.

Several Hindu authors have found parallels to Hindu philosophy in Bergsons thought. The integrative evolutionism of Sri Aurobindo an Indian philosopher from the early 20th century has many similarities to Bergsons philosophy. Whether this represents a direct influence of Bergson is disputed although Aurobindo was familiar with many Western philosophers. K Narayanaswami Aiyer a member of the Theosophical Society published a pamphlet titled Professor Bergson and the Hindu Vedanta where he argued that Bergsons ideas on matter consciousness and evolution were in agreement with Vedantic and Puranic explanations. Nalini Kanta Brahma Marie Tudor Garland and Hope Fitz are other authors who have comparatively evaluated Hindu and Bergsonian philosophies especially in relation to intuition consciousness and evolution."
Gilles Bernheim,"Gilles Uriel Bernheim is a French-Israeli rabbi who was formerly the Chief Rabbi of France. Born in Aix-les-Bains Savoie in 1952 he was elected by the general assembly of the Central Consistory chief rabbi of France on 22 June 2008 for a seven-year mandate starting from 1 January 2009. Until then he had been rabbi of synagogue de la Victoire the main synagogue in Paris since 1 May 1997. The Chief Rabbi of France was respected as a scholar not only in the Jewish community but in the wider academic world. However he resigned as chief rabbi in April 2013 before his term had ended amid revelations of plagiarism and deception about his academic credentials.

He succeeded chief rabbi Joseph Sitruk. He was very critical of the lifting of the excommunication of bishop Richard Williamson.

The French Government appointed him Knight in the Légion dhonneur on 10 April 2009.

This essay found a strong echo in Roman Catholic circles culminating in Pope Benedict XVI quoting him at length in his annual addressto the Roman Curia 21 December 2012 

Bernheims father was a wood seller and died when Bernheim was 14. His mother Berthe née Klein is a former pupil of Antoinette Feuerwerker and was a teacher of mathematics. His wife is a psychoanalyst and he is the father of four children.

Gilles Bernheim was a student of Séminaire israélite de France in Paris.

In December 2020 Bernheim emigrated to Israel to join his children and grandchildren living there.

The affair started in early March when the Strass de la Philosophie blog revealed that a passage on hasidic exegesis from Bernheims work was almost identical to an interview of the philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard that appears in the 1996 book Questioning Judaism by Elisabeth Weber.

Bernheim acknowledged that his 2011 book 40 Jewish Meditations contained one passage that his ghostwriter plagiarized without Bernheims knowledge. I have been fooled he wrote. However I am responsible. I apologize to the authors whose texts have been copied to the people who have read these meditations and to my publisher who was not informed of the existence of an outsider.It was also revealed that he did not actually qualify for the prestigious title of agrégé of philosophy that had often been attributed to him. The agrégé title required passing a rigorous examination that was necessary for becoming a professor of philosophy. While he may not have directly claimed to hold that qualification he had allowed others to refer to him using the title without clarifying his actual status.

Le Figaro reported that there was heavy pressure on the part of unnamed officials from the Jewish community for Bernheim to resign. On 11 April 2013 he resigned as chief rabbi."
François Bernier,"François Bernier was a French physician and traveller. He was born in Joué-Etiau in Anjou. He stayed for around 12 years in India.

His 1684 publication Nouvelle division de la terre par les différentes espèces ou races qui lhabitent is considered the first published post-Classical classification of humans into distinct races. He also wrote Travels in the Mughal Empire which is mainly about the reigns of Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb. It is based on his own extensive journeys and observations and on information from eminent Mughal courtiers who had witnessed the events at first hand.

Bernier abridged and translated the philosophical writings of his friend Pierre Gassendi from Latin into French. Initial editions of Berniers Abregé de la Philosophie de Gassendi were published in Paris in 1674 by the family Langlois and in 1675 by Estienne Michallet. A complete edition in eight volumes was published by Anisson and Posuel at Lyon in 1678; Anisson and Posuel joined with Rigaud to publish a second edition in seven volumes in 1684. Bernier objectively and faithfully rendered Gassendis ideas in his Abregé without editorial interjection or invention. However Bernier remained uncomfortable with some of Gassendis notions in 1682 Estienne Michallet was again his publisher putting forth his Doutes de Mr. Bernier sur quelques-uns des principaux Chapitres de son Abregé de la Philosophie de Gassendi.

Source This description of the life of François Bernier is abstracted from a French introduction by France Bhattacharya to an edition of Voyage dans les Etats du Grand Mogol .

A son of a farmer François Bernier was orphaned very young and was cared for by his uncle the curé de Chanzeaux. At the age of 15 he moved to Paris to study at the Collège de Clermont where he was invited to stay at the home of his younger friend Chapelle the natural son of Luillier who was a councillor at the parlement in Metz. There Bernier most probably met Cyrano de Bergerac and Molière and certainly the philosopher Pierre Gassendi whose aide and secretary he became. He developed a taste for travel in the company of monsieur dArpajon the French ambassador to Poland and Germany.

In 1652 during a prolonged stay with Gassendi in the south of France he managed to become a medical doctor on the strength of a speed-course at the famous Faculté de Montpellier an intensive three-month course gave the medical degree providing one did not practice on French national territory.

Liberated from his ties to France by the death of Gassendi in 1655 he set out on his twelve-year journey to the East at 36 years of age Palestine Egypt one year in Cairo Arabia and an attempt to enter Ethiopia which was frustrated by civil war in the interior. In 1658 he debarked at Surat in India in Gujarat state. Attached at first and for a short while to the retinue of Dara Shikohthe history of whose downfall he was to recordhe was installed as a medical doctor at the court of Aurangzeb the last of the great Mughal emperors.

A tour of inspection by Aurangzeb gave Bernier the opportunity to describe Kashmir the first and for a long time the only European to do so. In Voyages de F. Bernier contenant la description des Etats du Grand Mogol de lIndoustan du royaume de Kachemire . He subsequently visited the other extreme of the empire in Bengal. European medical training was highly esteemed amongst the Mughal and gave him access to all ranks of the court even on medically required occasions to the Emperors harem.

After his return from Kashmir he traveled around on his own meeting with Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in Bengal andwhile preparing for a journey to Persia at Suratwith Jean Chardin that other great traveler in the Orient .

He returned once more to Surat to write a memoir on Indian commerce for the use of Jean-Baptiste Colbert . In 1669 Bernier left India for Paris to stay.

In 1671 he almost was jailed for writing in defense of the ideas of René Descartes against whom a judicial arrest had been issuedan exploit he followed with an Abrégé de la Philosophie de Gassendi also not a subject to arouse official approval .

Meanwhile he was a favored guest at some of the great literary salons for example that of Marguerite de la Sablière who introduced him to Jean de La Fontaine; or at that of Ninon de Lenclos. 

In 1685 Bernier visited London where he met with some famous exiles from France Hortense Mancini Duchesse de Mazarin niece of the redoubtable Cardinal; Saint-Évremond; others. He returned to Paris via the Netherlands where he probably visited his philosophical correspondent Pierre Bayle.

Bernier died in 1688 in Paris the year that saw the publication of his Lettre sur le quiétisme des Indes.

Foremost among his correspondents while he was in India had been Jean Chapelain who shipped him crates of books Melchisédech Thévenot and François de La Mothe Le Vayer. From Chapelains correspondence we know of a link with the elder Pétis de la Croix whose son François Pétis de la Croix was sent on a language course to Persia two years after Berniers return from India.

In 1684 Bernier published a brief essay dividing humanity into what he called races distinguishing individuals and particularly women by skin color and a few other physical traits. The article was published anonymously in the Journal des sçavans the earliest academic journal published in Europe and titled New Division of the Earth by the Different Species or Races of Man that Inhabit It. In the essay he distinguished four different races 1 The first race included populations from Europe North Africa the Middle East India south-east Asia and the Americas. 2 The second race consisted of the sub-Saharan Africans 3 the third race consisted of the east- and northeast Asians and 4 the fourth race were Sámi people. The emphasis on different kinds of female beauty can be explained because the essay was the product of French Salon culture. Bernier emphasized that his novel classification was based on his personal experience as a traveler in different parts of the world. Bernier offered a distinction between essential genetic differences and accidental ones that depended on environmental factors. He also suggested that the latter criterion might be relevant to distinguish sub-types. His biological classification of racial types never sought to go beyond physical traits and he also accepted the role of climate and diet in explaining degrees of human diversity. Bernier had been the first to extend the concept of species of man to classify racially the entirety of humanity but he did not established a cultural hierarchy between the so-called races that he had conceived. On the other hand he clearly placed white Europeans as the norm from which other races deviated. The qualities which he attributed to each race were not strictly Eurocentric because he thought that peoples of temperate Europe the Americas and India culturally very different belonged to roughly the same racial group and he explained the differences between the civilizations of India and Europe through climate and institutional history. By contrast he emphasized the biological difference between Europeans and Africans and made very negative comments towards the Sami of the coldest climates of Northern Europe and about Africans living at the Cape of Good Hope. He wrote for example The Lappons compose the 4th race. They are a small and short race with thick legs wide shoulders a short neck and a face that I dont know how to describe except that its long truly awful and seems reminiscent of a bears face. Ive only ever seen them twice in Danzig but according to the portraits Ive seen and from what Ive heard from a number of people theyre ugly animals. The significance of Bernier for the emergence of what Joan-Pau Rubiés call the modern racial discourse has been debated with Siep Stuurman calling it the beginning of modern racial thought while Joan-Pau Rubiés think it is less significant if Berniers entire view of humanity is taken into account.

By virtue of being the first to propose a system of racial classification that extended to all of humanity Berniers racial categories contributed to the genesis of scientific racism. Inherently his classifications were based on physical and biological differences in human appearance and thus sought to suggest a scientific basis for human racial variation. As previously mentioned Bernier makes a distinction between physical variation due to environmental factors and racial factors. For instance he classifies Indians that he is exposed to during his stint in the Mughal courts as part of the white race. He asserts that Indians like Egyptians have a skin color that is accidental resulting from their exposure to the sun. However when it comes to categorizing Africans he notes that Blackness is an essential feature of theirs. Bernier evidences the fact that their color is not due to environmental factors by asserting that they will be Black even when living in colder climes. Berniers conception of biological or racial difference and variation due to climatic features is blurry but contributed to the eventual development of theories of scientific racism. At the time that he published his work it did not cause a splash he founded no school of thought at the time. Scientific thinking upon the time he wrote the text had shifted from systems where evidence was based on analogies like Bernier had used to a system supported by fixed laws of nature. Thus the context of scientific discourse at the time meant Bernier did not receive huge attention for his classification in the second half of the 17th century and he remained a man of the salons.

One of the things the newly arriving physician François Bernier noticed in Aurangzebs capital was the embroidered dressing of the Mughal Emperors subjects he writes in his Travels in the Moghal Empire Large halls are seen in many places called Karkanahs or workshops for the artisans. In one hall embroiderers are busily employed superintended by a master. He continued Manufactures of silk fine brocade and other fine muslins of which are made turbans girdles of gold flowers and drawers worn by Mughal females so delicately fine as to wear out in one night were one of the most expensive forms of clothing ins the world or even more when embroidered with fine needlework.

In India Bernier came under the protection of Daneshmand Khan an important official at the court of Aurangzeb. Mullah Shafiai was secretary of state for foreign affairs grand master of the horse later treasurer and governor of Delhi . Bernier and Daneshmand seem to have been on terms of mutual esteem and Bernier always refers to him as my Agha.

Two excerpts from Travels in the Mughal Empire illustrate the interchange that followed. The importance of the detail could only fully be appreciated in the last decades of the 20th century following the contributions by Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr to the history of Islamic philosophy.

A candidate for becoming Berniers pandit probably would have come from the circle around Hindu scholars such as Jagannatha Panditaraja who still was at work under Shah Jahan or Kavindracharya who taught Dara Sikhoh Sanskrit.Godes argument that this pandit was none other than Kavīndrācārya Sarasvatī himselfhas won general acceptance. His intellectual partner could be someone like Zulfaqar Ardistani author of the Dabistan-i Mazahib an overview of religious diversity . He was educated perhaps by Mir Abul-Qasim Astrabadi Findiriski a link between the religious tolerance aspect of the great project of Persian translations initiated by Akbar and continued by his great-grandson Dara Shikoh and the School of Isfahan near the end of the Safavid reign; or perhaps he was educated by Hakim Kamran Shirazi to whom Mir Findiriski referred as elder brother who studied Christian theology and the Gospel under Portuguese priests traveled to India to study Sanskrit Shastra lived with the yogi Chatrupa at Benares and died chanting the liberation of the philosophers at the age of 100. Those were scholars who had a knowledge of Greek peripatetic philosophers as well as respect for Ibn Sina and Shihabuddin Yahya Suhrawardi Maqtul .

France Battacharya notes that she removed in her critical edition based on the 1724 edition the chapter Lettre à Chapelle sur les atomesas being not so relevant to the context."
Henri Berr,Henri Berr was a French philosopher and lycée teacher known as the founder of the journal Revue de synthèse. He is credited with moving the centre of gravity of the study of history in France in accordance with his ideas on synthesis. Despite the lack of recognition of his concepts by the academic establishment of the time and its adverse effect on his own career he had a large impact on the younger generation of French historians. He is considered to have anticipated significant aspects of the later Annales School.
Jean-Michel Berthelot,"Jean-Michel Berthelot was a French sociologist philosopher epistemologist and social theorist specialist in philosophy of social sciences history of sociology sociology of education sociology of knowledge sociology of science and sociology of the body.

Former student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure Jean Michel Berthelot began his career as a teacher of philosophy in secondary education. After a PhD under the direction of Raymond Ledrut he became professor of sociology at the University of Toulouse from 1982 to 1997 where he directed the CERS and the doctoral school. In 1997 he joined the University of Paris Sorbonne first Paris V and then Paris IV. He was Secretary General of the International Association of French speaking sociologists Language from 1992 to 2000 as well as Secretary General of the journal Les Cahiers Internationaux de Sociologie.

Berthelots philosophy and history of social sciences was influenced by Kant French historical epistemology of Bachelard Canguilhem Koyré and Gaston Granger the falsifiability of Popper and Lakatos and the epistemological reflections of sociologists from Durkheim Weber and Simmel to Passeron Adorno and Habermas.

Jean-Michel Berthelots epistemological work combined the philosophy and history of science in the study of sociological theories to understand the logic of construction and justification of sociological knowledge. Berthelot created a typology of sociological explanations constituted by six logical schemas of intelligibility causal actancial hermeneutic structural functionalist and dialectic. These types of explanation were the result of formalization of theory and arguments in the history of sociology.

Berthelot at the same time criticized the epistemic relativism and defended the pluralism and openness in sociology which makes him in the contemporary debate on philosophy of social sciences a rationalist and constructivist. The pluralism in sociology in Berthelots epistemology is not only inevitably but even fruitful for the research and theoretical debate."

Maine de Biran,"François-Pierre-Gontier de Biran usually known as Maine de Biran was a French philosopher.

Maine de Biran was born at Bergerac; died at Paris 16 July 1824. The name Maine he assumed from an estate called Le Maine near Mouleydier. After studying with distinction at Périgueux he entered the life guards of King Louis XVI of France and was present at Versailles during the events of October 1789. 

He entered politics and was part of the Conseil des Cinq Cents in April 1797; however as he incurred the hostility of the Directory by his royalist sympathies he withdrew to his patrimonial inheritance of Grateloup near Bergerac where he avoided the excesses of the French Revolution and where he devoted himself to philosophy. It was at this period that to use his own words he passed per saltum from frivolity to philosophy. He began with psychology which he made the study of his life. 

After the Reign of Terror Maine de Biran took part in politics and was elected to parliament in 1812 1815 and 1820. Having been excluded from the Council of the Five Hundred on suspicion of royalism he took part with his friend Joseph Lainé in the commission of 1813 which first expressed direct opposition to the will of the emperor Napoleon. After the restoration of the monarchy he became treasurer to the chamber of deputies retiring during each autumn recess to study at home.

His constitution was delicate and sensitive and his philosophic bent had already manifested itself by his observations on the influence of the physical state on the moral. As an ideologist he won the prize at the Institut with his essay Sur lhabitude ; but his Décomposition de la pensée shows him deviating from the theory of that school and in La perception immédiate and Rapports du physique et du morale de lhomme he is an opponent of the eighteenth-century philosophy. In his latter days his tendency to mysticism gradually brought him back towards practical Christianity and he died a faithful child of the Catholic Church.

He married twice in 1795 and 1814 and had a son Félix in 1796 and two daughters Eliza 1797 and Adine 1800 who all bore the new surname of Maine de Biran. His son Félix having only daughters the name Maine de Biran died out in 1879 before being taken over at the end of the 19th century by the natural son of a distant niece Françoise Gontier de Biran known as Nelly with an unknown man.

Only a few of Maine de Birans writings appeared during his lifetime the essay on habit a critical review of Pierre Laromiguières lectures and the philosophical portion of the article Leibnitz in the Biographie universelle . A treatise on the analysis of thought was never printed. In 1834 these writings together with the essay entitled Nouvelles considérations sur les rapports du physique et du moral de lhomme were published by Victor Cousin who in 1841 added three volumes under the title Œuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran. But the publication by Édouard Naville of the Œuvres inédites de Maine de Biran in three volumes first rendered possible a connected view of his philosophical development.

At first a sensualist like Condillac and John Locke next an intellectualist he finally became a mystical theosophist. The Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie represents the second stage of his philosophy the fragments of the Nouveaux essais danthropologie the third. Maine de Birans early essays in philosophy were written from the point of view of Locke and Condillac but showed signs of his later interests. Dealing with the formation of habits he is compelled to note that passive impressions do not furnish a complete or adequate explanation. With Laromiguière he distinguishes attention as an active effort of no less importance than the passive receptivity of sense and like Joseph Butler he distinguishes passively formed customs from active habits. He concluded that Condillacs notion of passive receptivity as the one source of conscious experience was an error of method in short that the mechanical mode of viewing consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive. For it he proposed to substitute the genetic method whereby human conscious experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its essential basis in connection with external conditions. The essential basis he finds in the real consciousness of self as an active striving power and the stages of its development corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness he designates as the affective the perceptive and the reflective. In connexion with this Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing with conscious experience such as the mode by which the organism is cognized the mode by which the organism is distinguished from extra-organic things and the nature of those general ideas by which the relations of things are known to us cause power force etc.

In the last stage of his philosophy Biran distinguished the animal existence from the human under which the three forms above noted are classed. And both from the life of the spirit in which human thought is brought into relation with the supersensible divine system of things. This stage is left imperfect. Altogether Birans work presents a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by preference to the psychological aspect of experience.

So it has been said there are three stages marking the development of his philosophy. Up to 1804 a stage called by Naville the philosophy of sensation he was a follower of Condillacs sensism as modified by de Tracy which he soon abandoned in favour of a system based on an analysis of internal reflection. In the second stage the philosophy of will 1804-18 to avoid materialism and fatalism he embraced the doctrine of immediate apperception showing that man knows himself and exterior things by the resistance to his effort. On reflecting he remarks the voluntary effort which differentiates his internal from his external experience thus learning to distinguish between the ego and the non-ego. In the third stage the philosophy of religion after 1818 we find de Biran advocating a mystical intuitional psychology. To mans two states of life representation and volition he adds a third love or life of union with God in which the life of Divine grace absorbs representation and volition. Maine de Birans style is laboured but he is reckoned by Cousin as the greatest French metaphysician from the time of Malebranche. His genius was not fully recognized till after his death as the essay Sur lhabitude was the only book that appeared under his name during his lifetime; but his reputation was firmly established on the publication of his writings partly by Cousin and partly by Naville .

Schopenhauer claimed that No one has carried this confusion or rather identification of natural force with cause so far as Maine de Biran in his Nouvelles considérations des rapports du physique au moral since this is essential to his philosophy. This confusion of force of nature and cause occurred often throughout the book. hen he speaks of causes he hardly ever puts cause alone but almost always says cause ou force. Schopenhauer believed that the confusion was intentional. Biran was conscious of identifying two disparate concepts in order to be able to make use of either of them according to the circumstances. Therefore he purposely equated cause with force in order to keep the identification present in the readers mind."
Michel Bitbol,"Michel Bitbol is a French researcher in philosophy of science.

He is Directeur de recherche at CNRS previously in the Centre de Recherche en Epistémologie Appliquée of École polytechnique . He is now a member of Archives Husserl Ecole Normale Superieure .

His research interests are mainly focused on the influence of quantum physics on philosophy. He first worked on Erwin Schrödingers metaphysics and philosophy of physics.

Using theorems demonstrated by Jean-Louis Destouches Paulette Destouches-Février and R.I.G. Hughes he pointed out that the structure of quantum mechanics may be derived to a large extent from the assumption that microscopic phenomena cannot be dissociated from their experimental context. His views on quantum mechanics converge with ideas developed by Julian Schwinger and Asher Peres according to whom quantum mechanics is a symbolism of atomic measurements rather than a description of atomic objects. He also defends ideas close to Anton Zeilingers by claiming that quantum laws do not express the nature of physical objects but only the bounds of experimental information.

Along with this view quantum mechanics is no longer considered as a physical theory in the ordinary sense but rather as a background framework for physical theories since it goes back to the most elementary conditions which allow us to formulate any physical theory whatsoever. Some reviewers suggested half-seriously to call this view of physics Kantum physics. Indeed Michel Bitbol often refers to the philosophy of I. Kant according to whom one can understand the contents of knowledge only by analyzing the conditions of possibility of such knowledge.

He was granted an award by the French Académie des sciences morales et politiques in 1997 for his work in the philosophy of quantum mechanics.

Later on he concentrated on the philosophy of mind and consciousness defending a strongly anti-reductionist and neo-Wittgensteinian view. He collaborated with Francisco Varela on this subject. 

His most recent work is a systematic criticism of one of the original versions of speculative realism formulated by Quentin Meillassoux. The title of his book published in 2019 is a direct reply to Meillassouxs After Finitude.

He participated in the 20022013 conferences of the Mind and Life Institute whose aim is to promote a dialogue between science and Buddhism. He subsequently wrote a book developing a thoroughly relational reading of quantum mechanics with due reference to the Buddhist concept of dependent arising."
Antoine Blanc de Saint-Bonnet,Antoine Blanc de Saint-Bonnet was a French philosopher whose ideas were a precursor to modern sociology.
Robert Blanché,"Robert Blanché was an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Toulouse. He wrote many books addressing the philosophy of mathematics.

Robert Blanché died in 1975. Nine years before in 1966 he published with Vrin Structures intellectuelles. Therein he deals with the logical hexagon. Whereas the logical square or square of Apuleius represents four values AEIO the logical hexagon represents six that is to say not only AEIO but also two new values Y and U. It is advisable to read the article logical hexagon as well what concerns Indian logic.

In La Logique et son histoire d Aristote à Russell published with Armand Colin in 1970 Robert Blanché the author of Structures intellectuelles mentions that Józef Maria Bocheński speaks of a sort of Indian logical triangle to be compared with the square of Aristotle in other words with the square of opposition."
Maurice Blanchot,"Maurice Blanchot was a French writer philosopher and literary theorist. His work had a strong influence on post-structuralist philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze Michel Foucault Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy.

Blanchot was born in the village of Quain on 22 September 1907.

Blanchot studied philosophy at the University of Strasbourg where he became a close friend of the Lithuanian-born French Jewish phenomenologist Emmanuel Levinas. He then embarked on a career as a political journalist in Paris. From 1932 to 1940 he was editor of the mainstream conservative daily the Journal des débats. In 1930 he earned his DES roughly equivalent to an M.A. at the University of Paris with a thesis titled La Conception du Dogmatisme chez les Sceptiques anciens daprès Sextus Empiricus .

Early in the 1930s he contributed to a series of radical nationalist magazines while also serving as editor of the fiercely anti-German daily Le rempart in 1933 and as editor of Paul Lévys anti-Nazi polemical weekly Aux écoutes. In 1936 and 1937 he also contributed to the far right monthly Combat and to the nationalist-syndicalist daily LInsurgé which eventually ceased publication largely as a result of Blanchots intervention because of the anti-semitism of some of its contributors. There is no dispute that Blanchot was nevertheless the author of a series of violently polemical articles attacking the government of the day and its confidence in the politics of the League of Nations and warned persistently against the threat to peace in Europe posed by Nazi Germany.

In December 1940 he met Georges Bataille who had written strong anti-fascist articles in the thirties and who would remain a close friend until his death in 1962. Blanchot worked in Paris during the Nazi occupation. In order to support his family he continued to work as a book reviewer for the Journal des débats from 1941 to 1944 writing for instance about such figures as Sartre and Camus Bataille and Michaux Mallarmé and Duras for a putatively Pétainist Vichy readership. In these reviews he laid the foundations for later French critical thinking by examining the ambiguous rhetorical nature of language and the irreducibility of the written word to notions of truth or falsity. He refused the editorship of the collaborationist Nouvelle Revue Française for which as part of an elaborate ploy he had been suggested by Jean Paulhan. He was active in the Resistance and remained a bitter opponent of the fascist anti-semitic novelist and journalist Robert Brasillach who was the principal leader of the pro-Nazi collaborationist movement. In June 1944 Blanchot was almost executed by a Nazi firing squad .

After the war Blanchot began working only as a novelist and literary critic. In 1947 Blanchot left Paris for the secluded village of Èze in the south of France where he spent the next decade of his life. Like Sartre and other French intellectuals of the era Blanchot avoided the academy as a means of livelihood instead relying on his pen. Importantly from 1953 to 1968 he published regularly in Nouvelle Revue Française. At the same time he began a lifestyle of relative isolation often not seeing close friends for years while continuing to write lengthy letters to them. Part of the reason for his self-imposed isolation was the fact that for most of his life Blanchot suffered from poor health.

Blanchots political activities after the war shifted to the left. He is widely credited with being one of the main authors of the important Manifesto of the 121 named after the number of its signatories who included Jean-Paul Sartre Robert Antelme Alain Robbe-Grillet Marguerite Duras René Char Henri Lefebvre Alain Resnais Simone Signoret and others which supported the rights of conscripts to refuse to serve in the colonial war in Algeria. The manifesto was crucial to the intellectual response to the war.

In May 1968 Blanchot once again emerged from personal obscurity in support of the student protests. It was his sole public appearance after the war. Yet for fifty years he remained a consistent champion of modern literature and its tradition in French letters. During the later years of his life he repeatedly wrote against the intellectual attraction to fascism and notably against Heideggers post-war silence over the Holocaust.

Blanchot wrote more than thirty works of fiction literary criticism and philosophy. Up to the 1970s he worked continually in his writing to break the barriers between what are generally perceived as different genres or tendencies and much of his later work moves freely between narration and philosophical investigation.

In 1983 Blanchot published La Communauté inavouable . This work inspired The Inoperative Community Jean-Luc Nancys attempt to approach community in a non-religious non-utilitarian and un-political exegesis.

He died on 20 February 2003 in Le Mesnil-Saint-Denis Yvelines France.

Blanchots work is not a coherent all-encompassing theory since it is a work founded on paradox and impossibility. The thread running through all his writing is the constant engagement with the question of literature a simultaneous enactment and interrogation of the profoundly strange experience of writing. For Blanchot literature begins at the moment when literature becomes a question .

Blanchot draws on the work of the symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé and the negative of the Hegelian dialectic in formulating his conception of literary language as anti-realist and distinct from everyday experience. I say flower Mallarmé writes in Poetry in Crisis and outside the oblivion to which my voice relegates any shape insofar as it is something other than the calyx there arises musically as the very idea and delicate the one absent from every bouquet.

In the everyday use of language words are the vehicles of ideas. The word flower means flower that refers to flowers in the world. No doubt it is possible to read literature in this way but literature is more than this everyday use of language. For in literature flower does not just mean flower but many things and it can only do so because the word is independent from what it signifies. This independence which is passed over in the everyday use of language is the negativity at the heart of language. The word means something because it negates the physical reality of the thing. Only in this way can the idea arise. The absence of the thing is made good by the presence of the idea. What the everyday use of language steps over to make use of the idea and what literature remains fascinated by is the absence of the physical materiality of thing annihilated from its existence. Literary language therefore is a double negation both of the thing and the idea. It is in this space that literature becomes possible where words take on a strange and mysterious reality of their own and where also meaning and reference remain allusive and ambiguous.

Blanchots best-known fictional works are Thomas lObscur an unsettling récit about the experience of reading and loss; Death Sentence; Aminadab and The Most High . His central theoretical works are Literature and the Right to Death The Space of Literature The Infinite Conversation and The Writing of the Disaster.

Blanchot engages with Heidegger on the question of the philosophers death showing how literature and death are both experienced as anonymous passivity an experience that Blanchot variously refers to as the Neutral . Unlike Heidegger Blanchot rejects the possibility of an authentic relation to death because he rejects the possibility of death that is to say of the individuals experience of death. He thus rejects in total the possibility of understanding and properly engaging with it; and this resonates with Levinas take too. Blanchot reverses Heideggers position on death as the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Dasein instead viewing death as the impossibility of every possibility.

Blanchot also draws heavily from Franz Kafka and his fictional work is shot through with an engagement with Kafkas writing.

Blanchots work was also strongly influenced by his friends Georges Bataille and Emmanuel Levinas. Blanchots later work in particular is influenced by Levinasian ethics and the question of responsibility to the Other. On the other hand Blanchots own literary works like the famous Thomas the Obscure heavily influenced Levinass and Batailles ideas about the possibility that our vision of reality is blurred because of the use of words . This search for the real reality is illustrated by the works of Paul Celan and Stéphane Mallarmé.

The main biography of Blanchot is an intellectual biography by Christophe Bident Maurice Blanchot partenaire invisible.

Many of Blanchots principal translators into English established reputations as prose stylists and poets in their own right; some of the more well-known include Lydia Davis Paul Auster and Pierre Joris."
Maurice Blondel,"Maurice Blondel was a French philosopher whose most influential works notably LAction aimed at establishing the correct relationship between autonomous philosophical reasoning and Christian belief.

Blondel was born in Dijon in 1861. He came from a family who were traditionally connected to the legal profession but chose early in life to follow a career in philosophy. In 1881 he gained admission to the École Normale Supérieure of Paris. In 1893 he finished his thesis LAction a critical essay of life and of a science of the practice. He was at this time refused a teaching post because his philosophical conclusions were deemed to be too Christian and therefore compromising of philosophical reason. In 1895 however with the help of his former teacher Émile Boutroux he became a Maître de Conférences at Lille then shortly after at Aix-en-Provence where he became a professor in 1897. He would remain in Aix-en-Provence for the rest of his career.

In LAction Blondel developed a philosophy of action in which he applies the method of phenomenology. This leads him to the first order issue of action critiquing the Enlightenment enshrinement of thought which he subsumes under the category of action. This leads him to discover the distinction between the willing will and the willed will. This distinction shows a real insufficiency between the two elements of the will. The problem of connaturility - that man cannot desire something which cannot be fulfilled - leads to investigating how the willing will can be fulfilled in the willed will. This insufficiency leads him to eventually hypothesize the supernatural as the only real possibility. He insists that this is as far as a philosopher can go that the supernatural is the real end of man and that the content of the supernatural is left to the realm of theology.

His subsequent works the Letter on Apologetics and History and Dogma were also connected to the philosophical problem of religion. They unleashed an enormous controversy at the time of publication. Pope Pius Xs 1907 encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis targeted the Modernist threat to Catholic thought and Blondels thought remained associated with the Modernists. Blondel however was never the target of Pascendi and he received letters through the Archbishop of Aix from numerous Popes affirming he was not under suspicion. He did however have great influence on later Catholic thought especially through ressourcement theologians such as Henri de Lubac.

His wife died in 1919 and in 1927 he retired for health reasons. Between 1934 and 1937 he published a trilogy dedicated to thought being and action. In 1935 he published an essay of concrete and integrale ontology Lêtre et les êtres and in 1946 he published Lesprit chrétien .

Blondel died in Aix-en-Provence in 1949. He was the younger brother of historian Georges Blondel and a first cousin of physicist André Blondel.

A nine-volume edition of the complete works of Blondel is being published. Two volumes have been published."
Jean Bodin,"Jean Bodin was a French jurist and political philosopher member of the Parlement of Paris and professor of law in Toulouse. He is best known for his theory of sovereignty; he was also an influential writer on demonology.

Bodin lived during the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He remained a nominal Catholic throughout his life but was critical of papal authority over governments favouring the strong central control of a national monarchy as an antidote to factional strife. Towards the end of his life he wrote a dialogue among different religions including representatives of Judaism Islam and natural theology in which all agreed to coexist in concord but was not published. 

Bodin was successively a friar academic professional lawyer and political adviser. An excursion as a politician having proved a failure he lived out his life as a provincial magistrate.

Bodin was born near Angers possibly the son of a master tailor into a modestly prosperous middle-class background. He received a decent education apparently in the Carmelite monastery of Angers where he became a novice friar. Some claims made about his early life remain obscure. There is some evidence of a visit to Geneva in 154748 in which he became involved in a heresy trial. The records of this episode however are murky and may refer to another person.

He obtained release from his vows in 1549 and went to Paris. He studied at the university but also at the humanist-oriented Collège des Quatre Langues ; he was for two years a student under Guillaume Prévost a little-known magister in philosophy. His education was not only influenced by an orthodox Scholastic approach but was also apparently in contact with Ramist philosophy .

Later in the 1550s he studied Roman law at the University of Toulouse under Arnaud du Ferrier and taught there. His special subject at that time seems to have been comparative jurisprudence. Subsequently he worked on a Latin translation of Oppian of Apamea under the continuing patronage of Gabriel Bouvery Bishop of Angers. Bodin had a plan for a school on humanist principles in Toulouse but failed to raise local support. He left in 1560.

From 1561 he was licensed as an attorney of the Parlement of Paris. His religious convictions on the outbreak of the Wars of Religion in 1562 cannot be determined but he affirmed formally his Catholic faith taking an oath that year along with other members of the Parlement. He continued to pursue his interests in legal and political theory in Paris publishing significant works on historiography and economics.

Bodin became a member of the discussion circles around the Prince François dAlençon . He was the intelligent and ambitious youngest son of Henry II and was in line for the throne in 1574 with the death of his brother Charles IX. He withdrew his claim however in favor of his older brother Henry III who had recently returned from his abortive effort to reign as the King of Poland. Alençon was a leader of the politiques faction of political pragmatists.

After the failure of Prince François hopes to ascend the throne Bodin transferred his allegiance to the new king Henry III. In practical politics however he lost the kings favor in 15767 as delegate of the Third Estate at the Estates-General at Blois and leader in his Estate of the February 1577 moves to prevent a new war against the Huguenots. He attempted to exert a moderating influence on the Catholic party and also tried restrict the passage of supplemental taxation for the king. Bodin then retired from political life; he had married in February 1576. His wife Françoise Trouillart was the widow of Claude Bayard and sister of Nicolas Trouillart who died in 1587; both were royal attorneys in the Provost of Laon and attorneys in the Bailiwick of Vermandois and Bodin took over the charges.

Bodin was in touch with William Wade in Paris Lord Burghleys contact at the time of publication of the Six livres. He later accompanied Prince François by then Duke of Anjou to England in 1581 in his second attempt to woo Elizabeth I of England. On this visit Bodin saw the English Parliament. He brushed off a request to secure better treatment for English Catholics to the dismay of Robert Persons given that Edmund Campion was in prison at the time. Bodin saw some of Campions trial he is said also to have witnessed Campions execution in December 1581 making the hanging the occasion for a public letter against the use of force in matters of religion. Bodin became a correspondent of Francis Walsingham; and Michel de Castelnau passed on to Mary Queen of Scots a prophecy supposed to be Bodins on the death of Elizabeth at the time of the Babington Plot.

Prince François became Duke of Brabant in 1582 however and embarked on an adventurers campaign to expand his territory. The disapproving Bodin accompanied him and was trapped in the Princes disastrous raid on Antwerp that ended the attempt followed shortly by the Princes death in 1584.

In the wars that followed the death of Henry III the Catholic League attempted to prevent the succession of the Protestant Henry of Navarre by placing another king on the throne. Bodin initially gave support to the powerful League; he felt it inevitable that they would score a quick victory.

He died in Laon during one of the many plague epidemics of the time.

Bodin generally wrote in French with later Latin translations. Several of the works have been seen as influenced by Ramism at least in terms of structure.

Bodin wrote in turn books on history economics politics demonology and natural philosophy; and also left a work in manuscript on religion . A modern edition of Bodins works was begun in 1951 as Oeuvres philosophiques de Jean Bodin by Pierre Mesnard but only one volume appeared.

In France Bodin was noted as a historian for his Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem . He wrote Of history that is the true narration of things there are three kinds human natural and divine. This book was one of the most significant contributions to the ars historica of the period and distinctively put an emphasis on the role of political knowledge in interpreting historical writings. He pointed out that the knowledge of historical legal systems could be useful for contemporary legislation.

The Methodus was a successful and influential manual on the writing of technical history. It answered by means of detailed historiographical advice the skeptical line on the possibility of historical knowledge advanced by Francesco Patrizzi. It also expanded the view of historical data found in earlier humanists with the immediacy of its concerns for the social side of human life.

Bodin rejected the biblical Four Monarchies model taking an unpopular position at the time as well as the classical theory of a Golden Age for its naiveté. He also dropped much of the rhetorical apparatus of the humanists.

The Réponse de J. Bodin aux paradoxes de M. de Malestroit was a tract provoked by theories of Jean de Malestroit in which Bodin offered one of the earliest scholarly analyses of the phenomenon of inflation unknown prior to the 16th century. The background to discussion in the 1560s was that by 1550 an increase in the money supply in Western Europe had brought general benefits. But there had also been appreciable inflation. Silver arriving via Spain from the South American mine of Potosí together with other sources of silver and gold from other new sources was causing monetary change.

Bodin was after Martín de Azpilicueta who had alluded to the issue in 1556 an early observer that the rise in prices was due in large part to the influx of precious metals. Analysing the phenomenon amongst other factors he pointed to the relationship between the amount of goods and the amount of money in circulation. The debates of the time laid the foundation for the quantity theory of money. Bodin mentioned other factors population increase trade the possibility of economic migration and consumption that he saw as profligate.

The Theatrum Universae Naturae is Bodins statement of natural philosophy. It contains many particular and even idiosyncratic personal views for instance that eclipses are related to political events. It argued against the certainty of the astronomical theory of stellar parallax and the terrestrial origin of the comet of 1573 . This work shows major Ramist influences. Consideration of the orderly majesty of God leads to encyclopedism about the universe and an analogue of a memory system.

Problems of Bodin became attached to some Renaissance editions of Aristotelian problemata in natural philosophy. Further Damian Siffert compiled a Problemata Bodini which was based on the Theatrum.

Bodins best-known work was written in 1576. The discussion regarding the best form of government which took place in those years around the St. Bartholomews Day massacre gave the inspiration; Bodin attempted to embark on a middle path. Machiavelli would have granted the sovereign the right to act for the benefit of his state without moral consideration and Protestant theorists advocated a popular government or at least an elective monarchy. Bodins classical definition of sovereignty is la puissance absolue et perpetuelle dune République . His main ideas about sovereignty are found in chapter VIII and X of Book I including his statement The sovereign Prince is accountable only to God.

The Six livres were an immediate success and were frequently reprinted. A revised and expanded Latin translation by the author appeared in 1586. With this work Bodin became one of the founders of the pragmatic inter-confessional group known as the politiques who ultimately succeeded in ending the Wars of Religion under King Henry IV with the Edict of Nantes . Against the monarchomachs who were assailing kingship in his time such as Theodore Beza and François Hotman Bodin succeeded in writing a fundamental and influential treatise of social and political theory. In its reasoning against all types of mixed constitution and resistance theory it was an effective counter-attack against the monarchomach position invoking popular sovereignty.

The structure of the earlier books has been described as Ramist in structure. Book VI contains astrological and numerological reasoning. Bodin invoked Pythagoras in discussing justice and in Book IV used ideas related to the Utopia of Thomas More The use of language derived from or replacing Niccolò Machiavellis città as political unit is thoughtful; Bodin introduced republic as a term for matters of public law . Bodin although he referred to Tacitus was not writing here in the tradition of classical republicanism. The Ottoman Empire is analysed as a seigneurial monarchy. The Republic of Venice is not accepted in the terms of Gasparo Contarini it is called an aristocratic constitution not a mixed one with a concentric structure and its apparent stability was not attributable to the form of government.

The ideas in the Six livres on the importance of climate in the shaping of a peoples character were also influential finding a prominent place in the work of Giovanni Botero and later in Baron de Montesquieus climatic determinism. Based on the assumption that a countrys climate shapes the character of its population and hence to a large extent the most suitable form of government Bodin postulated that a hereditary monarchy would be the ideal regime for a temperate nation such as France. This power should be sovereign i.e. not be subject to any other branch though to some extent limited by institutions like the high courts and representative assemblies . Above all the monarch is responsible only to God that is must stand above confessional factions.

The work soon became widely known. Gaspar de Anastro made a Spanish translation in 1590.Richard Knolles put together an English translation ; this was based on the 1586 Latin version but in places follows other versions. It appeared under the title The Six Bookes of a Common-weale.

Bodins major work on sorcery and the witchcraft persecutions was first issued in 1580 ten editions being published by 1604. In it he elaborates the influential concept of pact witchcraft based on a deal with the Devil and the belief that the evil spirit would use a strategy to impose doubt on judges to look upon magicians as madmen and hypochondriacs deserving of compassion rather than chastisement.

The book relates histories of sorcerers but does not mention Faust and his pact. It gave a report of a 1552 public exorcism in Paris and of the case of Magdalena de la Cruz of Cordova an abbess who had confessed to sexual relations with the Devil over three decades. Bodin cited Pierre Marner on werewolf accounts from Savoie. He denounced the works of Cornelius Agrippa and the perceived traffic in sorceries carried out along the Spanish Road running along eastern France for much of its length.

He wrote in extreme terms about procedures in sorcery trials opposing the normal safeguards of justice. This advocacy of relaxation was aimed directly at the existing standards laid down by the Parlement of Paris . He asserted that not even one witch could be erroneously condemned if the correct procedures were followed because rumours concerning sorcerers were almost always true. Bodins attitude has been called a populationist strategy typical of mercantilism.

The book was influential in the debate over witchcraft; it was translated into German by Johann Fischart and in the same year into Latin by François Du Jon as De magorum dæmonomania libri IV. It was quoted by Jean de Léry writing about the Tupinamba people of what is now Brazil.

One surviving copy of the text located in the University of Southern Californias Special Collections Library is a rare presentation copy signed by Bodin himself and is one of only two known surviving texts that feature such an inscription by the author. The USC Démonomanie dedication is to a C.L. Varroni thought to be a legal colleague of Bodins.

Bodin became well known for his analysis of sovereignty which he took to be indivisible and to involve full legislative powers . With François Hotman and François Baudouin on the other hand Bodin also supported the force of customary law seeing Roman law alone as inadequate.

He hedged the absolutist nature of his theory of sovereignty which was an analytical concept; if later his ideas were used in a different normative fashion that was not overtly the reason in Bodin. Sovereignty could be looked at as a bundle of attributes; in that light the legislative role took centre stage and other marks of sovereignty could be discussed further as separate issues. He was a politique in theory which was the moderate position of the period in French politics; but drew the conclusion that only passive resistance to authority was justified.

Bodins work on political theory saw the introduction of the modern concept of state but was in the fact on the cusp of usage with the older meaning of a monarch maintaining his state not having dropped away.Public office belonged to the commonwealth and its holders had a personal responsibility for their actions. Politics is autonomous and the sovereign is subject to divine and natural law but not to any church; the obligation is to secure justice and religious worship in the state.

Bodin studied the balance of liberty and authority. He had no doctrine of separation of powers and argued in a traditional way about royal prerogative and its proper limited sphere. His doctrine was one of balance as harmony with numerous qualifications; as such it could be used in different manners and was. The key was that the central point of power should be above faction. Rose sees Bodins politics as ultimately theocratic and misunderstood by the absolutists who followed him.

Where Aristotle argued for six types of state Bodin allowed only monarchy aristocracy and democracy. He advocated however distinguishing the form of state from the form of government . Bodin had a low opinion of democracy.

Families were the basic unit and model for the state; on the other hand John Milton found in Bodin an ally on the topic of divorce. Respect for individual liberty and possessions were the hallmark of the orderly state a view Bodin shared with Hotman and George Buchanan. He argued against slavery.

In matters of law and politics Bodin saw religion as a social prop encouraging respect for law and governance.

He praised printing as outshining any achievement of the ancients. The idea that the Protestant Reformation was driven by economic and political forces is attributed to him. He is identified as the first person to realize the rapid rate of change of early modern Europe.

In physics he is credited as the first modern writer to use the concept of physical laws to define change but his idea of nature included the action of spirits. In politics he adhered to the ideas of his time in considering a political revolution in the nature of an astronomical cycle a changement or simply a change in English; from Polybius Bodin took the idea of anacyclosis or cyclic change of constitution. Bodins theory was that governments had begun as monarchical had then been democratic before becoming aristocratic.

In 1576 Bodin was engaged in French politics and then argued against the use of compulsion in matters of religion if unsuccessfully. Wars he considered should be subject to statecraft and matters of religion did not touch the state.

Bodin argued that a state might contain several religions; this was a very unusual position for his time if shared by Michel de lHôpital and William the Silent. It was attacked by Pedro de Rivadeneira and Juan de Mariana from the conventional opposing position of a state obligation to root out religious dissent. He argued in the Six livres that the Trial of the Knights Templar was an example of unjustified persecution similar to that of the Jews and medieval fraternities.

In 1588 Bodin completed in manuscript a Latin work Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis . It is a conversation about the nature of truth between seven educated men each with a distinct religious or philosophical orientation - a natural philosopher a Calvinist a Muslim a Roman Catholic a Lutheran a Jew and a skeptic. Because of this work Bodin is often identified as one of the first proponents of religious tolerance in the western world. Truth in Bodins view commanded universal agreement; and the Abrahamic religions agreed on the Old Testament .Vera religio would command loyalty to the point of death; his conception of it was influenced by Philo and Maimonides. His views on free will are also bound up with his studies in Jewish philosophy. Some modern scholars have contested his authorship of the text. The Colloquium of the Seven regarding the hidden secrets of the sublime things offers a peaceful discussion with seven representatives of various religions and worldviews who in the end agree on the fundamental underlying similarity of their beliefs.

Bodins theory as based in considerations of harmony resembles that of Sebastian Castellio. He has been seen as a scriptural relativist and deist with Montaigne and Pierre Charron; also in the group of learned Christian Hebraists with John Selden Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati and Gerhard Vossius. By reputation at least Bodin was cited as an unbeliever deist or atheist by Christian writers who associated him with perceived free-thinking and sceptical tradition of Machiavelli and Pietro Pomponazzi Lucilio Vanini Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza Pierre-Daniel HuetNathaniel FalckClaude-François Houtteville.Pierre Bayle attributed to Bodin a maxim about the intellectual consequences of the non-existence of God .Wilhelm Dilthey later wrote that the protagonists in the Colloquium anticipate those of Gotthold Ephraim Lessings Nathan der Weise.

The Colloquium was one of the major and most popular manuscripts in clandestine circulation in the early modern period with more than 100 copies catalogued. it had an extensive covert circulation after coming into intellectual fashion. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states It is curious that Leibniz who originally regarded the Colloquium as the work of a professed enemy of Christianity subsequently described it as a most valuable production. Its dissemination increased after 1700 even if its content was by then dated. It was interpreted in the 18th century as containing arguments for natural religion as if the views expressed by Toralba were Bodins; wrongly according to Rose whose reconstruction of Bodins religious views is a long way from belief in a detached deity.Grotius had a manuscript. Gottfried Leibniz who criticized the Colloquium to Jacob Thomasius and Hermann Conring some years later did editorial work on the manuscript. Henry Oldenburg wanted to copy it for transmission to John Milton and possibly John Dury or for some other connection in 1659. In 1662 Conring was seeking a copy for a princely library. It was not to be published in full until 1857 by Ludwig Noack from manuscripts collected by Heinrich Christian von Seckenberg.

Bodin was influenced by philosophic Judaism to believe in the annihilation of the wicked post exacta supplicia.

Bodin was a polymath concerned with universal history which he approached as a jurist. He belonged to an identifiable French school of antiquarian and cultural history with Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière Louis Le Caron Louis Le Roy Étienne Pasquier and Nicolas Vignier.

Historical disciples included Jacques Auguste de Thou and William Camden. The genre thus founded drawing social conclusions identified itself as civil history and was influenced particularly by Polybius. The Methodus has been called the first book to advance a theory of universal history based on a purely secular study of the growth of civilisation. Bodins secular attitude to history therefore goes some way to explain his perceived relationship to Machiavelli. While Bodins common ground with Machiavelli is not so large and indeed Bodin opposed the Godless vision of the world in Machiavelli they are often enough paired for example by A. C. Crombie as philosophical historians with contemporary concerns; Crombie also links Bodin with Francis Bacon as rational and critical historians. Both Bodin and Machiavelli treat religion as situated historically.

Bodin drew largely on Johann Boemus and also classical authors as well as accounts from Leo Africanus and Francisco Álvares. He showed little interest however in the New World. In terms of theories of cultural diffusion he influenced Nathanael Carpenter and many subsequently with his south-eastern origin theory of the transmission from peoples of the Middle East to Greece and Rome . Another follower was Peter Heylyn in his Microcosmus . In anthropology Bodin showed indications of polygenism as theory of human origins. In clearer terms on the other hand he believed that mankind was unifying the drivers being trade and the indications of the respublica mundana and international law as developing. This was within a scheme of Vaticinium Eliae or three periods of 2000 years for universal history to which he had little commitment though indicating its connection with the three climate regions and their predominance.

The south-eastern theory depended for its explanation on Bodins climate theory and astrology it was given in the Methodus and developed in Book VI of the Six Livres. He made an identification of peoples and geographical sectors with planetary influences in Book V of the Six Livres. His astrological theory is combined with the Hippocratic tradition; but not in the conventional way of Ptolemy. It has been suggested that he took them from a follower of Cardano Auger Ferrier.

Bodins conception of sovereignty was widely adopted in Europe. In a form simplified and adapted by others such as the French jurists Charles Loyseau and Cardin Le Bret it played an important role in the development of absolutism.

Influentially Bodin defended an orderly Gallican monarchy against Huguenots and any external interference. These general ideas became political orthodoxy in the reign of Henry IV of France tending to the beginnings of absolutism. Bodin had numerous followers as political theorist including Pierre Grégoire in whom with François Grimaudet legislative authority starts to become closer to the divine right of kings and William Barclay.Pierre Charron in La Sagesse of 1601 uses the idea of state from Bodin but with fewer limitations on royal power; Charron in this work argued for a secular neo-stoicism putting together ideas of Montaigne and Lipsius with those of Bodin. Charles Loyseau in the years 1608-10 published absolutist works with the emphasis on orderliness in society going much beyond Bodins writing of thirty years earlier a trend that continued into the 17th century.

As a demonologist his work was taken to be authoritative and based on experience as witch-hunting practitioner. As historian he was prominently cited by Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy in his 1713 Methode pour etudier lHistoire.Montesquieu read Bodin closely; the modern sociology hinted at in Bodin arising from the relationship between the state apparatus on the one hand and society on the other is developed in Montesquieu.

Bodins rejection of the Four Monarchies model was unpopular given the German investment in the Holy Roman Emperor as fourth monarch the attitude of Johannes Sleidanus. The need to accommodate the existing structure of the Empire with Bodin as theorist of sovereignty led to a controversy running over nearly half a century; starting with Henning Arnisaeus it continued unresolved to 1626 and the time of Christopher Besoldus. He drew a line under it by adopting the concept of composite polyarchy which held sway subsequently. Leibniz rejected Bodins view of sovereignty stating that it might amount only to territorial control and the consequence drawn by writers in Bodins tradition that federalism was chimeric.

Generally the English took great interest in the French Wars of Religion; their literature came into commonplace use in English political debate and Amyas Paulet made immediate efforts to find the Six livres for Edward Dyer. Shortly Bodins works were known in England to Philip Sidney Walter Ralegh and to Gabriel Harvey who reported they were fashionable in Oxford. His ideas on inflation were familiar by 1581. Somerville makes the point that not all those who discussed sovereignty in England at this period necessarily took their views from Bodin the ideas were in the air at the time and some such as Hadrian à Saravia and Christopher Lever had their own reasoning to similar conclusions.Richard Hooker had access to the works but doesnt reference them.John Donne cited Bodin in his Biathanatos.

Bodins view of parallelism of French and English monarchies was accepted by Ralegh.Roger Twysden dissented in his view the English monarchy had never fitted Bodins definition of sovereignty.Richard Beacon in Solon His Follie directed towards English colonisation in Ireland used text derived from the Six livres as well as much theory from Machiavelli; he also argued against Bodin that France was a mixed monarchy. Bodin influenced the controversial definitions of John Cowell in his 1607 book The Interpreter that caused a furore in Parliament during 1610.Edward Coke took from Bodin on sovereignty; and like him opposed the concept of mixed monarchy.

While Bodins ideas on authority fitted with the theory of divine right of kings his main concern was not with the choice of the sovereign. But that meant they could cut both ways being cited by parliamentarians as well as royalists. Henry Parker in 1642 asserted the sovereignty of Parliament by Bodinian reasoning.James Whitelocke used Bodins thought in discussing the King-in-Parliament. The royalist Robert Filmer borrowed largely from Bodin for the argument of his Patriarcha. John Locke in arguing decades later against Filmer in Two Treatises of Government didnt go behind his work to attack Bodin; but his ally James Tyrrell did as did Algernon Sidney. Another royalist user of Bodin was Michael Hudson. John Milton used Bodins theory in defending his anti-democratic plan for a Grand Council after Oliver Cromwells death.

Sir John Eliot summarized work of Arnisaeus as critic of Bodin and wrote in the Tower of London following Bodin that a lawful king as opposed to a tyrant will not do what he may do in his De iure majestatis.Robert Bruce Cotton quoted Bodin on the value of money;Robert Burton on politics in the Anatomy of Melancholy.

Richard Knolles in the introduction to his 1606 translation commended the book as written by a man experienced in public affairs.William Loe complained in preaching to Parliament in 1621 that Bodin with Lipsius and Machiavelli was too much studied to the neglect of Scripture.Richard Baxter on the other hand regarded the reading of Bodin Hugo Grotius and Francisco Suárez as a suitable training in politics for lawyers.

Bodins views on witchcraft were taken up in England by the witch-hunter Brian Darcy in the early 1580s who argued for burning rather than hanging as a method of execution and followed some of Bodins suggestions in interrogating Ursula Kemp. They were also radically opposed by Reginald Scott in his sceptical work Discoverie of Witchcraft . Later Francis Hutchinson was his detractor criticising his methodology.

In Italy Bodin was seen as a secular historian like Machiavelli. At the time of the Venetian Interdict Venetians agreed with the legislative definition of sovereignty. In particular Paolo Sarpi argued that Venices limited size in territorial terms was not the relevant point for the actions it could undertake on its own authority.

Later Giambattista Vico was to take Bodins cultural history approach noticeably further.

Works of Bodin were soon placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum for various reasons including discussion of Fortune and reason of state. The Methodus went on the Index in 1590;Robert Bellarmine as censor found it of some merit in its learning but the author to be a heretic or atheist critical of the papacy and much too sympathetic to Charles Du Moulin in particular. Other works followed in 1593. All his work was placed on the Index in 1628; the prohibition on the Theatrum continued into the 20th century. Venetian theologians were described as followers of Machiavelli and Bodin by Giovanni Amato.

Bellarmines Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in temporalibus reiterated against Bodins sovereignty theory an indirect form of the traditional papal deposing power to release subjects from the duty of obedience to tyrants.Jakob Keller in an apologetical work on behalf of limited justifications for tyrannicide treated Bodin as a serious opponent on the argument that subjects can only resist a tyrant passively with views on the Empire that were offensive.

On 1583 Bodin was placed on the Quiroga Index. Against tyrannicide Bodins thought was out of step of conventional thinking in Spain at the time. It was recognized in an unpublished dialogue imagined between Bodin and a jurist of Castile that the government of Spain was harder than that of France the other major European power because of the more complex structure of the kingdom.

Bodins view of witchcraft was hardly known in Spain until the 18th century."
Jean Bollack,"Jean Bollack was a French philosopher philologist and literary critic.

He first studied classical philology at the University of Basel among others with Peter von der Mühll and Albert Béguin and from 1945 at the University of Paris where he began working under the direction of Hellenist Pierre Chantraine.

He then established the Centre de recherche philologique in Lille which he ran for some years and to which his friend Heinz Wismann participated. According to Barbara Cassin his philological work is remarkable for its extraordinary textual vigilance.

In addition to his work as a Hellenist with his wife and collaborator Mayotte Bollack he has published studies on the poetry of Paul Celan. He is considered one of the most penetrating commentators on Celan."
Mayotte Bollack,Mayotte Bollack is a French professor of philology at the University of Lille Nord de France. She was the wife and close collaborator of Jean Bollack whose research interests she shared.
Louis de Bonald,"Louis Gabriel Ambroise Vicomte de Bonald was a French counter-revolutionaryphilosopher and politician. He is mainly remembered for developing a theoretical framework from which French sociology would emerge.

Bonald came from an ancient noble family of Provence. Louis was born in the chateau of Le Monna a modest estate that served as the family seat; the only son in his family Louis was heir to the family estate. Le Monna is situated just east of the market town of Millau overlooking the Dourbie river. His father Antoine Sébastien de Bonald died when Louis was four years old and the young boy would be brought up by his pious mother Anne née de Boyer du Bosc de Périe. Like many in the provincial nobility of the time Anne was influenced by the Jansenists and brought up her son with a stern Catholic piety. De Bonald was tutored at Le Monna until the age of eleven when he was sent to boarding school in Paris. He would then move to the Oratorian College of Juilly at age fifteen at the behest of his mother. The Oratorians were known for their rigor and grounded de Bonald in the classics as well as in mathematics philosophy and especially history. The headmaster of the school Father Mandar was a friend of Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and de Bonald was most likely acquainted with the writings of the philosophes early on.

He left Juilly in 1772 and entered the musketeers the following year. His unit was attached to King Louis XV at Versailles before being disbanded in 1776. After leaving the military de Bonald returned to his estates in his native region of Rouergue. He assumed the life of a country gentleman and took an interest in growing his properties and making them as productive as possible. He married a country nobleman Elisabeth-Marguerite de Guibal de Combescure and the two had seven children four of whom lived past childhood. One of their sons Louis Jacques Maurice de Bonald would go on to become the Cardinal-Archbishop of Lyon. His other son Victor would have a writing career of his own and would write a biography of his father.

He was elected to the town council of Millau in 1782 and was appointed mayor by the provinces royal governor in 1785. He was popular as mayor and after the introduction of election for local officials in 1789 rather than appointment he easily won reelection in February 1790. He was elected as a deputy to the departmental assembly later that year. De Bonald was at first supportive of the French Revolution and its initial decentralizing tendencies and hoped the nobility would recover powers lost during the centralization of the 17th century. He even lead the citizens of Millau in drafting a letter of congratulations to the National Assembly King Louis XVI and to finance minister Jacques Necker expressing the wish that this sacred title of citizen the spirit of concord and fraternity would lead to a new sense of solidarity. He managed to quell the Great Fear in his region and would earn the thanks of the National Assembly and he would be elected president of the departmental assembly soon after. However he soured on the Revolution with the enactment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in July 1790. Feeling unable to carry out the decrees of the Constitution in good conscience he resigned from his post in January 1791.

Fearing that his position as a former public official would make him the target of reprisals he emigrated with his two eldest sons leaving behind his wife mother and his remaining children in October 1791 and joined the army of the Prince of Condé. He was within earshot of the Battle of Jemappes in November 1792. He soon settled in Heidelberg and later moved to Switzerland. There he wrote his first important work the highly conservative Theorie du Pouvoir Politique et Religieux dans la Societe Civile Demontree par le Raisonnement et lHistoire which the Directory condemned. His exile would separate him from his family for more than a decade with only a brief reunion in 1797.

He returned to France in 1797 and largely spent the next five years in Paris in a sort of internal exile. Napoleon was an admirer of de Bonalds writings and had him removed from the list of proscribed émigrés in 1802. This amnesty granted de Bonald a greater degree of freedom to travel and publish his writings. He moved within literary and political circles and would make the acquittance of writers such as La Harpe Lacretelle and most importantly François-René de Chateaubriand. During this time he wrote a critical review of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith arguing that the true common good of a nation lies in a shared life of virtue and not simply in material prosperity. He would strike up a long correspondence and friendship with the conservative Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre however the two would never meet. In 1806 he along with Chateaubriand and Joseph Fiévée edited the Mercure de France. Two years later he was appointed counsellor of the Imperial University which he had often attacked previously.

The Bourbon Restoration saw de Bonalds political fortunes increase. He was made a member of the Royal Council for Public Instruction and in 1816 he was appointed to the French Academy by Louis XVIII. From 1815 to 1823 de Bonald served as an elected deputy for Aveyron in the Chamber of Deputies. A member of the Ultra-royalist faction his speeches were extremely conservative and he vigorously sought to undo the legislation passed in the wake of the Revolution. He opposed the Charter of 1814 seeing it as giving too many concessions to the revolutionaries and enfeebling the government. He sought strong protections for the traditional family and in 1815 successfully argued for the repeal of laws passed during the Revolution permitting divorce which afterwards remained illegal in France until 1884.

The Revolution had abolished the remainder of the medieval trade guilds affording little protection to workers. The Le Chapelier Law of 1791 forbade workers the right to form workers associations and prohibited strike actions. De Bonald worked to reverse the Le Chapelier Law and reintroduce guilds but his efforts were unsuccessful and the right to form workers associations would not be reintroduced in France until 1864.

He also continued his writing career during this time and his intellectual pursuits led to him visit many of Paris Salons. Both de Bonald and Chateaubriand frequented the salon of Juliette Récamier who drew from the leading literary and political circles of her day. He along with Chateaubriand contributed to various newspapers and journals including The Correspondant a journal of French and British thinkers as well as Conservateur a newspaper dedicated to defending the position of the Ultras. 1817 saw the publication of his Thoughts on Various Subjects and his Observations on Madame de Staëls Considerations on the Principle Events of the French Revolution in the following year.

In 1822 de Bonald was made Minister of State and in the following year he was raised to the peerage by Louis XVIII a dignity which he had lost by refusing to take the required oath in 1803. This entitled de Bonald to sit in the Chamber of Peers the upper house of the French Parliament during the Bourbon Restoration. In 1825 he argued strongly in favor of the Anti-Sacrilege Act including its prescription of the death penalty under certain conditions. In 1826 de Bonald briefly stepped away from politics due to the death of his wife.

In 1826 the Prime Minister and leader of the Ultras Joseph de Villèle introduced a bill reestablishing the law of primogeniture at least for owners of large estates unless they chose otherwise. The Revolution had radically changed inheritance law by mandating partitive inheritance where property is dispersed equally among heirs in order to break up aristocratic holdings. The proposed law was met with fierce opposition from the liberal Doctrinaires the press and even from Dissident Ultras such as Chateaubriand. De Bonalds On the Agricultural Family the Industrial Family and the Right of Primogeniture was written in defense of primogeniture agrarianism and the proposed law. The government tried to manage popular outrage by attempting to pass a bill in December of that year curtailing the press having largely withdrawn censorship in 1824. This only inflamed tensions and the proposed changes to inheritance were dropped by the government.

In 1827 Charles X created a commission on censorship and tasked de Bonald with presiding over it. This position would lead to the end of his long friendship with Chateaubriand who opposed literary censorship. De Bonalds own attitudes towards censorship were somewhat mixed; he was in favor of taking a hard line on books since objectionable material in this form would be harder to take out of circulation however he felt newspapers and periodicals should enjoy a greater degree of freedom. He felt that offending journalists and publishers should be first given a warning and then face legal prosecution if they continued to publish material detrimental to the public order. Bonald felt that the censorship practices of the 17th century would be anachronistic in the 19th century and that the best way to combat error would be through the marketplace of ideas. Bonald himself had voted against a proposed censorship law in 1817 as giving too much power to the government.

He retired from the Chamber of Peers in 1829. Following the July Revolution and the institution of the liberal July Monarchy in 1830 he retired from public life for good and spent the remainder of his days on his estate at Le Monna.

De Bonalds political philosophy rests on the assumptions of humanitys fallenness the need for strong government to repress mans evil tendencies and the belief that humans are inherently social creatures. He opposed the individualistic and atomistic tendencies of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. At the heart of his political thought was the idea that the family was the basis of society and that institutions should work to protect it in its traditional form. For this reason he opposed the secularization of marriage divorce and partitive inheritance. He was also critical of the Industrial Revolution because of its negative effects on traditional patterns of family life.

Bonald was also an early critic of laissez-faire economics. In 1806 he wrote a treatise critical of usury or the practice of lending at interest and in 1810 he wrote a critical review of the French edition of The Wealth of Nations. He was likewise critical of Louis XVIs finance minister Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot a physiocrat who liberalized Frances grain trade and supported the suppression of the trade guilds. Bonald criticised Turgot as a fanatical partisan of a materialistic politics. Elsewhere he says heat was not given to man to be an object of commerce but to nourish him. Shaped by Tacitus and his condemnations of Roman decadence Bonald felt that economic liberalism and unrestrained wealth would undermine the Christian character of the French people and would lead men to become less generous and more self-centered.

Bonald was one of the leading writers of the theocratic or traditionalist school which included de Maistre Lamennais Ballanche and baron Ferdinand dEckstein. The traditionalist school in reaction to the rationalists believed that human reason was incapable of even arriving at natural religion and that tradition the result of a primitive revelation was necessary to know both natural religion as well as the truths of supernatural revelation. De Bonald believed that the principles of good governance could be deduced from history and sacred scripture. His political thought is closely tied to his theory of the divine origin of language. Since man learns to speak through imitation he believed that the first man must have learned to speak from God who announced all moral principles to this first man. In his own words Lhomme pense sa parole avant de parler sa pensée ; the first language contained the essence of all truth. These moral truths were then codified in Holy Scripture. From this he deduces the existence of God the divine origin and consequent supreme authority of the Holy Scriptures and the infallibility of the Catholic Church.

While this thought lies at the root of all his speculations there is a formula of constant application. All relations may be stated as the triad of cause means and effect which he sees repeated throughout nature and society. Thus in the universe he finds the First Cause as mover movement as the means and bodies as the result; in the state power as the cause ministers as the means and subjects as the effects; in the family the same relation is exemplified by father mother and children; and in political society the monarch as cause ministersnobility as means and the subjects as effect. These three terms bear specific relations to one another; the first is to the second as the second to the third. Thus in the great triad of the religious worldGod the Mediator and ManGod is to the God-Man as the God-Man is to Man. On this basis he constructed a system of political absolutism. The sharing of power as in a democracy seemed ludicrous to de Bonald and the doctrine of the separation of powers tended towards anarchy. The monarch rules for the good of society and thus represents the general will contrary to Rousseau; whereas a multitude of individual wills even when united in purpose do not constitute the general will.

The ideas of the traditionalist school would be condemned by the Catholic Church in papal encyclicals such as Mirari vos and Singulari Nos. The conception of revelation advanced by the traditionalists would also be rejected at the First Vatican Council in the dogmatic constitution Dei Filius.

According to Bonald The Jews by their nature are a nation destined to remain alien to other peoples. This foreignness appearsthis seems the sense of the reference to the noirs to be an objective fact permanent and physical and for this reason analogous to the racial difference with the blacks.

Bonald called for the reversal of Jewish emancipation and endorsed new discriminatory measures

Bonalds writings exercised a great deal of influence over conservative and French Catholic thought throughout the 19th century. The French writer Honoré de Balzac considered himself to be an intellectual heir of Bonald and took up many Bonaldian themes in his writings once declaring that when it beheaded Louis XVI the Revolution beheaded in his person all fathers of families. Bonalds influence carried on throughout the counter-revolutionary tradition in the writings of Spanish conservative Juan Donoso Cortés and the ultramontane French journalist Louis Veuillot. His writings also exerted a great influence over the corporatist philosophical tradition through Frédéric le Play and René de La Tour du Pin and through them he had an influence on the development of the principle of solidarity in Catholic social thought. Bonalds direct influence fell into decline after World War I especially outside of French Catholic circles. Since then he has generally suffered neglect at the hands of economic historians and historians of Catholic thought. Bonalds thought has often drawn more positive attention from historians working within the Marxist or socialist tradition."
Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen,"Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen is a Professor of Comparative Literature and French at the University of Washington in Seattle and the author of many works on the history and philosophy of psychiatry psychoanalysis and hypnosis. Born to Danish parents he began his studies in France and emigrated to the United States in 1986. His constructivist analysis of the co-production of psychical facts emphasises the accuracy of historical accounts of mental disorders. 

Borch-Jacobsen is known for his positions in the controversies surrounding psychoanalysis especially with regard to the 2005 publication of Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse to which he was a major contributor. In a review of Borch-Jacobsens book Folies à plusieurs. De lhystérie à la dépression Pierre-Henri Castel calls him one of the most polemic thinkers with regard to the Freud Wars.

Borch-Jacobsen studied philosophy with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy two philosophers close in thought to and in dialogue with Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan.

In 1981 at the University of Strasbourg he submitted his doctoral dissertation on The Freudian Subject and then began teaching in the department of Psychoanalysis at Vincennes University in Paris where Jacques Lacan had first made his mark.

In 1983 Borch-Jacobsen participated in a meeting on the subject of hypnosis at the Hôpital Fernand-Widal where he joined such other as Léon Chertok René Girard and François Roustang in the discussion of hypnosis. The following year he published with Éric Michaud and Jean-Luc Nancy Hypnoses. In this book the authors consider the whole history of therapeutic hypnosis the psychological or sociological theory becoming suspect to dangerous regressions from intellectual ethical and political ideas.

On 21 January 1985 he presented a conference paper entitled Lhypnose dans la psychanalyse to the Society of Psychosomatic Medicine. The text of this paper was then published in collaboration with Chertok in 1987 with replies from many psychoanalysists philosophers and sociologists such as Georges Lapassade Octave Mannoni and Franklin Rausky.

In this paper Borch-Jacobsen presented evidence that psychoanalytic transference is a form of altered state of consciousness comparable with those that had existed in the work of psychotherapies which predate psychoanalysis from Shamanism to the hypnotism of the Nancy School by way of animal magnetism. He averred that le phénomène du transfert nest rien dautre de laveu même de Freud que le resurgissement au sein du dispositif analytique de la relation caractéristique du dispositif hypnotique dépendance soumission ou encore valorisation exclusive de la personne du médecin of hypnosis techniques dependence submission or again... exclusive worship of the doctor. He emphasised that there is consequently an important risk of suggestion on the part of the psychoanalyst even more so when the psychoanalyst himself is not conscious of these phenomena.

Borch-Jacobsen then reaffirmed that Sigmund Freud after having started to use the suggestive hypnotic psychotherapy of Hippolyte Bernheim in 1887 replaced it with the cathartic method in 1899 no longer using hypnosis as a means of direct suggestion but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients traumas. After practicing using free association in 1892 Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok Par opposition à lhypnose Freud avait cru fonder une psychothérapie scientifique destinée comme telle à devenir la psychothérapie par excellence. Linterprétation et la prise de conscience y constituaient le pivot de la cure. Laffectivité ne pouvait certes pas être éliminée de la nouvelle méthode mais elle se trouvait canalisée dans le transfert et par là dominée et mise au service de la connaissance. Telle était lambition du fondateur de la psychanalyse en cette fin de siècle encore toute imprégnée desprit positiviste . It is precisely this posture of Freuds that the consciousness is dominating that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen.

Bertrand Méheust rebuked Borch-Jacobsen for accepting without further discussion a dated view of hypnotherapy bequeathed by the positivist institutional medicine of the 19th century. Furthermore he argues that hypnosis follows a state of absolute passivity and therefore hurts well-being and that hypnosis is induced in someone in which all consciousness is disconnected a being totally immersed in the inner self indeed a puppet who thinks and lives totally by the workings of another. He takes sides with Puységur and Deleuze stating that lucid magnetic phenomena are assumed to establish a kind of synergy between the higher functions of intelligence and the immediacy of instinct.

In 1996 he completed a treatise on the case of Bertha Pappenheim Anna O. subtitled Une mystification centenaire in which according to Claude Meyer he met un terme à lun des mythes fondateurs de la psychanalyse . It is also the opinion of Elizabeth Loentz who had also written a book on Pappenheim and Paul Roazen who considers this work a major stage of university and historiographical work on psychoanalysis and a fly in the ointment of the defenders of the status quo."
Jean Borella,"Jean Borella is a Christian philosopher and theologian. Borellas works are deeply inspired by Ancient and Christian Neoplatonism but also by the Traditionalist School of René Guénon and Frithjof Schuon.

Borellas father who was Italian made a career in military aviation before his death in 1937 in an air crash when Jean was seven years old. Borellas mother was French from Lorraine. Borella had a Catholic education and traditional public school secondary studies which reinforced in him the idea that he would be a defender of the faith. By age 14 Borella understood Cartesian proof of the existence of God. In 1950 he stayed for a short while in a Benedictine monastery but left disappointed.

Borella attended university in Nancy France. Two of Borellas philosophy professors had significant influence on him Georges Vallin and Guy Bugault. Vallin French Orientalist and philosopher primarily taught the principles of Vedanta. Bugault taught the philosophy of Khâgne. While both Vallin and Bugault were readers of René Guénon they did not speak of Guénon in class or in private conversations with Borella. Borella graduated in 1953 with a degree in philosophy and in the same year became familiar with Guénon and then with Frithjof Schuon.

By 1957 Borella was a professor of philosophy in Gérardmer. In 1962 he became professor in Nancy France where he taught philosophy and French until 1977. In 1982 he was at the University of Paris X Nanterre.

Borella has three daughters the youngest of which is a Benedictine nun and four grandchildren."
Célestin Bouglé,"Célestin Charles Alfred Bouglé was a French philosopher known for his role as one of Émile Durkheims collaborators and a member of the LAnnée Sociologique.

Bouglé was born in Saint-Brieuc Côtes-du-Nord. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1890 and aggregated in philosophy in 1893. He was along with Xavier Léon Élie Halévy Léon Brunschvicg and Dominique Parodi one of the founding members of the journal Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale. In 1896 he joined with Durkheim and became one of the first editors of the Année Sociologique. He received his doctorate in 1899.

After teaching in Saint-Brieuc Montpellier and Toulouse he took a position at the Sorbonne in 1908 the same year that Essay on the Caste System appeared. He became the director of the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 until 1940. He died in Paris in 1940.

Bouglé was one of French anthropologist Louis Dumonts foremost inspirations when it came to seeing Indian castes not just as elements making up a whole but forming an ideological system that in meaning and scope surpasses the sum of the elements."
Francisque Bouillier,Francisque Bouillier was a French philosopher born in Lyons. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure Paris and in 1839 was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Lyons. From 1849 to 1864 he was dean of the faculty at Lyons and from 1867 to 1870 director of the École Normale Supérieure. His works include 
Nicolas Antoine Boulanger,"Nicolas Antoine Boulanger was a French philosopher and man of letters during the Age of Enlightenment.

Born the son of a paper merchant in Paris Boulanger studied first mathematics and later ancient languages. He composed several philosophical works in which he sought to come up with naturalistic explanations for superstitions and religious practices all of which were published posthumously. His major works were Research into the Origins of Oriental Despotism and Antiquity Unveiled . Boulangers collected works were published in 1792.

The German-born Baron dHolbach published his controversial anti-religious work Christianity Unveiled using Boulangers name as his pseudonym just two years after the philosophers death. Boulanger also was one of the first modern critics of Paul.

The Koronian asteroid 7346 Boulanger discovered in 1993 was named in his honor."
Pierre Bourdieu,"Pierre Bourdieu was a French sociologist and public intellectual. Bourdieus contributions to the sociology of education the theory of sociology and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields . During his academic career he was primarily associated with the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris and the Collège de France.

Bourdieus work was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order is maintained within and across generations. In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics. Building upon the theories of Martin Heidegger Ludwig Wittgenstein Maurice Merleau-Ponty Edmund Husserl Georges Canguilhem Karl Marx Charles Darwin Sigmund Freud Friedrich Nietzsche Gaston Bachelard Max Weber Émile Durkheim Claude Lévi-Strauss Erwin Panofsky and Marcel Mauss among others his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods and introduced such influential concepts as cultural social and symbolic forms of capital the cultural reproduction the habitus the field or location and symbolic violence. Another notable influence on Bourdieu was Blaise Pascal after whom Bourdieu titled his Pascalian Meditations.

Bourdieu was a prolific author producing hundreds of articles and three dozen books nearly all of which are now available in English. His best-known book is Distinction A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste in which he argues that judgments of taste are related to social position or more precisely are themselves acts of social positioning. The argument is put forward by an original combination of social theory and data from quantitative surveys photographs and interviews in an attempt to reconcile difficulties such as how to understand the subject within objective structures. In the process Bourdieu attempts to reconcile the influences of both external social structures and subjective experience on the individual. The book would go on to be named the sixth most important sociological work of the twentieth century by the International Sociological Association .

Pierre Bourdieus work emphasized how social classes especially the ruling and intellectual classes preserve their social privileges across generations despite the myth that contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility achieved through formal education.

Pierre Bourdieu was born in Denguin in southern France to a postal worker and his wife. The household spoke Béarnese a Gascon dialect. In 1962 Bourdieu married Marie-Claire Brizard and the couple would go on to have three sons Jérôme Emmanuel and Laurent.

Bourdieu was educated at the lycée in Pau before moving to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. From there he gained entrance to the École Normale Supérieure also in Paris where he studied philosophy alongside Louis Althusser. After getting his agrégation Bourdieu worked as a lycée teacher at Moulins for a year before his conscription into the French Army in 1955.

His biographers write that he chose not to enter the Reserve Officers College like many of his fellow ENS graduates as he wished to stay with people from his own modest social background. Deployed to Algeria in October 1955 during its war of independence from France Bourdieu served in a unit guarding military installations before being transferred to clerical work.

After his year-long military service Bourdieu stayed on as a lecturer in Algiers. During the Algerian War in 19581962 Bourdieu undertook ethnographic research into the clash through a study of the Kabyle peoples of the Berbers laying the groundwork for his anthropological reputation. The result was his first book Sociologie de lAlgérie which became an immediate success in France and was published in America in 1962. He later drew heavily on this fieldwork in his 1972 book Outline of a Theory of Practice a strong intervention into anthropological theory.

Bourdieu routinely sought to connect his theoretical ideas with empirical research and his work can be seen as sociology of culture or as he described it a Theory of Practice. His contributions to sociology were both evidential and theoretical . His key terms would be habitus capital and field.

He extended the idea of capital to categories such as social capital cultural capital financial capital and symbolic capital. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional social space; a person is not defined only by social class membership but by every single kind of capital he can articulate through social relations. That capital includes the value of social networks which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.

In 1960 Bourdieu returned to the University of Paris before gaining a teaching position at the University of Lille where he remained until 1964. From 1964 onwards Bourdieu held the position of Professor in the VIe section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études and from 1981 the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France . In 1968 Bourdieu took over the Centre de Sociologie Européenne founded by Aron which he directed until his death.

In 1975 with the research group he had formed at the Centre de Sociologie Européenne he launched the interdisciplinary journal Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales with which he sought to transform the accepted canons of sociological production while buttressing the scientific rigor of sociology. In 1993 he was honored with the Médaille dor du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique . In 1996 he received the Goffman Prize from the University of California Berkeley and in 2001 the Huxley Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Bourdieu died of cancer at the age of 71.

Much of Bourdieus work observes the role of educational and cultural resources in the expression of agency. Bourdieu was in practice both influenced by and sympathetic to the Marxist identification of economic command as a principal component of power and agency within capitalist society.

Bourdieus anthropological work was dominated by social hierarchy reproduction analysis. Bourdieu criticized the importance given to economic factors in the analysis of social order and change. He stressed instead that the capacity of actors to impose their cultural reproductions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of dominant social structures. Symbolic violence is the self-interested capacity to ensure that the arbitrariness of the social order is either ignored or argued as natural thereby justifying the legitimacy of existing social structures. This concept plays an essential part in his sociological analysis which emphasizes the importance of practices in the social world. Bourdieu was opposed to the intellectualist tradition and stressed that social domination and cultural reproduction were primarily focused on bodily know-how and competent practices in the society. Bourdieu fiercely opposed Rational Choice Theory because he believed it was a misunderstanding of how social agents operate.

Bourdieus work is influenced by much of traditional anthropology and sociology which he undertook to synthesize into his own theory. From Max Weber he retained an emphasis on the domination of symbolic systems in social life as well as the idea of social orders which would ultimately be transformed by Bourdieu from a sociology of religion into a theory of fields.

From Marx he gained his understanding of society as the ensemble of social relationships what exist in the social world are relations not interactions between agents or intersubjective ties between individuals but objective relations which exist independently of individual consciousness and will. and of the need to dialectically develop social theory from social practice. .

From Émile Durkheim through Marcel Mauss and Claude Lévi-Strauss Bourdieu inherited a certain structuralist interpretation of the tendency of social structures to reproduce themselves based on the analysis of symbolic structures and forms of classification. However Bourdieu critically diverged from Durkheim in emphasizing the role of the social agent in enacting through the embodiment of social structures symbolic orders. He furthermore emphasized that the reproduction of social structures does not operate according to a functionalist logic.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty and through him the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl played an essential part in the formulation of Bourdieus focus on the body action and practical dispositions .

Bourdieu was also influenced by Wittgenstein stating that Wittgenstein is probably the philosopher who has helped me most at moments of difficulty. Hes a kind of saviour for times of great intellectual distress. Bourdieus work is built upon an attempt to transcend a series of oppositions which he thought characterized the social sciences of his time. His concepts of habitus capital and field were conceived with the intention of overcoming such oppositions.

During the 1990s Bourdieu became more and more involved in political debate becoming one of the most important public faces of intellectual life in France. While a fierce critic of neoliberalism Bourdieu was also critical of the total intellectual role played by Jean-Paul Sartre and he dismissed Sartres attempts to intervene in French politics as irresponsible and opportunistic. Bourdieu saw sociology not as a form of intellectual entertainment but as a serious discipline of a scientific natureLa sociologie est un sport de combat his later career saw him enter the less academic world of political debate in France raising the issue of whether the sociologist has political responsibilities extending to the public domain.

Although Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre he had strong political views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By the time of his later work his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born from an urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate.

Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effectsparticularly the harmof neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study The Weight of the World although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles. The Weight of the World represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists it also shows Bourdieus collaborative character indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category of public intellectual.

Nevertheless Bourdieus activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage fulfilling his constructionist view of social life as it relied upon the idea of social actors making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very public action of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm. It is notable that in his later writings Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals describing them as like the Trojan Horse for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description public intellectual worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.

Bourdieu developed a theory of the action around the concept of habitus which exerted a considerable influence in the social sciences. This theory seeks to show that social agents develop strategies which are adapted to the structures of the social worlds that they inhabit. These strategies are unconscious and act on the level of a bodily logic.

In Bourdieus perspective each relatively autonomous field of modern life ultimately engenders a specific complex of social relations where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field. This disposition combined with every other disposition the individual develops through their engagement with other fields operating within the social world will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions i.e. habitus lasting acquired schemes of perception thought and action.

Habitus is somewhat reminiscent of some preexisting sociological concepts such as socialization though it also differs from the more classic concepts in several key ways. Most notably a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment habitus does not only or even primarily function at the level of explicit discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the muscle memory cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ballthe complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens concept of practical consciousness.

The concept of habitus was inspired by Marcel Mausss notion of body technique and hexis as well as Erwin Panofskys concept of intuitus. The word habitus itself can be found in the works of Mauss as well as of Norbert Elias Max Weber Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz as re-workings of the concept as it emerged in Aristotles notion of hexis which would become habitus through Thomas Aquinass Latin translation.

Though not deterministic the inculcation of the subjective structures of the habitus can be observed through statistical data for example while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains the continuity of the social order through time. As the individual habitus is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the persons life while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe it is not a perfect match.

Some examples of his empirical results include showing that despite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts peoples artistic preferences strongly tie in with their social position; and showing that subtleties of language such as accent grammar spelling and styleall part of cultural capitalare a major factor in social mobility .

Sociologists very often look at either social laws or the individual minds in which these laws are inscribed. Sociological arguments have raged between those who argue that the former should be sociologys principal interest and those who argue the same for the latter . When Bourdieu instead asks that dispositions be considered he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology asserting a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that the proper object of sociological analysis should be this middle ground dispositions.

According to Bourdieu agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. Rather social agents operate according to an implicit practical logica practical senseand bodily dispositions. Instead of confining his analysis of social relations and change to voluntaristic agency or strictly in terms of class as a structural relation Bourdieu uses the agency-structure bridging concept of field.

A field can be described as any historical non-homogeneous social-spatial arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. In simpler terms a field refers to any setting in which agents and their social positions are located. Accordingly the position of each particular agent in the field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field agents habitus and agents capital . Fields interact with each other and are hierarchical most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.

For Bourdieu social activity differences led to various relatively autonomous social spaces in which competition centers around particular capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basiswith economic power usually governingwherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.

Social agents act according to their feel for the game in which the feel roughly refers to the habitus and the game to the field.

Bourdieus most significant work on cultural production is available in two books The Field of Cultural Production and The Rules of Art . Bourdieu builds his theory of cultural production using his own characteristic theoretical vocabulary of habitus capital and field.

By cultural production Bourdieu intends a very broad understanding of culture in line with the tradition of classical sociology including science law and religion as well as expressive-aesthetic activities such as art literature and music. However his work on cultural production focuses overwhelmingly on two types of field or sub-field of cultural production literature and art.

According to Bourdieu the principal obstacle to a rigorous science of the production of the value of cultural goods is the charismatic ideology of creation which can be easily found in studies of art literature and other cultural fields. In Bourdieus opinion charismatic ideology directs the gaze towards the apparent producer and prevents us from asking who has created this creator and the magic power of transubstantiation with which the creator is endowed.

For Bourdieu a sociologically informed view of an artist ought to describe their relations to the field of production ; and their attitudes to their relations to the field of consumption . Further a work of literature for example may not adequately be analysed either as the product of the authors life and beliefs or without any reference to the authors intentions . In short the subject of a work is a habitus in relationship with a post a position that is within a field.

According to Bourdieu cultural revolutions are always dependent on the possibilities present in the positions inscribed in the field.

For Bourdieu habitus was essential in resolving a prominent antinomy of the human sciences objectivism and subjectivism.

As mentioned above Bourdieu used the methodological and theoretical concepts of habitus and field in order to make an epistemological break with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social phenomenology and structuralism. Habitus and field are proposed to do so.

The individual agent develops these dispositions in response to the objective conditions it encounters. In this way Bourdieu theorizes the inculcation of objective social structures into the subjective mental experience of agents. For the objective social field places requirements on its participants for membership so to speak within the field. Having thereby absorbed objective social structure into a personal set of cognitive and somatic dispositions and the subjective structures of action of the agent then being commensurate with the objective structures and extant exigencies of the social field a doxic relationship emerges.

Doxa refers to the learned fundamental deep-founded unconscious beliefs and values taken as self-evident universals that inform an agents actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus being congruous with the objective organization of the field tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may be thought of as a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective external structures and the subjective internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state the social world is perceived as natural taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.

Bourdieu thus sees habitus as an important factor contributing to social reproduction because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life. Individuals learn to want what conditions make possible for them and not to aspire to what is not available to them. The conditions in which the individual lives generate dispositions compatible with these conditions and in a sense pre-adapted to their demands. The most improbable practices are therefore excluded as unthinkable by a kind of immediate submission to order that inclines agents to make a virtue of necessity that is to refuse what is categorically denied and to will the inevitable.

Amongst any society of individuals the constant performance of dispositions trivial and grand forms an observable range of preferences and allegiances points and vectors. This spatial metaphor can be analysed by sociologists and realised in diagrammatic form. Ultimately conceptualising social relations this way gives rise to an image of society as a web of interrelated spaces. These are the social fields.

For Bourdieu habitus and field can only exist in relation to each other. Although a field is constituted by the various social agents participating in it a habitus in effect represents the transposition of objective structures of the field into the subjective structures of action and thought of the agent.

The relationship between habitus and field is twofold. First the field exists only insofar as social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata that are necessary to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly by participating in the field agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how that will allow them to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field and the field mediates between habitus and practice.

Bourdieu attempts to use the concepts of habitus and field to remove the division between the subjective and the objective. Bourdieu asserts that any research must be composed of two minutes wherein the first minute is an objective stage of researchwhere one looks at the relations of the social space and the structures of the field; while the second minute must be a subjective analysis of social agents dispositions to act and their categories of perception and understanding that result from their inhabiting the field. Proper research Bourdieu argues thus cannot do without these two together.

Bourdieu contended there is transcendental objectivity only when certain necessary historical conditions are met. The scientific field is precisely that field in which objectivity may be acquired. Bourdieus ideal scientific field is one that grants its participants an interest or investment in objectivity. Further this ideal scientific field is one in which the fields degree of autonomy advances and in a corresponding process its entrance fee becomes increasingly strict. The scientific field entails rigorous intersubjective scrutinizing of theory and data. This should make it difficult for those within the field to bring in for example political influence.

However the autonomy of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted. An important part of Bourdieus theory is that the historical development of a scientific field sufficiently autonomous to be described as such and to produce objective work is an achievement that requires continual reproduction. Having been achieved it cannot be assumed to be secure. Bourdieu does not discount the possibility that the scientific field may lose its autonomy and therefore deteriorate losing its defining characteristic as a producer of objective work. In this way the conditions of possibility for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.

Bourdieu insists on the importance of a reflexive sociology in which sociologists must at all times conduct their research with conscious attention to the effects of their own position their own set of internalized structures and how these are likely to distort or prejudice their objectivity. The sociologist according to Bourdieu must engage in a sociology of sociology so as not to unwittingly attribute to the object of observation the characteristics of the subject. They ought to conduct their research with one eye continually reflecting back upon their own habitus their dispositions learned through long social and institutional training.

It is only by maintaining such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot themselves in the act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is therefore a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages ; Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process Bourdieu chastises academics for judging their students work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register favouring students whose writing appears polished marking down those guilty of vulgarity. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks itnot because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.

Bourdieu also describes how the scholastic point of view unconsciously alters how scientists approach their objects of study. Because of the systematicity of their training and their mode of analysis they tend to exaggerate the systematicity of the things they study. This inclines them to see agents following clear rules where in fact they use less determinate strategies; it makes it hard to theorise the fuzzy logic of the social world its practical and therefore mutable nature poorly described by words like system structure and logic which imply mechanisms rigidity and omnipresence. The scholar can too easily find themselves mistaking the things of logic for the logic of thingsa phrase of Marxs which Bourdieu is fond of quoting. Again reflexivity is recommended as the key to discovering and correcting for such errors which would otherwise remain unseen mistakes produced by an over-application of the virtues that produced also the truths within which the errors are embedded.

Capital comes in 3 principal species economic cultural and social. A fourth species symbolic capital designates the effects of any form of capital when people do not perceive them as such.

Bourdieu developed theories of social stratification based on aesthetic taste in his 1979 work Distinction A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste published by Harvard University Press. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present ones social space to the worldones aesthetic dispositionsdepicts ones status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically Bourdieu hypothesizes that children internalize these dispositions at an early age and that such dispositions guide the young towards their appropriate social positions towards the behaviors that are suitable for them and foster an aversion towards other behaviors.

Bourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social economic and cultural capital. Society incorporates symbolic goods especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction. Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes.

The development of aesthetic dispositions are very largely determined by social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time. The acquisition of cultural capital depends heavily on total early imperceptible learning performed within the family from the earliest days of life. Bourdieu argues that in the main people inherit their cultural attitudes the accepted definitions that their elders offer them.

He asserts the primacy of social origin and cultural capital by claiming that social capital and economic capital though acquired cumulatively over time depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions.

According to Bourdieu tastes in food culture and presentation are indicators of class because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individuals place in society. Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. The multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction has its own artists and philosophers newspapers and critics just as it has its hairdresser interior decorator or tailor.

Thus different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences. These cognitive structuresare internalized embodied social structures becoming a natural entity to the individual. Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected resulting in disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance of the tastes of others.Bourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are

Indeed Bourdieu believes that the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in showing off a life-style . The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.

Children from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose heavy fatty fattening foods which are also cheap in their dinner layouts opting for plentiful and good meals as opposed to foods that are original and exotic. These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieus ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy that contrasts the convivial indulgence characteristic of the lower classes. Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.

The degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. Demonstrably at equivalent levels of educational capital social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes ones social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also across the divisions of labor economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending. This observation reinforces the idea that social origin more than economic capital produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability consumption patterns remain stable.

Bourdieu sees symbolic capital as a crucial source of power.Symbolic capital is any species of capital that is in Loïc Wacquants terms not perceived as such but which is instead perceived through socially inculcated classificatory schemes. When a holder of symbolic capital uses the power this confers against an agent who holds less and seeks thereby to alter their actions they exercise symbolic violence.

Symbolic violence is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just. It is the incorporation of unconscious structures that tend to perpetuate the structures of action of the dominant. The dominated then take their position to be right. Symbolic violence is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals and imposes the spectre of legitimacy of the social order.

In his theoretical writings Bourdieu employs some terminology used in economics to analyze the processes of social and cultural reproduction of how the various forms of capital tend to transfer from one generation to the next. For Bourdieu formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success according to Bourdieu entails a whole range of cultural behaviour extending to ostensibly non-academic features like gait dress or accent. Privileged children have learned this behaviour as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers expectations with apparent ease; they are docile. The unprivileged are found to be difficult to present challenges. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this ease or natural abilitydistinctionas in fact the product of a great social labour largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents class position in the wider social system.

Cultural capital refers to assets e.g. competencies skills qualifications which enable holders to mobilise cultural authority and can also be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example working class children can come to see the educational success of their middle-class peers as always legitimate seeing what is often class-based inequality as instead the result of hard work or even natural ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of peoples symbolic or economic inheritance into cultural capital .

Bourdieu argues that cultural capital has developed in opposition to economic capital. Moreover the conflict between those who mostly hold cultural capital and those who mostly hold economic capital finds expression in the opposed social fields of art and business. The field of art and related cultural fields are seen to have striven historically for autonomy which in different times and places has been more or less achieved. The autonomous field of art is summed up as an economic world turned upside down highlighting the opposition between economic and cultural capital.

For Bourdieu social capital is the sum of the resources actual or virtual that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition. In order for individuals to gain such capital they must work for it constantly and it takes time according to Bourdieu. For some families cultural capital is accumulated over a period of generations as they adopt cultural investment strategies and pass them on to their children. This gives children an opportunity to realize their potential through education and they pass on those same values to their children. Over time individuals in such families gain cultural currency which gives them an inherent advantage over other groups of people which is why there is such variation in academic achievement in children of different social classes. Having such cultural currency enables people to compensate for a lack of financial capital by giving them a certain level of respect and status in society. Bourdieu believes that cultural capital may play a role when individuals pursue power and status in society through politics or other means. Social and cultural capital along with economic capital contribute to the inequality we see in the world according to Bourdieus argument.

Bourdieu takes language to be not merely a method of communication but also a mechanism of power. The language one uses is designated by ones relational position in a field or social space. Different uses of language tend to reiterate the respective positions of each participant. Linguistic interactions are manifestations of the participants respective positions in social space and categories of understanding and thus tend to reproduce the objective structures of the social field. This determines who has a right to be listened to to interrupt to ask questions and to lecture and to what degree.

The representation of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language dialect and accent. For example the use of different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. A good example of this would be in the case of French. Until the French Revolution the differences in dialect directly reflected a persons presumed social status. Peasants and the lower classes spoke local dialects while only nobles and the upper classes were fluent in the official French language. Accents can reflect an areas inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.

The reason language acts as a mechanism of power is through forms of mental representations it is acknowledged and noticed as objective representations as a sign andor symbol. These signs and symbols therefore transform language into an agency of power.

Bourdieu was for many the leading intellectual of present-day Francea thinker in the same rank as Foucault Barthes and Lacan. His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities. They have also been used in pedagogy. Several works of his are considered classics not only in sociology but also in anthropology education and cultural studies. Distinction A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste was named as one of the 20th centurys ten most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association.The Rules of Art has significantly affected sociology history literature and aesthetics.

In France Bourdieu was seen not as an ivory tower academic or cloistered don but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001 a documentary film about BourdieuSociology is a Martial Artbecame an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed how much of a politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was taking on the mantle of Émile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what people like him should do.

For Bourdieu sociology was a combative effort that sought to expose the un-thought structures that lie beneath the physical and thought practices of social agents. He saw sociology as a means of confronting symbolic violence and of exposing those unseen areas in which one could be free.

Bourdieus work continues to be influential. His work is widely cited and many sociologists and other social scientists work explicitly in a Bourdieusian framework. One example is Loïc Wacquant who persistently applies the Bourdieusian theoretical and methodological principles to subjects such as boxing employing what Bourdieu termed participant objectivation or what Wacquant calls carnal sociology. In addition to publishing a book on Bourdieus lasting influence novelist Édouard Louis uses the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu as a literary device.

Bourdieu also played a crucial role in the popularisation of correspondence analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are like his sociology inherently relational. I use Correspondence Analysis very much because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that thinks in relations as I try to do it with the concept of field Bourdieu said in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.

Dominique Bourg,"Dominique Bourg is a French philosopher. Since 2006 he is professor at the Faculty of Geosciences and Environment of the University of Lausanne .

He has two doctorates and is a specialist of the environment global changes and sustainable development. He published many articles and books and participated in various committees related to the environment.

Dominique Bourg co-directed La pensée écologique. Une anthologie with Antoine Fragnière and the Dictionnaire de la pensée écologique with Alain Papaux . He analyses that Ecological thinking is characterised by a critique of modernity a scepticism about the possibility of solving environmental problems through technology and a questioning of the separation between humans and nature.

According to Bourg the root of the global problem is the flow of materials and energy . He also thinks that over the last decades economic growth increased wealth concentration and economic inequality while accelerating the destruction of natural resources and ecosystems but without fulfilling its promise to provide more jobs or make people happier.

Dominique Bourg was part of the Coppens commission who prepared the French Charter for the Environment of 2004."
Pierre Boutang,"Pierre Boutang was a French philosopher poet and translator. He was also a political journalist associated with the currents of Maurrasianism and Royalism.

Boutang was an alumnus of the Ecole Normale Supérieure and agrégé de philosophie in 1936 he participated that year in editing Action Française and showed fervent support for the ideas of Charles Maurras. He was a member of Girauds government in North Africa in 1943 and enlisted in the French colonial army serving in Tunisia and Morocco. He was discharged without pension and prohibited from teaching. Thereafter he took up journalism collaborating on Aspects de la France where his articles from a royalist viewpoint showed obvious antisemitism. He was a regular contributor to Bulletin de Paris where using a pseudonym he reviewed plays.

Seeking to renew royalism in alignment with Christianity with his friend Michel Vivier he founded the weekly La Nation Française in 1955 to which Les Hussards and also Marcel Aymé Gustave Thibon and Armand Robin contributed. He wanted to create a Sartre shelter that also functioned against the adherents of nihilism. He veered between supporting Charles de Gaulle and opposing him insisting notably on the monarchical model on which in his view the constitution of the Cinquième République rested. Though he denounced the terror for which the FLN was responsible Boutang refused to support the OAS. From the 1970s his political declarations became rarer but he showed a firm loyalty to the Comte de Paris.

After representations by Edmond Michelet Alain Peyrefitte and others Boutang was allowed to teach by President de Gaulle in 1967. He taught philosophy at the Lycée Turgot and then became a lecturer at the University of Brest in 1974. Finally he was appointed Professeur of Metaphysics at the Sorbonne where he taught until 1984 continuing his seminars at his home in Saint-Germain-en-Laye until the end of his life. He died on 27 June 1998."
Émile Boutroux,"His first employment was the post of philosophy professor at the lycée in Caen. In 1874 he published his book on which he based his doctoral thesis. The Contingency of the laws of the nature was an analysis of the implications of Kantian philosophy for science.

Between 1874 and 1876 Boutroux taught at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Nancy and while there he fell in love with and married Aline Poincaré the sister of the scientist and mathematician Henri Poincaré. In 1880 his son Pierre was born. Pierre Boutroux was himself to become a distinguished mathematician and historian of science.

In 1888 Boutroux was made professor of history of modern philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris.

He was elected a member of Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1902 he became Director of the Thiers Foundation a residency for Frances brightest students. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1912."
Jacques Bouveresse,"Jacques Bouveresse was a philosopher who wrote on subjects including Ludwig Wittgenstein Robert Musil Karl Kraus philosophy of science epistemology philosophy of mathematics and analytical philosophy. Bouveresse was called an avis rara among the better known French philosophers in his championing of critical standards of thought.

He was Professor Emeritus at the Collège de France where until 2010 he held the chair of philosophy of language and epistemology. His disciple Claudine Tiercelin was appointed to a chair of metaphysics and philosophy of knowledge upon his retirement.

Born on 20 August 1940 in Épenoy in the Doubs département of France into a farming family Jacques Bouveresse completed his secondary education at the seminary of Besançon. He spent two years of preparation for the baccalauréat in philosophy and scholastic theology at Faverney in Haute-Saône. He followed his preparatory literary classes at the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux and in 1961 entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.

He presented his doctoral thesis in philosophy on Wittgenstein entitled Le mythe de lintériorité. Expérience signification et langage privé chez Wittgenstein.

Beginning with his earliest works he consistently constructed his own philosophical and intellectual path without following the normal routes and modes of academia. In 1976 Wittgenstein was practically unknown in France as were Musil and the logic and analytical philosophy which Bouveresse had begun to study in the 1960s.These two last domains notably propelled him towards the lectures of Jules Vuillemin and Gilles Gaston Granger who at the time were practically alone in occupying themselves with these problems and with whom he maintained a lasting friendship.

Bouveresses philosophy is a continuation of the intellectual and philosophical tradition of central Europe . His philosophical programme is in nearly all respects similar to the one conducted by many present day Analytic philosophers.

Jacques Bouveresse is interested in the thought of the early 20th-century Austrian novelist Robert Musil famous for his novel The Man Without Qualities as well as the aversionfascination with which Paul Valéry regarded philosophy.

Apart from his work on Ludwig Wittgenstein Jacques Bouveresse is interested in the incompleteness theorems of Kurt Gödel and their philosophical consequences. It is on this account that he has attacked in a popular work Prodiges et vertiges de lanalogie the use made of these theorems by Régis Debray. Bouveresse denounces the literary distortion of a scientific concept for the purpose of a thesis. This distortion according to him has no other purpose than to overwhelm a readership which lacks the training necessary to comprehend such complex theorems. Bouveresses reproach to Debray is not that he uses a scientific concept for the purpose of an analogy but that he uses such a difficult to understand theorem in the attempt to provide an absolute justification in the form of the classic sophism of the argument from authority.

According to Bouveresse the incompleteness of a formal system which applies to certain mathematical systems in no way implies the incompleteness of sociology which is not a formal system."
Charles de Bovelles,"Charles de Bovelles was a French mathematician and philosopher and canon of Noyon. His Géométrie en françoys was the first scientific work to be printed in French.

Bovelles authored a number of philological theological and mystical treatises and has been reckoned to be perhaps the most remarkable French thinker of the 16th century.

Joseph Victor has written the best intellectual biography of Charles de Bovelles but got the date of his death wrong.

He studied arithmetic under Jacques Lefèvre dÉtaples. His contemporaries knew him as widely travelled in Europe. It is known that he made a rebus for the year of the building of the hôtel de ville in Saint-Quentin. He gave a stained glass window in the town in 1521. In 1547 in the preface of La Geometrie practique Bovelles acknowledges help from Oronce Fine with the engravings.

Maupin assigned dates 1470-1553 which confused many people subsequently. S. Musial in a careful study published in the Actes of the 500th centennial of his birth in Noyon in 1979 fixes the date of his death at 1567 .

His first major work Quæ in hoc volumine a collection of 12 works by Bovelles that constitute a major but still little recognized contribution to the philosophical thought of the Renaissance. Of these 12 works the Liber de Sapiente is certainly the most significant serving to summarize and synthesize the ideas presented in the other short treatises. In fact the Liber de Sapiente is the only part of In Hoc Volumine that has had a modern edition having been translated once into Italian and twice into French. And yet this work still has no English translation. The Liber de sapiente is important to intellectual history because it exemplifies the transition between Medieval and Renaissance thinking. Ernst Cassirer considered the Liber de Sapiente perhaps the most curious and in some respects the most characteristic creation of Renaissance philosophy in no other work can we find such an intimate union of old and new ideas. . Cassirer even included a critical Latin edition of the de Sapiente prepared by his student as an appendix to The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy.

In geometry Bovelles was a Pythagorean objects and living beings take up regular shapes. Some of his chapters on bells physiognomy machines are representative of the period.

Michel Chasles in his Aperçu historique... des méthodes en géométrie points out Bovelles for his work on star polyhedra a successor in this of Thomas Bradwardine.

His 1533 work Agonologiae Jesu Christi libri quatuor has been cited in art history. For example John North The Ambassadors Secret refers to it in interpreting Holbeins picture The Ambassadors."
Rémi Brague,"Rémi Brague is a French historian of philosophy specializing in the Arabic Jewish and Christian thought of the Middle Ages. He is professor emeritus of Arabic and religious philosophy at the Sorbonne and Romano Guardini chair of philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

Educated primarily at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris Brague began his career as a student of Greek philosophy interpreted in a distinctly modern key. His doctoral thesis later published as Aristote et la question du monde Essai sur le contexte cosmologique et anthropologique de lontologie developed a phenomenological account of Aristotles conception of the world. In particular his goal was to write the book on Aristotle that Heidegger would have written had he not written Being and Time. From there he was led to study Hebrew in order to read the Old Testament and Arabic in order to read the Jewish philosopher Maimonides The Guide for the Perplexed in its original language. Since then most of his work has taken place at the intersection of the three Abrahamic religions as they developed out of the ancient world formed themselves in dialogue with one another and eventually gave rise to modernity. He is the author of numerous books on classical and medieval intellectual history religion national identity literature and law and is perhaps best known in the English-speaking world for his book Europe la voie romaine translated into English as Eccentric Culture A Theory of Western Civilization . His masterwork thus far is his trilogy on the philosophical development of law in the West La Sagesse du monde Histoire de lexpérience humaine de lunivers La Loi de Dieu. Histoire philosophique dune alliance and Le Règne de lhomme Genèse et échec du projet moderne . All have been translated into English as The Wisdom of the World The Human Experience of the Universe in Western Thought The Law of God The Philosophical History of an Idea and The Kingdom of Man Genesis and Failure of the Modern Project .

While his intellectual influences are various Brague has developed some of the chief points of his unique account of Western intellectual history in dialogue with the controversial political theorist Leo Strauss. Brague has said that Leo Strauss taught me that when reading a text you must be open to the possibility that it contains different layers of meaning. All philosophical books written before the Enlightenment aim at both a wider audience and a small elite able to understand the deeper meaning of the texts. This approach informed Bragues understanding of Maimonides and the medieval Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi among others but he declared himself unconvinced that it applies to the Greek philosophers in the way Strauss has taught. Brague holds that Strauss became so convinced of his own way of interpreting texts that he came to apply it to all sorts of books even Cervantes Don Quixote. Strauss taught me to read very carefully. But I dont consider myself a Straussian nor do the real Straussians consider me as one of them. Arguably Bragues Roman view of Western Intellectual History forms a kind of response to Strauss famous emphasis on the longstanding tension between Athens and Jerusalem. For Brague we cannot understand this tension correctly without understanding the historic mediation of both Athens and Jerusalem through Rome. Likewise Bragues account of Divine Law in the Western intellectual tradition reframes the relationship between faith and reason the secular and the sacred in response to Strauss recurrent emphasis on the Theological-Political Problem.

Brague is the recipient of numerous awards including honors by both the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 2009 he received both the Josef Pieper Prize and the Grand prix de philosophie de lAcadémie française and he was awarded the 2012 Ratzinger Prize for Theology alongside Brian E. Daley. In 2013 he was named a Chevalier de lOrdre National de la Légion dhonneur.

Christine Buci-Glucksmann,"Christine Buci-Glucksmann is a French philosopher and Professor Emeritus from University of Paris VIII specializing in the aesthetics of the Baroque and Japan and computer art. Her best-known work in English is Baroque Reason The Aesthetics of Modernity.

Christine Buci-Glucksmann began her career as a philosopher in the 1970s with studies of Friedrich Engels and Antonio Gramsci. She followed this research into aesthetics based primarily around the works of Walter Benjamin. From this foundation she researched the aesthetics of the perception of the Baroque which was published as La Raison baroque in 1984 and with La folie du voir in 1986.

Claude Buffier,"Claude Buffier French philosopher historian and teacher was born in Poland of French parents who returned to France and settled in Rouen soon after his birth.

He was educated at the Jesuit college there and he was received into the Order at the age of nineteen. A dispute with the archbishop compelled him to leave Rouen. After a short stay in Rome he returned to Paris to the college of the Jesuits where he spent the rest of his life. He seems to have been a good teacher and lucid expositor.

His goal in the Traité des premières vérités his best-known work was to discover the ultimate principle of knowledge. This he found in the sense we have of our own existence and of what we feel within ourselves He thus took substantially the same ground as Descartes but he rejected the a priori method. In order to know what exists distinct from the self common sense is necessary. Common sense he defined as that disposition which nature has placed in all or most men in order to enable them when they have arrived at the age and use of reason to form a common and uniform judgment with respect to objects different from the internal sentiment of their own perception which judgment is not the consequence of any anterior judgment.

The truths which this disposition of nature obliges us to accept can be neither proved nor disproved; they are practically followed even by those who reject them speculatively. But Buffier did not claim for these truths of common sense the absolute certainty which characterizes the knowledge we have of our own existence or the logical deductions we make from our thoughts; they possess merely the highest probability and the man who rejects them is to be considered a fool though he is not guilty of a contradiction.

Buffiers aversion to scholastic refinements gives to his writings an appearance of shallowness and want of metaphysical insight and unquestionably he failed entirely even to indicate the nature of that universality and necessity which he ascribed to his eternal verities; he was however one of the earliest to recognize the psychological as distinguished from the metaphysical side of Descartess principle and to use it with no inconsiderable skill as the basis of an analysis of the human mind similar to that enjoined by Locke. In this he has anticipated Thomas Reid and the Scottish school. Voltaire described him as the only Jesuit who has given a reasonable system of philosophy.

He also wrote Elémens de métaphysique Suite de la Grammaire française sur un plan nouveau and a number of historical essays. Most of his works appeared in a collected form in 1732 and an English translation of the Traité was published in 1780."
Jean Buridan,"Jean Buridan was an influential 14th century French philosopher.

Buridan was a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris for his entire career focusing in particular on logic and the works of Aristotle. Buridan sowed the seeds of the Copernican revolution in Europe. He developed the concept of impetus the first step toward the modern concept of inertia and an important development in the history of medieval science. His name is most familiar through the thought experiment known as Buridans ass; however this thought experiment does not appear in his extant writings.

Buridan was born sometime before 1301 perhaps at or near the town of Béthune in Picardy France or perhaps elsewhere in the diocese of Arras. He received his education in Paris first at the Collège du Cardinal Lemoine and then at the University of Paris receiving his Master of Arts degree and formal license to teach at the latter by the mid-1320s.

Unusually he spent his entire academic life in the faculty of arts rather than obtaining the doctorate in law medicine or theology that typically prepared the way for a career in philosophy. Also unusual for a philosopher of his time Buridan further maintained his intellectual independence by remaining a secular cleric rather than joining a religious order. A papal letter of 1330 refers to him as simply clericus Atrebatensis diocoesis magister in artibus . As university statutes permitted only those educated in theology to teach or write on the subject there are no writings from Buridan on either theological matters or commentary of Peter Lombards Sentences.

Speculation on his reasons for avoiding religious matters have remained uncertain. Most scholars think it is unlikely that he went unnoticed given his philosophical talents. As well it is unlikely that he could not afford to study theology given that he received several bursaries and stipends. Indeed he is listed in a document from 1350 as being among the teachers capable of supporting themselves without the need for financial assistance from the University. Zupko has speculated that Buridan deliberately chose to remain among the artists possibly envisioning philosophy as a secular enterprise based on what is evident to both the senses and the intellect rather than the non-evident truths of theology revealed through scripture and doctrine.

The last appearance of Buridan in historical documents came in 1359 where he was mentioned as the adjudicator in a territorial dispute between the English and Picard nations. It is supposed that he died sometime after then since one of his benefices was awarded to another person in 1362.

The bishop Albert of Saxony himself renowned as a logician was among the most notable of his students.

An ordinance of Louis XI of France in 1473 directed against the nominalists prohibited the reading of his works.

Where is the very wise HeloiseFor whom was castrated and then a monkPierre Esbaillart in Saint-DenisFor his love he suffered this sentence.Similarly where is the Queen Who ordered that BuridanWere thrown in a sack into the SeineOh where are the snows of yesteryear

François Villon Ballade des dames du temps jadis 916

Apocryphal stories abound about his reputed amorous affairs and adventures which are enough to show that he enjoyed a reputation as a glamorous and mysterious figure in Paris life. None of the stories can be confirmed and most contradict known historical information.

Some rumors hold that he died when the King of France had him put in a sack and thrown into the River Seine after his affair with the Queen came to light. François Villon alludes to this in his famous poem Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis. Others suggest that he was expelled from Paris due to his nominalist teachings and moved to Vienna to found the University of Vienna. Another story talks of him hitting Pope Clement VI with a shoe.

The concept of inertia was alien to the physics of Aristotle. Aristotle and his peripatetic followers held that a body was maintained in motion only by the action of a continuous external force. Thus in the Aristotelian view a projectile moving through the air would owe its continuing motion to eddies or vibrations in the surrounding medium a phenomenon known as antiperistasis. In the absence of a proximate force the body would come to rest almost immediately.

The theory of impetus proposed that motion was maintained by some property of the body imparted when it was set in motion. Buridan was the first to name this motion-maintaining property impetus but the theory itself probably did not originate with him. A less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in the Avicennas doctrine of mayl . In this he was possibly influenced by John Philoponus who was developing the Stoic notion of hormé . The major difference between Buridans theory and that of his predecessor is that he rejected the view that the impetus dissipated spontaneously instead asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus. Buridan further held that the impetus of a body increased with the speed with which it was set in motion and with its quantity of matter. This is closely related to the modern concept of momentum. Buridan saw impetus as causing the motion of the object

Buridan also contended that impetus is a variable quality whose force is determined by the speed and quantity of the matter in the subject. In this way the acceleration of a falling body could be understood in terms of its gradual accumulation of units of impetus.

Because of his developments historians of science Pierre Duhem and Anneliese Maier both saw Buridan as playing an important role in the demise of Aristotelian cosmology. Duhem even called Buridan the forerunner of Galileo. Zupko has disagreed pointing out that Buridan did not use his theory to transform the science of mechanics but instead remained a committed Aristotelian in thinking that motion and rest are contrary states and that the universe is finite in extent."
Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis,"Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis was a French physiologist freemason and materialist philosopher.

Cabanis was born at Cosnac the son of Jean Baptiste Cabanis a lawyer and agronomist. At the age of ten he attended the college of Brives where he showed great aptitude for study but his independence of spirit was so great that he was almost constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers and was finally expelled. He was then taken to Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion for two years. From 1773 to 1775 he travelled in Poland and Germany and on his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry. About this time he sent to the Académie française a translation of the passage from Homer proposed for their prize and though he did not win he received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating the whole of the Iliad.

At his fathers wish he gave up writing and decided to engage in a more settled profession selecting medicine. In 1789 his Observations sur les hôpitaux procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in Paris and in 1795 he became professor of hygiene at the medical school of Paris a post which he exchanged for the chair of legal medicine and the history of medicine in 1799.

Partly because of his poor health he tended not to practise as a physician his interests lying in the deeper problems of medical and physiological science. During the last two years of Honoré Mirabeaus life Cabanis was intimately connected with him and wrote the four papers on public education which were found among the Mirabeaus papers at his death and were edited by the real author soon afterwards in 1791. During the illness which terminated his life Mirabeau trusted entirely to Cabanis professional skills. Of the death of Mirabeau Cabanis drew up a detailed narrative intended as a justification of his treatment of the case. He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and then of the conservative senate and the dissolution of the Directory was the result of a motion which he made to that effect. His political career was brief. He was one of the Council of Five Hundred and afterwards was a member of the Senate. Hostile to the policy of Napoleon Bonaparte he rejected every offer of a place under his government. He died at Meulan.

His body is buried in the Pantheon and his heart in Auteuil Cemetery in Paris.

A complete edition of Cabaniss works was begun in 1825 and five volumes were published. His principal work Rapports du physique et du moral de lhomme consists in part of memoirs read in 1796 and 1797 to the institute and is a sketch of physiological psychology. Psychology is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology for sensibility the fundamental fact is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility and sensibility itself is a property of the nervous system. The soul is not an entity but a faculty; thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive food and digest it so the brain receives impressions digests them and has as its organic secretion thought.

Alongside this materialism Cabanis held another principle. He belonged in biology to the vitalistic school of GE Stahl and in the posthumous work Lettre sur les causes premières the consequences of this opinion became clear. Life is something added to the organism over and above the universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to which we give the name of Nature. It is impossible to avoid ascribing both intelligence and will to this power. This living power constitutes the ego which is truly immaterial and immortal. Cabanis did not think that these results were out of harmony with his earlier theory.

His work was highly appreciated by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer who called his work excellent.

He was a member of the masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs from 1778. In 1786 Cabanis was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

Cabanis was an early proponent of evolution. In the Encyclopedia of Philosophy it is stated that he believed in spontaneous generation. Species have evolved through chance mutations and planned mutation which change the structures of heredity.

He influenced the work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who referred to Cabanis in his Philosophie Zoologique. Cabanis was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characteristics; he also developed his own theory of instinct.

Cabanis made a statement that recognized a basic understanding of natural selection. Historian Martin S. Staum has written that

In a simple statement of adaptation and selection theory Cabanis argued that species that have escaped extinction have had successively to bend and conform to sequences of circumstances from which apparently were born in each particular circumstance other entirely new species better adjusted to the new order of things."
Jean-Yves Calvez,"Jean-Yves Calvez was a French Jesuit theologian philosopher economist expert in Marxism and professor of social philosophy.

At age 16 Calvez became a novitiate of the Society of Jesus on October 23 1943. Following his religious training he completed brilliant studies at the institute of political science and the institute of international law in Paris. He also earned a degree from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. From 1953 he taught social sciences at the Jesuit academy of Chantilly. On July 31 1957 he was ordained as a Catholic priest.

Jean-Yves Calvez was not yet a priest in 1956 when he published a work that rapidly gained attention in the field of social philosophy The Thought of Karl Marx . To be interested in Marxism before the Second Vatican Council and to reveal a certain sympathy for Karl Marx was daring. However the objectivity and depth of his work avoiding the polemic and Communist party thinking that often attached themselves to Marxs personality immediately gained him great esteem in the field of social philosophy. The Thought of Karl Marx has been published in many editions and is still a reference book today.

A polyglot Calvez was very interested in social economic and political questions refusing to separate these three fields of study but rather tying them together in research serving a Christian vision of the whole human being. Such was his engagement as a Jesuit priest in the Catholic Church. Calvez studied and promoted a Catholic social teaching that was less Euro-centric and more oriented toward the grave problems of underdevelopment that accompanied the wave of botched decolonizations of the 1960s.

Calvez was a teacher of philosophy and social sciences in the Jesuit faculty of philosophy in Chantilly and he was the director of the center of popular action . He participated in 1962 in the foundation of a socio-economic research center the African Institute for Economic and Social Development later known as the Center for Research and Action for Peace in Abidjan. He traveled a lot particularly in Latin America where he was close to liberation theologists with whom he would maintain strong links of esteem and friendship for the rest of his life.

In 1967 Calvez was named provincial superior and tasked with uniting the four Jesuit provinces of France. After finishing this work he was called to Rome in 1971 by the Superior general of the Society of Jesus Pedro Arrupe as an assistant. He was a trusted advisor there. Calvez actively participated in preparation for the 32nd General Congregation of the Jesuits which in a still-famous decree gave the Society a mission to focus on the service of faith and the promotion of justice. Calvez was elected General Assistant to Arrupe .

As a deputy to Arrupe Calvez worked hard to implement in the life and works of the Society the spirit of this new faith-and-justice paradigm. Difficulties and misunderstandings were large and conflicts were not lacking. Until Arrupe was stricken by a blood clot forcing him to step down from his leadership of the Society Calvez worked with Paolo Dezza pontifical delegate named by Pope John Paul II and together they prepared the Society for the 33rd General Congregation that would elect the new Superior General Peter Hans Kolvenbach.

Back in France Father Calvez was the director of the Center for Social Research and Action from 1984 to 1989 and editor-in-chief of the magazine Études from 1989 to 1995. He helped with the revival of social weeks in France as a member of the associations administrative council from 1985 to 2000.

During these years he continued to write on economic social and political questions and on Catholic social teaching especially in the magazine Projet of which he was the director for many years. Faithful to the memory of Pedro Arrupe to whom he was more a close friend than a subordinate he made better known the profoundly religious thought and personality of this 28th Superior general of the Society of Jesus.

Calvez also presented in front of many audiences. He taught in the department of social ethics at the Jesuit faculty of Sèvres-Paris from 2002 to 2006 and at the invitation of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger gave a series of sermons in the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Georgetown University in Washington D.C. made him a member of its administrative council. Every year Calvez went to Argentina for summer classes.

Calvez died in Paris on January 11 2010 of complications from a pulmonary edema.

In addition to numerous articles on social economic and political questions Jean-Yves Calvez is the author of the following books"
Albert Camus,"Albert Camus ; 7 November 1913 4 January 1960 was a French philosopher author and journalist. He was awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44 the second-youngest recipient in history. His works include The Stranger The Plague The Myth of Sisyphus The Fall and The Rebel.

Camus was born in French Algeria to Pieds Noirs parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the University of Algiers. He was in Paris when the Germans invaded France during World War II in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the French Resistance where he served as editor-in-chief at Combat an outlawed newspaper. After the war he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the left that opposed the Soviet Union because of its totalitarianism. Camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho-syndicalism. He was part of many organisations seeking European integration. During the Algerian War he kept a neutral stance advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.

Philosophically Camuss views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism. He is also considered to be an existentialist even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.

Albert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighbourhood in Mondovi in French Algeria. His mother Catherine Hélène Camus was French with Balearic Spanish ancestry. His father Lucien Camus a poor French agricultural worker died in the Battle of the Marne in 1914 during World War I. Camus never knew him. Camus his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of Algiers. He was a second-generation French in Algeria a French territory from 1830 until 1962. His paternal grandfather along with many others of his generation had moved to Algeria for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence he was called pied-noir black foota slang term for French who were born in Algeriaand his identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life. Nevertheless Camus was a French citizen and enjoyed more rights than Arab and Berber Algerians under indigénat. During his childhood Camus developed a love for football and swimming.

Under the influence of his teacher Louis Germain Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious lyceum near Algiers. In 1930 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Because it is a transmitted disease he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault a butcher who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher Jean Grenier. He was impressed by ancient Greek philosophers and Friedrich Nietzsche. During that time he was only able to study part-time. To earn money he took odd jobs as a private tutor car parts clerk and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.

In 1933 Camus enrolled at the University of Algiers and completed his licence de philosophie in 1936; after presenting his thesis on Plotinus. Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers but Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as Stendhal Herman Melville Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Franz Kafka. In 1933 he also met Simone Hié then a partner of a friend of Camus who would become his first wife.

Camus played goalkeeper for the Racing Universitaire dAlger junior team from 1928 to 1930. The sense of team spirit fraternity and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously. In match reports he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17. Camus drew parallels among football human existence morality and personal identity. For him the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church. 

In 1934 aged 20 Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hié. Simone suffered from an addiction to morphine a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship but Camus married Hié to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced. Camus was a womaniser throughout his life.

Camus joined the French Communist Party in early 1935. He saw it as a way to fight inequalities between Europeans and natives in Algeria even though he was not a Marxist. He explained We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities. Camus left the PCF a year later. In 1936 the independence-minded Algerian Communist Party was founded and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camuss main role within the PCA was to organise the Théâtre du Travail . Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Algérien which was a moderate anti-colonialistnationalist party. As tensions in the interwar period escalated the Stalinist PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camuss mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Théâtre de lEquipe . Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.

In 1938 Camus began working for the leftist newspaper Alger républicain as he had strong anti-fascist feelings and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative colonialism as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the Arabs and Berbers by French authorities. Alger républicain was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at Paris-Soir as editor-in-chief. In Paris he almost completed his first cycle of works dealing with the absurd and the meaninglessthe novel LÉtranger or The Stranger the philosophical essay Le Mythe de Sisyphe and the play Caligula. Each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a theatrical play.

Soon after Camus moved to Paris the outbreak of World War II began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris Camus fled. He was laid off from Paris-Soir and ended up in Lyon where he married pianist and mathematician Francine Faure on 3 December 1940. Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria where he taught in primary schools. Because of his tuberculosis he moved to the French Alps on medical advice. There he began writing his second cycle of works this time dealing with revolta novel La Peste and a play Le Malentendu . By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with Jean-Paul Sartre. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including Simone de Beauvoir André Breton and others. Among them was the actress María Casares who would later have an affair with Camus.

Camus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the French Occupation. Upon his arrival in Paris he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper Combat. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France. Camus used a pseudonym for his Combat articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four Lettres à un Ami Allemand explaining why resistance was necessary.

After the War Camus lived in Paris with Faure who gave birth to twins Catherine and Jean in 1945. Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work with the essay LHomme révolté . Camus attacked totalitarian communism while advocating libertarian socialism and anarcho-syndicalism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the Algerian War.

Camus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end. In 1944 he founded the Comité français pour la féderation européennedeclaring that Europe can only evolve along the path of economic progress democracy and peace if the nation-states become a federation. In 194748 he founded the Groupes de Liaison Internationale a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism . His main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of André Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the Soviet intervention in Hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of Francos regime in Spain.

Camus had numerous affairs particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress María Casares with whom he had extensive correspondence. Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early 1950s. Camus who felt guilty withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.

In 1957 Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating André Malraux would win the prestigious award. At age 44 he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize after Rudyard Kipling who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography Le Premier Homme in an attempt to examine moral learning. He also turned to the theatre once more. Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize he adapted and directed for the stage Dostoyevskys novel Demons. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris and was a critical success.

During these years he published posthumously the works of the philosopher Simone Weil in the series Espoir which he had founded for Éditions Gallimard. Weil had great influence on his philosophy since he saw her writings as an antidote to nihilism. Camus described her as the only great spirit of our times.

Camus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46 in a car accident near Sens in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of Villeblevin. He had spent the New Years holiday of 1960 at his house in Lourmarin Vaucluse with his family and his publisher Michel Gallimard of Éditions Gallimard along with Gallimards wife Janine and daughter. Camuss wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January but Camus decided to return in Gallimards luxurious Facel Vega HK500. The car crashed into a plane tree on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 . Camus who was in the passenger seat died instantly. Gallimard died a few days later although his wife and daughter were unharmed. There has been speculation that Camus was assassinated by the KGB because of his criticism of Soviet abuses.

Camuss first publication was a play called Révolte dans les Asturies written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1500 to 2000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book LEnvers et lEndroit . Both were published by Edmond Charlots small publishing house.

Camus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of LÉtranger Le Mythe de Sysiphe and Caligula. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included La Peste LHomme révolté and Les Justes . The third the cycle of the love consisted of Nemesis. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs.

The books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944 but the theme was conceived earlier at least as far back as 1936. With this cycle Camus aims to pose a question on the human condition discuss the world as an absurd place and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.

Camus began his work on the second cycle while he was in Algeria in the last months of 1942 just as the Germans were reaching North Africa. In the second cycle Camus used Prometheus who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion its metaphysics its connection to politics and examines it under the lens of modernity of historicity and the absence of a God.

After receiving the Nobel Prize Camus gathered clarified and published his pacifist leaning views at Actuelles III Chronique algérienne 19391958 . He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess Nemesis.

Two of Camuss works were published posthumously. The first entitled La mort heureuse features a character named Patrice Mersault comparable to The Strangers Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel Le Premier homme which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and its publication in 1994 sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camuss allegedly unrepentant colonialism.

Camus was a moralist; he claimed morality should guide politics. While he did not deny that morals change over time he rejected the classical Marxist view that historical material relations define morality.

Camus was also strongly critical of Marxism-Leninism especially in the case of the Soviet Union which he considered totalitarian. Camus rebuked those sympathetic to the Soviet model and their decision to call total servitude freedom. A proponent of libertarian socialism he claimed the USSR was not socialist and the United States was not liberal. His critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left most notably with his on-again off-again friend Jean-Paul Sartre.

Active in the French Resistance to the Nazi occupation of France during World War II Camus wrote for and edited the famous Resistance journal Combat. Of the French collaboration with the German occupiers he wrote Now the only moral value is courage which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people. After Frances liberation Camus remarked This country does not need a Talleyrand but a Saint-Just. The reality of the postwar tribunals soon changed his mind Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment.

Camus leaned towards anarchism a tendency that intensified in the 1950s when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt. Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation authority property the State and centralization. Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an anarcho-syndicalist.Graeme Nicholson considers Camus an existentialist anarchist.

The anarchist André Prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as Le Libertaire La Révolution prolétarienne and Solidaridad Obrera the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo .

Camus kept a neutral stance during the Algerian Revolution . While he was against the violence of the National Liberation Front he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of Pierre Mendès Unified Socialist Party and its approach to the crisis; Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant Aziz Kessous. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties. In one famous and often misquoted incident Camus confronted an Algerian critic during his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Stockholm rejecting the false equivalence of justice with revolutionary terrorism People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways. If that is justice then I prefer my mother. Camus critics have labelled the response as reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.

He was sharply critical of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s Camus devoted his efforts to human rights. In 1952 he resigned from his work for UNESCO when the UN accepted Spain under the leadership of the caudillo General Francisco Franco as a member. Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with Arthur Koestler the writer intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled Réflexions sur la peine capitale published by Calmann-Levy in 1957.

Born in Algeria to French parents Camus was familiar with the institutional racism of France against Arabs and Berbers but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens rights; members of the countrys Arab and Berber majority were not.

Camus was a vocal advocate of the new Mediterranean Culture. This was his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people in opposition to Latiny a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other Pieds-Noirsor French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea. His 1938 address on The New Mediterranean Culture represents Camuss most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the BlumViollette proposal to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. In 1939 Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the Alger républicain on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the Kabylie highlands. He advocated for economic educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.

In 1945 following the Sétif and Guelma massacre after Arab revolts against French mistreatment Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.

When the Algerian War began in 1954 Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the Pieds-Noirs such as his own parents and defended the French governments actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the new Arab imperialism led by Egypt and an anti-Western offensive orchestrated by Russia to encircle Europe and isolate the United States. Although favoring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation though not full-scale independence he believed the Pieds-Noirs and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty. His position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics such as Edward Said who were opposed to European imperialism and charged that Camuss novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions - or conscious erasures - of Algerias Arab population. In their eyes Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.

Camus once confided that the troubles in Algeria affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.

Even though Camus is mostly connected to absurdism he is routinely categorized as an existentialist a term he rejected on several occasions.

Camus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy Nietzsche and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as Kierkegaard Karl Jaspers and Heidegger. He also said his work The Myth of Sisyphus was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism. Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy but his critique was mostly focused on Sartrean existentialism and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom. David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism. David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that existence precedes essence.

On the other hand Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life the inevitable ending is highlighted in his acts. His belief was that the absurdlife being void of meaning or mans inability to know that meaning if it were to existwas something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers. More importantly Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism the problem of suicide. He wrote There is only one really serious philosophical question and that is suicide. Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.

Many existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. Kierkegaard explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally. Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camuss thoughts on the Absurd begin with his first cycle of books and the literary essay The Myth of Sisyphus his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in LÉtranger. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor Caligula pursuing an absurd logic which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays LEnvers et lendroit in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays Noces in 1938 and Betwixt and Between. In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in The Plague.

Camus follows Sartres definition of the Absurd That which is meaningless. Thus mans existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification. The Absurd is created because man who is placed in an unintelligent universe realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains the Absurd is the result of the confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. Even though absurdity is inescapable Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question Why should someone continue to live Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.

The turning point in Camuss attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the Revue Libre in 1943 the second in the Cahiers de Libération in 1944 and the third in the newspaper Libertés in 1945. The four letters were published as Lettres à un ami allemand in 1945 and were included in the collection Resistance Rebellion and Death.

Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a philosopher of the absurd. He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing Le Mythe de Sisyphe. To distinguish his ideas scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd when referring to Camuss Absurd.

Camus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression injustice or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough however to set the limits on the rebellion.LHomme révolté explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There he builds upon the absurd but goes further. In the introduction where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion he concludes with the phrase I revolt therefore we exist implying the recognition of a common human condition. Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebels revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime; he therefore places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution. Camus poses a crucial question Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner in a silent universe According to him the answer is yes as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions. Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First there is the metaphysical rebellion which is the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation. The other mode historical rebellion is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.

Camuss novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death interest in Camus followed the rise of the New Left. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced. He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance dialogue and civil rights.

Although Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism some neo-liberals have tried to associate him with their policies; for instance the French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested that his remains be moved to the Panthéon an idea that angered many on the Left."
Georges Canguilhem,"Georges Canguilhem was a French philosopher and physician who specialized in epistemology and the philosophy of science .

Canguilhem entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1924 as part of a class that included Jean-Paul Sartre Raymond Aron and Paul Nizan. He aggregated in 1927 and then taught in lycées throughout France taking up the study of medicine while teaching in Toulouse.

He took up a post at the Clermont-Ferrand based University of Strasbourg in 1941 and received his medical doctorate in 1943 in the middle of World War II. Using the pseudonym Lafont Canguilhem became active in the French Resistance serving as a doctor in Auvergne.

By 1948 he was the French equivalent of department chair in philosophy at Strasbourg as well. Seven years later he was named a professor at the Sorbonne and succeeded Gaston Bachelard as the director of the Institut dhistoire des sciences a post he occupied until 1971 at which time he undertook an active emeritus career.

In 1983 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. In 1987 he received the médaille dor awarded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique .

Canguilhems principal work in philosophy of science is presented in two books Le Normal et le pathologique first published in 1943 and then expanded in 1968 and La Connaissance de la vie . Le Normal et le pathologique is an extended exploration into the nature and meaning of normality in medicine and biology the production and institutionalization of medical knowledge. It is still a seminal work in medical anthropology and the history of ideas and is widely influential in part thanks to Canguilhems influence on Michel Foucault. La Connaissance de la vie is an extended study of the specificity of biology as a science the historical and conceptual significance of vitalism and the possibility of conceiving organisms not on the basis of mechanical and technical models that would reduce the organism to a machine but rather on the basis of the organisms relation to the milieu in which it lives its successful survival in this milieu and its status as something greater than the sum of its parts. Canguilhem argued strongly for these positions criticising 18th and 19th century vitalism but also cautioning against the reduction of biology to a physical science. He believed such a reduction deprived biology of a proper field of study ideologically transforming living beings into mechanical structures serving a chemicalphysical equilibrium that cannot account for the particularity of organisms or for the complexity of life. He furthered and altered these critiques in a later book Ideology and Rationality in the History of the Life Sciences.

Canguilhem was originally hostile to the ideas of Henri Bergson and vitalism but was later influenced by them and developed his own idiosyncratic brand of vitalism.

More than just a great theoretician Canguilhem was one of the few philosophers of the 20th century to develop an approach that was shaped by a medical education. He helped define a method of studying the history of science which was practical and rigorous.

As Inspector General and then President of the Jury dAgrégation in philosophy Canguilhem had a tremendous and direct influence over philosophical instruction in France in the latter half of the twentieth century and was known to more than a generation of French academic philosophers as a demanding and exacting evaluator who as Louis Althusser remarked believed he could correct the philosophical understanding of teachers by bawling them out. This belief did not prevent him from being regarded with considerable affection by the generation of intellectuals that came to the fore in the 1960s including Jacques Derrida Michel Foucault Louis Althusser and Jacques Lacan. Althusser once wrote to his English translator that my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable . Likewise Foucault in his introduction to Canguilhems The Normal and the Pathological wrote

Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about Althusser Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as Bourdieu Castel Passeron and what marks them so strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by psychoanalysts particularly by the followers of Lacan. Further in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the movement of 68 it is easy to find the place of those who from near or from afar had been trained by Canguilhem.

Derrida recalled that Canguilhem advised him early in his career that he would have to distinguish himself as a serious scholar before he could exhibit professionally the particular philosophical sense of humour for which he is at turns famous and notorious advice which Derrida seemed to have taken in earnest.

After years of neglect a great deal of Canguilhems writings have been translated into English. Among them are his celebrated works The Normal and the Pathological and Knowledge of Life as well as two collections of essays titled A Vital Rationalist and Writings on Medicine."

Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre,"Charles-Irénée Castel abbé de Saint-Pierre was a French author whose ideas were novel for his times. His proposal of an international organisation to maintain peace was perhaps the first in history with the possible exception of George of Poděbradys Tractatus . He influenced Rousseau and Kant.

Saint-Pierre was born at the château of Saint-Pierre-Église near Cherbourg where his father the Marquis de Saint-Pierre was grand bailli of Cotentin. He was educated by the Jesuits. The youngest of five children and unsuited to a military career owing to poor health he became a priest.

He was introduced by family connections into the salons of Madame de la Fayette and the Marquise de Lambert in Paris. He was elected to the Académie française in 1695 although he had previously produced no notable work; his election was an episode in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns Saint-Pierre being a clear representative of the latter. The same year he gained a footing at court as chaplain to Madame the kings sister-in-law. From 1703 to his death he was abbot of Tiron.

Contrary to a widely believed opinion it is not while working as a negotiator of the Treaty of Utrecht that he developed his project of universal peace. Saint-Pierre worked on the idea from 1708 and published early versions from 1712.

In 1718 he published Discours sur la polysynodie where he proposed that appointed ministers be replaced by elected councils. As a consequence of his criticism of the policy of Louis XIV he was expelled from the Académie later the same year.

In 1723 with Pierre-Joseph Alary he founded the Club de lEntresol an early modern think tank in Paris; the club was closed for political reasons in 1731.

Saint-Pierres works are centered on an acute and visionary criticism of politics law and social institutions. He had a great influence on Rousseau who left elaborate examinations of some of them and was a forerunner of Kants 1795 essay on perpetual peace. He can be seen as an early proponent of the ideas of the Enlightenment. His Projet de paix perpétuelle which was destined to exercise considerable influence on the development of the various schemes for securing universal peace which culminated in the Holy Alliance was published in 1713 in Utrecht where he was acting as secretary to the French plenipotentiary the Abbé de Polignac and his Polysynodie contained severe strictures on the government of Louis XIV with projects for the administration of France by a system of councils for each department of government. His works include a number of memorials and projects for stopping duelling equalizing taxation treating mendicancy reforming education and spelling etc. It was not however for his suggestions for the reform of the constitution that he was disgraced but because in the Polysynodie he had refused to Louis XIV the title of le Grand.

Saint-Pierre was one of the first to mention the possibility of a European union made by independent and autonomous states. His work on a European community directly inspired the idea of an international order based on the principle of collective self-defense and was important to the creation of the Concert of Europe and later the League of Nations whose successor is the United Nations Organisation. Friederich the Great of Prussia wrote to Voltair on the Projet pour rendre la paix perpétuelle en Europe The Abbe de Saint-Pierre has sent me a fine work on how to re-establish peace in Europe. The thing is very practicable. All it lacks to be successful is the consent of all Europe and a few other such small details.

Saint-Pierre exchanged letters with a number of luminaries of his time including Voltaire. His letters often ended with the formula Paradise to those who do good."
Cornelius Castoriadis,"Cornelius Castoriadis was a Greek-Frenchphilosopher social critic economist psychoanalyst author of The Imaginary Institution of Society and co-founder of the Socialisme ou Barbarie group.

His writings on autonomy and social institutions have been influential in both academic and activist circles.

Cornelius Castoriadis was born on 11 March 1922 in Constantinople the son of Kaisar and Sophia Kastoriadis. His family had to move in July 1922 to Athens due to the GreekTurkish population exchange. He developed an interest in politics after he came into contact with Marxist thought and philosophy at the age of 13. At the same time he began studying traditional philosophy after purchasing a copy of the book History of Philosophy by the historian of ideas Nikolaos Louvaris.

Sometime between 1932 and 1935 Maximiani Portas was the French tutor of Castoriadis. During the same period he attended the 8th Gymnasium of Athens in Kato Patisia from which he graduated in 1937.

His first active involvement in politics occurred during the Metaxas Regime when he joined the Athenian Communist Youth a section of the Young Communist League of Greece. In 1941 he joined the Communist Party of Greece only to leave one year later in order to become an active Trotskyist. The latter action resulted in his persecution by both the Germans and the Communist Party.

In 1944 he wrote his first essays on social science and Max Weber which he published in a magazine named Archive of Sociology and Ethics . Castoriadis heavily criticized the actions of the KKE during the December 1944 clashes between the communist-led ELAS on one side and the Papandreou government aided by British troops on the other.

In December 1945 three years after earning a bachelors degree in law economics and political science from the School of Law Economics and Political Sciences of the University of Athens he got aboard the RMS Mataroa a New Zealand ocean liner to go to Paris to continue his studies under a scholarship offered by the French Institute of Athens. The same voyageorganized by Octave Merlieralso brought from Greece to France a number of other Greek writers artists and intellectuals including Constantine Andreou Kostas Axelos Georges Candilis Costa Coulentianos Emmanuel Kriaras Adonis A. Kyrou Kostas Papaïoannou and Virgile Solomonidis.

Once in Paris Castoriadis joined the Trotskyist Parti Communiste Internationaliste . He and Claude Lefort constituted a ChaulieuMontal Tendency in the French PCI in 1946. In 1948 they experienced their final disenchantment with Trotskyism leading them to break away to found the libertarian socialist and councilist group and journal Socialisme ou Barbarie which included Jean-François Lyotard and Guy Debord as members for a while and profoundly influenced the French intellectual left. Castoriadis had links with the group known as the JohnsonForest Tendency until 1958. Also strongly influenced by Castoriadis and Socialisme ou Barbarie were the British group and journal Solidarity and Maurice Brinton.

In the late 1940s he started attending philosophical and sociological courses at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Paris where among his teachers were Gaston Bachelard the epistemologist René Poirier the historian of philosophy Henri Bréhier Henri Gouhier Jean Wahl Gustave Guillaume Albert Bayet and Georges Davy. He submitted a proposal for a doctoral dissertation on mathematical logic to Poirier but he eventually abandoned the project. The working title of his thesis was Introduction à la logique axiomatique .

At the same time he worked as an economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development until 1970 which was also the year when he obtained French citizenship. Consequently his writings prior to that date were published pseudonymously as Pierre Chaulieu Paul Cardan Jean-Marc Coudray etc.

In his 1949 essay The Relations of Production in Russia Castoriadis developed a critique of the supposed socialist character of the government of the Soviet Union. According to Castoriadis the central claim of the Stalinist regime at the time was that the mode of production in Russia was socialist but the mode of distribution was not yet a socialist one since the socialist edification in the country had not yet been completed. However according to Castoriadis analysis since the mode of distribution of the social product is inseparable from the mode of production the claim that one can have control over distribution while not having control over production is meaningless.

Castoriadis was particularly influential in the turn of the intellectual left during the 1950s against the Soviet Union because he argued that the Soviet Union was not a communist but rather a bureaucratic capitalist state which contrasted with Western powers mostly by virtue of its centralized power apparatus. His work in the OECD substantially helped his analyses.

In the latter years of Socialisme ou Barbarie Castoriadis came to reject the Marxist theories of economics and of history especially in an essay on Modern Capitalism and Revolution first published in Socialisme ou Barbarie in 196061 . Castoriadis final Socialisme ou Barbarie essay was Marxism and Revolutionary Theory published in April 1964 June 1965. There he concluded that a revolutionary Marxist must choose either to remain Marxist or to remain revolutionary.

When Jacques Lacans disputes with the International Psychoanalytical Association led to a split and the formation of the École Freudienne de Paris in 1964 Castoriadis became a member .

In 1968 Castoriadis married Piera Aulagnier a French psychoanalyst who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment under Jacques Lacan from 1955 until 1961.

In 1969 Castoriadis and Aulagnier split from the EFP to join the Organisation psychanalytique de langue française the so-called Quatrième Groupe a psychoanalytic group that claims to follow principles and methods that have opened up a third way between Lacanianism and the standards of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

Castoriadis began to practice analysis in 1973 .

In 1967 Castoriadis submitted a proposal for a doctoral dissertation on the philosophy of history to Paul Ricœur . An epistolary dialogue began between them but Ricœurs obligations to the University of Chicago in the 1970s were such that their collaboration was not feasible at the time. The subject of his thesis would be Le fondement imaginaire du social-historique .

In his 1975 work LInstitution imaginaire de la société and in Les carrefours du labyrinthe published in 1978 Castoriadis began to develop his distinctive understanding of historical change as the emergence of irrecoverable otherness that must always be socially instituted and named in order to be recognized. Otherness emerges in part from the activity of the psyche itself. Creating external social institutions that give stable form to what Castoriadis terms the magma of social significations allows the psyche to create stable figures for the self and to ignore the constant emergence of mental indeterminacy and alterity.

For Castoriadis self-examination as in the ancient Greek tradition could draw upon the resources of modern psychoanalysis. Autonomous individualsthe essence of an autonomous societymust continuously examine themselves and engage in critical reflection. He writes

Castoriadis was not calling for every individual to undergo psychoanalysis per se. Rather by reforming education and political systems individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion. He offers if psychoanalytic practice has a political meaning it is solely to the extent that it tries as far as it possibly can to render the individual autonomous that is to say lucid concerning her desire and concerning reality and responsible for her acts holding herself accountable for what she does.

In his 1980 Facing the War text he took the view that Russia had become the primary world military power. To sustain this in the context of the visible economic inferiority of the Soviet Union in the civilian sector he proposed that the society may no longer be dominated by the one-party state bureaucracy but by a stratocracya separate and dominant military sector with expansionist designs on the world. He further argued that this meant there was no internal class dynamic which could lead to social revolution within Russian society and that change could only occur through foreign intervention.

In 1980 he joined the faculty of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales as Directeur détudes . He had been elected Directeur de recherche in EHESS at the end of 1979 after submitting his previously published material in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project of connecting the disciplines of history sociology and economy through the concept of the social imaginary . His teaching career at the EHESS lasted sixteen years.

In 1980 he was also awarded his State doctorate from the University of Nanterre; the final title of his thesis under Ricœur was LÉlément imaginaire de lhistoire .

In 1989 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Social Sciences by Panteion University and in 1993 another one in Education Sciences by the Democritus University of Thrace.

In 1992 he joined the libertarian socialist journal Society and Nature as a writer; the magazine also featured such writers as Murray Bookchin and Noam Chomsky.

He died on 26 December 1997 from complications following heart surgery. He was survived by Zoe Christofidi his daughter Sparta and Kyveli a younger daughter from his marriage with Zoe.

Edgar Morin proposed that Castoriadis work will be remembered for its remarkable continuity and coherence as well as for its extraordinary breadth which was encyclopaedic in the original Greek sense for it offered us a paideia or education that brought full circle our cycle of otherwise compartmentalized knowledge in the arts and sciences. Castoriadis wrote essays on mathematics physics biology anthropology psychoanalysis linguistics society economics politics philosophy and art.

One of Castoriadis many important contributions to social theory was the idea that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through the social imaginary without strict determinations but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to social imaginary significations. Thus Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and the social imaginary the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former. However the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination since the individual is informed through an internalisation of social significations.

He used traditional terms as much as possible though consistently redefining them. Further some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning . When reading Castoriadis it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.

The concept of autonomy was central to his early writings and he continued to elaborate on its meaning applications and limits until his death gaining him the title of Philosopher of Autonomy. The word itself is Greek where auto means forby itself and nomos means law. It refers to the condition of self-institution by which one creates their own laws whether as an individual or as a whole society. And while every society creates their own institutions only the members of autonomous societies are fully aware of the fact and consider themselves to be the ultimate source of justice. In contrast members of heteronomous societies delegate this process to an authority outside of society often attributing the source of their traditions to divine origins or in modern times to historical necessity. Castoriadis then identified the need of societies not only to create but to legitimize their laws to explain in other words why their laws are just. Most traditional societies did that through religion claiming their laws were given by God or a mythical ancestor and therefore must be true. 

An exception to this rule is to be found in Ancient Greece where the constellation of cities that spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean although not all democratic showed strong signs of autonomy and during its peak Athens became fully aware of the fact as seen in Pericles Funeral Oration. Castoriadis considered Greece a topic that increasingly drew his attention not as a blueprint to be copied but an experiment that could inspire a truly autonomous community one that could legitimize its laws without assigning their source to a higher authority. The Greeks differed from other societies because they not only started as autonomous but maintained this ideal by challenging their laws on a constant basis while obeying them to the same degree proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist.

Regarding modern societies Castoriadis notes that while religions have lost part of their normative function their nature is still heteronomous only that this time it has rational pretenses. Capitalism legitimizes itself through reason claiming that it makes rational sense but Castoriadis observed that all such efforts are ultimately tautological in that they can only legitimize a system through the rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament claimed that There is only one God God capitalism defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of costs and then legitimizes itself based on its effectiveness to meet these criteria. Surprisingly this definition of logic is also shared by Communism which despite the fact it stands in seeming opposition it is the product of the same imaginary and uses the same concepts and categories to describe the world principally in material terms and through the process of human labor.

The term imaginary originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and is strongly associated with Castoriadis work. Castoriadis believed that for a given society as we penetrate the layers of its culture deeper and deeper we arrive at meanings that do not mean something other than themselves. They are so to speak final meanings that the society in question has imposed on the world on itself. Because these meanings do not point to anything concrete and because the logical categories needed to analyze them are derived from them these meanings cannot be analysed rationally. They are arational and must therefore be acknowledged rather than comprehended in the common use of the term. Castoriadis views on concept formation is in sharp contrast to that of postmodernists like Jacques Derrida who explicitly denies the existence of concepts in and off themselves.

Radical imaginary is at the basis of cultures and accounts for their differences. In his seminal work The Imaginary Institution of Society Castoriadis argues that societies are founded not as products of historical necessity but as the result of a new and radical idea of the world an idea that appears to spring fully formed and is practically irreducible. All cultural forms follow from this radical imaginary and are not to be explained merely as products of material conditions. Castoriadis then is offering an ontogenetic or emergentist model of history one that is apparently unpopular amongst modern historians but can serve as a valuable critique of historical materialism. For example Castoriadis believed that Ancient Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from Chaos while in contrast the Hebrews had an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a rational entity God or Yahweh in the Hebrew Bible. The former developed therefore a system of direct democracy where the laws were ever changing according to the peoples will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God.

Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries expressed through various creation myths by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason . That same imaginary is the foundation of its opposing ideology Communism. By that measure he observes that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought since they share the same industrial revolution type imaginary that of a rational society where mans welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not as he claimed the main drive of social change since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first. Similarly in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real thus perpetuating the problem.

Castoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science. This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created. In the second part of his Imaginary Institution of Society he gives the example of set theory which is at the basis of formal logic which cannot function without having first defined the elements which are to be assigned to sets. This initial schema of separation of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore precedes the application of logic and consequently science.

Castoriadis was a social constructionist and a moral relativist insofar as he held that the radical imaginary of each society was opaque to rational analysis. Since he believed that social norms and morals ultimately derive from a societys unique idea of the world which emerges fully formed at a given moment in history and cannot be reduced further. From this he concluded that any criteria by which one could evaluate these morals objectively are also derived from the said imaginary rendering this evaluation subjective. This does not mean that Castoriadis stopped believing in the value of social struggles for a better world he simply thought that rationally proving their value is impossible.

This however does not mean that Castoriadis believed there is no truth but that truth is linked to the imaginary which is ultimately arational. In his book World in Fragments which includes essays on science he explicitly writes that We have to understand that there is truth - and that it is to be madeto be done that to attain it we have to create it which means first and foremost to imagine it. He then quotes Blake who said What is now proved was once only imagind.

The concept of Chaos as found in Ancient Greek cosmogony plays a significant role in Castoriadis work and is connected to the idea of the imaginary. Castoriadis translates the Greek word chaos as nothingness. According to him the core of the Greek imaginary was a world that came from Chaos rather than the will of God as described in Genesis. Castoriadis concludes that the Greeks imaginary of a world out of chaos was what allowed them to create institutions such as democracy because if the world is created out of nothing man can model it as he sees fit without trying to conform to some divine law. He contrasted the Greek imaginary to the Biblical imaginary in which God is a willing agent and mans position is to understand Gods will and act according to it.

Castoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek cities not as a model to imitate rather as a source of inspiration towards an autonomous society. He rejects also the term city state used to describe Ancient Greek cities; for him the administration of Greek poleis was not that of a State in the modern sense of the term since Greek poleis were selfadministrated. The same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring Phoenicians who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean were monarchical till their end. During this time of colonization however around the time of Homers epic poems we observe for the first time that the Greeks instead of transferring their mother citys social system to the newly established colony instead for the first time in known history legislate anew from the ground up. What also made the Greeks special was the fact that following the above they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy.

This phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the Renaissance again as a product of small independent merchants.

He sees a tension in the modern West between on the one hand the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of open societies and on the other hand the spirit-crushing force of capitalism. These are respectively characterized as the creative imaginary and the capitalist imaginary

I think that we are at a crossing in the roads of history history in the grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out at least in its general orientation. Thats the road of the loss of meaning of the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary.The other road should be opened it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.

He argues that in the last two centuries ideas about autonomy again come to the fore This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950. This is a very specific period because of the very great density of cultural creation but also because of its very strongsubversiveness.

Castoriadis has influenced European thought in important ways. His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent . Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis work to a North American sociological audience and Johann Pál Arnason has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public . In the last few years there has been growing interest in Castoriadiss thought including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnasons former students Jeff Kloogers Castoriadis Psyche Society Autonomy and Suzi Adamss Castoriadiss Ontology Being and Creation ."
Jean Cavaillès,"Jean Cavaillès was a French philosopher and logician who specialized in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of science. He took part in the French Resistance within the Libération movement and was arrested by the Gestapo on 17 February 1944 and shot on 4 April 1944.

Cavaillès was born in Saint-Maixent Deux-Sèvres. After passing his first baccalauréat in 1919 and baccalauréats in mathematics and philosophy the following year he studied at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand including two years of classes préparatoires before entering the École Normale Supérieure in 1923 reading philosophy. In 1927 he passed the agrégation competitive exam. He began graduate studies in Philosophy in 1928 under the supervision of Léon Brunschvicg. Cavaillès won a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship in 19291930. In 1931 he travelled extensively in Germany; in Göttingen he conceived jointly with Emmy Noether the project of publishing the Cantor--Dedekind correspondence. He was a teaching assistant at the École Normale Supérieure between 1929 and 1935 then teacher at the Lycée dAmiens in 1936. In 1937 he successfully defended his doctoral theses at the University of Paris and became a Doctor of Letters in Philosophy. He was then appointed maître de conférences in Logic and in General Philosophy at the University of Strasbourg.

After the outbreak of World War II he was mobilized in 1939 as an infantry lieutenant with the 43rd Regiment and was later attached to the Staff of the 4th Colonial Division. He was honoured for bravery twice and was captured on 11 June 1940. At the end of July 1940 he escaped from Belgium and fled to Clermont-Ferrand where the university of Strasbourg was re-organized.

At the end of December 1940 he met Emmanuel dAstier de la Vigerie with whom he created a small group of resistance fighters known as the Last Column. To reach a broader audience they created a newspaper which was to become Libération. It served as the mouthpiece of both Libération-Sud and Libération-Nord. Cavaillès took an active part in editing the paper. The first edition appeared in July 1941.

In 1941 he was appointed professor at the Sorbonne and left Clermont-Ferrand for Paris where he helped form the Libération-Nord resistance group becoming part of its management committee.

In April 1942 at the instigation of Christian Pineau the central Office of Information and Action of London charged him with the task of forming an intelligence network in the Northern Zone known as Cohors. He was ordered by Christian Pineau to pass into the Southern Zone and Cavaillès headed the network and formed similar groups in Belgium and the north of France.

In September 1942 he was arrested with Pineau in Narbonne by the French police. After a failed escape attempt to London he was interned in Montpellier at the Saint-Paul d Eyjeaux prison camp from where he escaped at the end of December 1942. The book Cavaillès wrote in prison in Montpellier in 1942 was published posthumously in 1946 edited by the epistemologist Georges Canguilhem and the mathematician Charles Ehresmann under the title Sur la logique et la theorie de la science.

Denounced as a public enemy by the Vichy regime and sought by the police he fled clandestinely to London in February 1943. There he met General Charles de Gaulle on several occasions.

Back in France on 15 April he resigned from the management Committee of the Libération movement in order to dedicate himself entirely to direct action. He was in charge of the sabotage of the stores of the Kriegsmarine in Brittany and German radio installations on the coast.

Betrayed by one of his liaison officers. Tortured imprisoned in Fresnes then in Compiègne he was transferred to the Citadel from Arras and was reported as being executed there on 17 February 1944. New research in 2015 revealed this date was incorrect and he was sentenced and executed on 4 April 1944. Buried at first in Arras under a wooden cross marked unknown n5 his body was exhumed in 1946 to be buried in the Crypt in the Sorbonne in Paris.

The Centre Cavaillès de lÉcole Normale Supérieure was established in Paris in 1969 at 3e étage au 29 rue dUlm as Centre for the Study of the History and Philosophy of Science. At the formal opening philosopher Georges Canguilhem said A philosopher-mathematician loaded with explosives lucid and reckless resolute without optimism. If thats not a hero what is a hero 

Cavaillès is honored in the Heroes of the Resistance postage stamp set.

In LArmée des ombres a 1969 film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville the character of Luc Jardie was in part inspired by Cavaillès. Jardies chief operative recuperating from injuries in a hideaway has only five books; the title of each is a publication of Cavaillès though the author is shown as Luc Jardie."

Challaye was the author of many books on philosophy. He also published childrens books under the pseudonym of Robert Fougère.

Challaye died on 26 April 1967 in Paris France. The rue Félicien Challaye in Tunis Tunisia was named in his honor."
William of Champeaux,"Guillaume de Champeaux known in English as William of Champeaux and Latinised to Gulielmus de Campellis was a French philosopher and theologian.

William was born at Champeaux near Melun. After studying under Anselm of Laon and Roscellinus he taught in the school of the cathedral of Notre-Dame of which he was made canon in 1103. Among his pupils was Peter Abelard of which he had a disagreement with because Abelard challenged some of his ideas and William thought Abelard was too arrogant. Abelard calls him the supreme master of dialectic after he replaced his master as the new teacher. In 1108 he resigned his positions as archdeacon of Paris and master of Notre Dame and retreated to the shrine of St Victor outside the city walls of Paris where under his influence there formed what would become the abbey of St Victor.

He was a friend of Bernard of Clairvaux having helped Bernard recuperate from ill-health later he motivated Bernard to write some of his important works including the Apologia which was dedicated to William.

William left St Victor in 1113 when he became bishop of Châlons-en-Champagne in which time he took part in the dispute concerning investitures as a supporter of Pope Callixtus II whom he represented at the conference of Mousson. In 1114 he issued the Grande charte champenoise which defined the agricultural and viticultural possessions of the Abbey of Saint-Pierre-aux-Monts thus giving rise to the modern-day Champagne wine region. After relinquishing his Benedictine Abbacy he moved to a Cistercian monastery in Rheims where he also composed a number of spiritual books such as his Vita Prima which were widely read in monastic circles.

His surviving works are a fragment on the Eucharist inserted by Jean Mabillon in his edition of the works of St Bernard and the Moralia A brevi ala and De Origine Animae. In the last of these he maintains that children who die unbaptized must be lost the pure soul being defiled by the grossness of the body and declares that Gods will is not to be questioned. He upholds the theory of Creationism . Ravaisson-Mollien has discovered a number of fragments by him among which the most important is the De Essentia Dei et de Substantia Dei; a Liber Sententiarum consisting of discussions on ethics and scriptural interpretation is also ascribed to Champeaux.

He is considered the founder of an early version of moderate realism a philosophy which held that universals exist in particular things as common substances individuated by accidents and in the mind as concepts."
Georges Chapouthier,"Georges Chapouthier is a French neuroscientist and philosopher.

Georges Chapouthier is the son of Odette Mazaubert and Fernand Chapouthier . Fernand Chapouthier was a classicist and archeologist who was deputy director of the Ecole normale supérieure in Paris. Odette Mazaubert was known under the pseudonym of Carquelin for her Saintongeais writings. Chapouthier attended the Lycée Montaigne and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He then followed the Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles at the Lycée Saint-Louis and subsequently enrolled at the Ecole normale supérieure in 1964. Chapouthier then studied biology and philosophy obtaining a doctorat détat in both .

During his whole career Chapouthier has worked for the French National Centre for Scientific Research where he currently has the rank of emeritus research director. His research focuses on the pharmacology of memory and anxiety and on philosophy especially the relations between humans and animals.

As a philosopher he was influenced by Louis Bourgey and François Dagognet."
Bernard Charbonneau,"Bernard Charbonneau was a French writer who authored about twenty books and numerous articles published in La Gueule Ouverte Foi et Vie La République des Pyrénées. An apolitical and independent thinker he is considered to be a major inspiration for the various French ecological movements. His name is regularly mentioned by French academics. as well French green party leaders.

The underlying idea inspiring his books and articles is that the link that attaches individual persons to society is so strong that even in the so called individualistic society people struggle to exercise the critical thinking needed to resist mass trends and end up readily consenting to the annihilation of what they cherish most their freedom.

In the 1930s he associates economic development to a form of dictatorship and becomes recognized as a pioneer in political ecology. Skeptical about all forms of partisanship including in the area of ecology he lays out the foundation of a new type of society based on personal experience in rupture with 20th century most accepted ideologies. He shares many of the personalist views of his six decade old friend Jacques Ellul regarding technological progress which they mostly see as a source of conformism and a threat to freedom.

Charbonneau was born in Bordeaux in 1910 to a bourgeois family from Lot et Garonne. His father was Protestant and his mother Catholic. The life in a large city quickly made Young Charbonneau feel oppressed. From his own admission he was an average student. He obtained a baccalaureat in French literature and attended the University of Bordeaux to study history and geography. At the age of 24 he started his teaching career and received agrégation the following year.

At the end of World War II he preferred to leave town and settle in the countryside skipping the opportunity to further his academic achievements in a large city. He accepted a teaching position in a small normal school in Lescar near Pau in the Pre-Pyrenees . He stayed there until he retired. He produced a strong impression on his students. He enjoyed the proximity to nature and lived a spartan life near the Gaves de Pau then Oloron.

Charbonneau died in 1996 of liver cancer in the hospital of Saint Palais. He is buried on his property in Le Boucau in Saint-Pé-de-Léren. On his grave one can read this adapted citation from the book of Ruth wherever you go Ill go; wherever you stay Ill stay and your God will be my God. After his death his wife Henriette Louise Daudin took care of publishing his unpublished writings. She died of cardiac arrest in December 2015.

Charbonneau has had four children Simone Juliette Catherine and Martine.

In 2006 the personal archives of Charbonneau were transferred to the library of the Institut détudes politiques de Bordeaux.

Charbonneau started various discussion groups some with Jacques Ellul who was his friend for his entire life with the aim to talk and think about the changes resulting from scientific and technical progress. As young adults Ellul and his friend Charbonneau already had the intuition of what would be the architecture of their entire works. Their works were parallel if not common. If unlike Elluls Charbonneaus work was not fully known to the public at the time Ellul knew exactly how much he owed to Charbonneau. Ellul admits that without his friend who was a genius and taught him how to think he would never have understood the technical society phenomenon explains Patrick Troude-Chastenet.

Following the creation by Emmanuel Mounier of the magazine Esprit in 1932 Charbonneau decided to join the French personalist movement and renamed his group le groupe personaliste du Sud-Ouest. Charbonneau was careful about not confining his group in pure theories but making it experience personalism in practice. He took his friends in long hikes in Galicia the Canary Islands in the Spanish Pyrenees as well as in the Aspe valley and in Saint-Pé-de-Léren.

Between 1940 and 1947 Charbonneau designed the structure of his work and wrote a voluminous book entitled Par la force des choses whose content announced the twenty or so books that would follow. His analysis of the contradictions in the world led to the anticipation of something worse than political totalitarianism social totalitarianism resulting from the unstoppable technological progress.Based on the analysis of the social and political evolution he witnessed in the 1930s and in the 1940s he was able to anticipate issues that were later recognized as crucial in society. He noted the problems resulting from ever more technocratic social political and ecological spheres from State propaganda and mass communication from the move from fine art to entertainment and consumerism and from the liquidation of traditional farming among other factors. He was not in a position to communicate his thoughts as a whole and therefore tried to expose it in details in separate books. His books lEtat and Je fus are the two major cornerstones of his work previously announced in Par la force des choses. He could not find any editors to publish them so he used a spirit duplicator to distribute copies to a close circle of friends. Those two books would eventually be published some 50 years later. Charbonneau resumed the analysis of the industrial society that he had started before the war under a book named Pan se meurt. There again he could not find any editor. He waited 20 years before Editions Gallimard published his book under a renamed title Le Jardin de Babylone. His analysis of the chaotic effects of technological and industrial progress were published in 1973 under the title Le système et le chaos. His thoughts on the contradictions of the liberal conception of freedom were published in 2002 under the title Prométhée réenchaîné.

A number of Charbonneaus writings have still not be published to this day. There exists a bibliography of Charbonneau on the website of the Association Internationale Jacques Ellul

Bernard Charbonneau has published a large number of articles most notably in La Gueule ouverte La République des Pyrénées and Combat Nature .

Here are two important articles written in the 1930s where Charbonneau explains and lays out the foundation of his thoughts"
Daniel Charles,"Daniel Paul Charles was a French musician musicologist and philosopher. He was born on 27 November 1935 in Oran and died on 21 August 2008 in Antibes .

He was a student of Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatory of Music he received the aggregation in philosophy in 1959 and a PhD under the direction of Mikel Dufrenne in 1977.

After leading the Commission charged with establishing the status of professorship of music at the French Ministry of Education he founded and lead for twenty years the Department of Music of University of Paris VIII . He was also responsible from 1970 to 1980 for the teaching of general aesthetics at the University of Paris IV . He decided to end his career by teaching philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis .

When he graduated from the Paris Conservatory of Music in 1956 he participated in the GRM under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer and proposed to set into electronic music Stéphane Mallarmés Coup de dés in Darmstadt a project which caught the attention of Karlheinz Stockhausen. But his lack of enthusiasm toward the solfège des bruits of Schaeffer led him to focus instead on John Cage whom he met in 1958. He contributed then to present Cages music and philosophy in France Pour les oiseaux published first in French became a classic book. It was later published in English For the Birds.

Daniel Charles has been invited by many universities to lecture and has published many articles and several books five of which have been translated into German and two into Japanese.

More than 200 articles published in several magazines in collective books and several encyclopedias prefaces LPs and CDs booklets etc."
Jean-Émile Charon,"Jean-Émile Charon was a French nuclear physicist philosopher and writer. He was the author of over 20 books on physics scientific philosophy and computer science. He conducted nuclear research at Frances Commissariat à lénergie atomique .

Charon muses in his book The Spirit That Stranger Inside Us There are microscopic individualities inside every human. They think they know and carry Spirit in the Universe. Charon chooses to call these individual beings of intelligence eons. They are otherwise known as electrons. Each electron or eon is an enclosed space a thinking entity intelligence and even a micro-universe. But this is an inaccurate way of speaking about them because as Michael Talbot warns us in The Holographic Universe the only time quanta ever manifest as particles is when we are looking at them. Thus it would be more accurate to think of these beings in terms of wave interference patterns.

The goal of the electron is developing the order of its Spirit. There are four psychic forces that organize living forms into entities of increasing energy or order reflection knowledge love and action. As the order grows so do the psychic properties.

Ecstasy says Charon is the higher level of excitement felt when the electron fills one plane with photon energy to the threshold at which it jumps to the next quantum levelignites until the entire system is fully energized."
Pierre Charron,"Pierre Charron French Catholic theologian and major contributor to the new thought of the 17th century. He is remembered for his controversial form of skepticism and his separation of ethics from religion as an independent philosophical discipline.

Pierre Charron was born in Paris one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller. After studying law at Orléans and Bourges he practiced as an advocate for a few years. He then entered the church and soon became a popular priest rising to become a canon.

He moved to the southwest of France invited by Arnaud de Pontac Bishop of Bazas. He was appointed priest in ordinary to Marguerite de Valois wife of Henry IV of Navarre. In about 1588 Charron decided to become a monk but being rejected by both the Carthusians and the Celestines he returned to his old profession. He delivered a course of sermons at Angers and in the next year moved to Bordeaux where he formed a famous friendship with Michel de Montaigne. On Montaignes death in 1592 Charron was requested in the will to bear the Montaigne arms.

From 1594 he used his own name; he spent from 1594 to 1600 under the protection of Antoine Hérbrard de Saint-SulpiceBishop of Cahors who appointed him grand vicar and theological canon. His first book led to his being chosen deputy to the general assembly of the clergy for which he became chief secretary.

Charron retired to Condom in 1600; he died suddenly of a stroke; his works were then receiving attention.

Charron first published his works anonymously. Later he wrote under the name of Benoit Vaillant Advocate of the Holy Faith. While Charrons reading of Montaigne is now considered dogmatic and indeed something of a distortion it was important in its time and during the 17th century as a whole.

In 1594 he published a long work Les Trois Vérités in which Charron sought to prove that there is a God and a true religion that the true religion is Christianity and that the true church is Roman Catholicism. It was a response to the Protestant work Le Traité de lEglise by Philippe de Mornay. In the second edition there is an elaborate reply to criticisms of the third Vérité by a Protestant writer. Les Trois Vérités ran through several editions.

Then followed in 1600 Discours chretiens a book of sermons with a similar tone half of which is about the Eucharist.

In 1601 Charron published in Bordeaux his third work De la sagesse a system of moral philosophy that develops ideas of Montaigne. Charron also connected Montaignes scepticism with the anti-rational strand in Christianity. It received the support of Henry IV and of magistrate Pierre Jeannin. A second revised edition appeared in 1603 supported by Claude Dormy the second Bishop of Boulogne.

De la sagesse also was attacked in particular by the Jesuit François Garasse who described Charron as an atheist.

A summary and defence of the book written shortly before his death appeared in 1606. In 1604 Charrons friend Michel de la Roche prefixed a Life to an edition of De la sagesse which depicts Charron as an amiable man of good character. His complete works with this contribution by de la Roche were published in 1635. An abridgment of the Sagesse is given in Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemanns Philosophie vol. ix. An edition with notes by A. Duval appeared in 1820. It was translated into English as Of Wisdome by Samson Lennard; and again by George Stanhope .

Apart from the major influence of Montaigne Charron took from Raymond of Sabunde . Another influence was neostoicism as handled by Justus Lipsius.

According to Charron the soul located in the ventricles of the brain is affected by the temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces acute intelligence; the moist memory; the hot imagination. Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties he writes the branches of science corresponding with each. On the nature of the soul he quotes opinions. The belief in its immortality he says is the most universal of beliefs but the most feebly supported by reason. As to a humans power of attaining truth he declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish truth from error. In comparing humans with animals Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. Though inferior in some respects in others animals are superior. Namely humanitys essential qualities are vanity weakness inconstancy and presumption.

Charron writes that all religions teach that God is to be appeased by prayers presents vows but especially and most irrationally by human suffering. Each religion is said by its devotees to have commenced by divine inspiration. A human is a Christian Jew or Muslim before he or she knows that they are persons. Furthermore he writes that one religion is built upon another.

While Charron declares religion to be strange to common sense the practical result at which he arrives is that one is not to sit in judgment on his or her faith but to be simple and obedient and to submit to public authority. He writes that this is one rule of wisdom with regard to religion. Another equally important is to avoid superstition which he defines as the belief that God is like a hard judge who eager to find fault narrowly examines our slightest act that he is vengeful and hard to appease and that therefore he must be flattered and won over by pain and sacrifice.

Charron states that true piety which is the first of duties is the knowledge of God and of ones self; the latter knowledge being necessary to the former. The belief that what God sends is all good and that all the bad is from ourselves is the abasing of humanity and the exalting of God. It leads to spiritual worship for external ceremony is merely for our advantage not for his glory.

Charron is a founder of modern secularism. He declares the sovereign to be the source of law and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous."
Amalric of Bena,"Amalric of Bena was a French theologian philosopher and sect leader after whom the Amalricians are named.

Amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at Bennes a village between Ollé and Chauffours in the diocese of Chartres.

Amalric taught philosophy and theology at the University of Paris and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle dialectician his lectures developing the philosophy of Aristotle attracted a large audience. In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university and on a personal appeal to Pope Innocent III the sentence was ratified Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.

His death was caused it is said by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.In 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris and Amalrics own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds. The doctrines of his followers known as the Amalricians were formally condemned by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215.

Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from a selective reading Eriugena whose expressions he developed in a one-sided and strongly pantheistic form.

Only three propositions can be attributed to him with certainty

Because of the first proposition God himself is thought to be invisible and only recognizable in his creation.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation the first in the Biblical patriarch Abraham marking the epoch of the Father; the second in Jesus Christ who began the epoch of the Son; and the third in Amalric and his disciples who inaugurated the era of the Holy Ghost.

Due to persecutions this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder. Not long after the burning of ten of their members the sect itself lost its importance while some of the surviving Amalricians became Brethren of the Free Spirit.

According to Hosea Ballou then Pierre Batiffol and George T. Knight Amalric believed that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by Pope Innocent III."
Bernard of Chartres,"Bernard of Chartres was a twelfth-century French Neo-Platonist philosopher scholar and administrator.

The date and place of his birth are unknown. He was believed to have been the elder brother of Thierry of Chartres and to be of Breton origin but research has shown that this is unlikely. He is recorded at the cathedral school of Chartres by 1115 and was chancellor until 1124. There is no proof that he was still alive after 1124.

Gilbert de la Porrée and William of Conches were students of his and some information about his work comes through their writings as well as the writings of John of Salisbury. According to John of Salisbury Bernard composed a prose treatise De expositione Porphyrii a metrical treatise on the same subject a moral poem on education and probably a fourth work in which he sought to reconcile Plato with Aristotle. Fragments of these treatises are to be found in Johns Metalogicon and Policraticus .Hauréau confounds Bernard of Chartres with Bernardus Silvestris and assigns to the former works which are to be ascribed to the latter.

The earliest attribution of the phrase standing on the shoulders of giants is to Bernard 

Bernard of Chartres used to say that we and thus we are able to see more and farther than the latter. And this is not at all because of the acuteness of our sight or the stature of our body but because we are carried aloft and elevated by the magnitude of the giants.

Bernard in common with others of his school devoted more attention to the study of the Timaeus and the works of the Neo-Platonists than to the study of the dialectical treatises of Aristotle and the commentaries of Boethius. Consequently he not only discussed the problem of universals but also occupied himself with problems of metaphysics and cosmology.

According to Bernard there are three categories of reality God matter and idea. God is supreme reality. Matter was brought out of nothingness by Gods creative act and is the element which in union with Ideas constitutes the world of sensible things. Ideas are the prototypes by means of which the world was from all eternity present to the Divine Mind; they constitute the world of Providence and are eternal but not coeternal with God. According to John of Salisbury Bernard also taught that there exist native formscopies of the Ideas created with matterwhich are alone united with matter. It is difficult however to determine what was Bernards doctrine on this point. It is sufficient to note that he reproduced in his metaphysical doctrines many of the characteristic traits of Platonism and Neo-Platonism the intellect as the habitat of Ideas the world-soul eternal matter matter as the source of imperfection etc.

Bernard argued that matter although caused by God existed from all eternity. In the beginning before its union with the Ideas it was in a chaotic condition. It was by means of the native forms which penetrate matter that distinction order regularity and number were introduced into the universe.

Paul Edward Dutton has shown that a set of anonymous glosses on Platos Timaeus must be attributed to Bernard. These glosses edited by Dutton are Bernards only extant work."
Thierry of Chartres,"Thierry of Chartres or Theodoric the Breton was a twelfth-century philosopher working at Chartres and Paris France.

The cathedral school at Chartres promoted scholarship before the first university was founded in France. Thierry was a major figure in twelfth-century philosophy and learning and like many twelfth-century scholars is notable for his embrace of Platos Timaeus and his application of philosophy to theological issues. Some modern scholars believed Thierry to have been a brother of Bernard of Chartres who had founded the school of Chartres but later research has shown that this is unlikely.

Thierry became chancellor of Chartres after his predecessor Gilbert of Poitiers returned to his native city in 1141. John of SalisburyHerman of Carinthia and Clarembald of Arras were among Thierrys students.

The Hexaemeron interprets the Genesis with reference to Platos Timaeus. The text serves as a reasoned defense of Gods existence by relying on Platonic natural philosophy and Aristotelian logic to explain the creation of the world. Thierry establishes that the moment of divine creation was the very beginning of time and following that creation evolved naturally through combinations of the four elements . According to Thierry God created the four elements in the first moment. Fire which is constantly moving rotated and lit up the air causing the first night and day. On the second day fire warmed the water causing it to rise into the heavens and form clouds. Because of the reduction of water land emerged on the third day. The continued heating of the waters above the firmament caused the water to create the heavenly bodies on the fourth day. The continued warming of land caused the plant animal and human life to arise on the fifth and sixth days.

Thierrys explanation of the creation of the world is based on a theological interpretation of Aristotles four causes which he identifies with the three persons of the Trinity plus matter the Father is the efficient cause the Son is the formal cause the Holy Spirit is the final cause and the four elements are the material cause.

According to Thierry the act of divine creation is limited to the creation of the four elements which then evolve by themselves mix according to mathematical proportions and make up the physical world.

The Heptateuch is a broad encyclopedia of information relating to the liberal arts all within the context of academic and theologic unity. It particularly examines the ways in which different types of knowledge can be distinguished while still supporting a single purpose explaining order in reality. The trivium address the veracity consistency and beauty of the language of expression. The quadrivium provide the intellectual content in need of expression.

Thierry also wrote some commentaries on Boethius De Trinitate."
François Châtelet,"François Châtelet was a historian of philosophy political philosophy and professor in the socratic tradition. He was the husband of philosopher Noëlle Châtelet the sister of Lionel Jospin.

Châtelet was born and died in Paris. Along with Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze he is at the origin of the department of philosophy at the University of Vincennes and co-founded the Collège international de philosophie . In 1971 he was professor at the University of São Paulo. This was an act of protest that he made with Jean-Pierre Vernant against the Brazilian military government . Châtelet has always been concerned with linking thought and action engaging in a restless combat with his contemporaries. 

His conception of philosophy makes him more of a historian of philosophy than a philosopher. In his work une histoire de la raison he shows the role of philosophy in the constitution of modern Western rationality. His work Platon is a formidable invitation-initiation to the thought of the ancient Greek philosopher."
Gilles Châtelet,"Gilles Châtelet was a French philosopher and mathematician.

Châtelet began studying at the École Normale Supérieure Fontenay-Saint-Cloud-Lyon in 1963. During the student upheavals of the late 1960s and the following years he was a member of the Communist Party and associated with the Front homosexuel daction révolutionnaire . He became a gay activist due to his time in California in 1969 but went to the FHAR as a way of finding again the ambiance of the United States. He later studied at University of Paris XI where he obtained his PhD in pure mathematics on 20 December 1975 and wrote his thesis on differential topology.

Châtelet became a professor of mathematics in 1979 at the University of Paris VIII St. Denis . From 1981 to 1983 he was the scientific attaché at the French embassy in Israel. He was the program director at the International College of Philosophy from 1989 to 1995. He is known to have designed a seminar titled Love Science Philosophy. In 1994 he joined the Laboratory of Thinking Science which was just founded by Charles Alunni where until his death he taught an influential seminar titled Action Power and Virtuality.

In 1986 he began writing for LAutre until the journals closure by its publisher Michel Butel in 1990.

In 1993 Éditions du Seuil published his book Les Enjeux du mobile which was a study of mathematics physics and philosophy. In this book Châtelet tries to reflect on the perception of movement in philosophy mathematics and physics by way of using concepts of virtuality and intensive quantities borrowed from Nicole Oresme and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz He presents his conception of the deafening but complicated relationship between mathematics physics and philosophy through a comparison between intuition and discourse sense and speech.

Chatelet is well known in France for his political pamphlet Vivre et penser comme des Porcs De lincitation à lenvie et à lennui dans les démocraties-marchés It was translated and published in English as To Live and Think Like Pigs Envy and Boredom in Market-Economy Democracies.To Live and Think Like Pigs was a polemical essay in which he denounced liberalism which according to him its effectiveness relied on a triple alliance between the tertiary spheres of politics economics and cybernetics or communication technologies.

In a collection of his political writing titled Les Animaux malades he rejected what he considered as a widespread human domestication process imposed by the New World Order. He called for a new philosophy to combat the disastrous effects of the decomposition of both the libertarian optimism and cynicism which in his opinion had become a pseudo-liberal sham.

Quotation from To Think and Live Like Pigs To promote a work without its own temporality totally indentured to the social orderwhether it comes from the whip and from hunger for indentured labour or from the mutilated psychology of the cyberzombie for the overclassa work that cannot be articulated with an intensification of individuation for the great mass of humanity; in short to content oneself with proliferating particular cases of a species is this all that we can now hope for from humanity "
Paul Chauchard,"Paul Chauchard was a French physician and writer of about 80 books. President of laissez-les-vire for 20 years.

Physician and scientist he was professor at the Institut Catholique de Paris and the École pratique des hautes études .

On 1970 he became the first president of the movement Laissez-les-vivre.

He was father of 6 girls one of them is a religious member of Cistercians."
Jacques Chevalier,"Jacques Chevalier was a French Catholic philosopher and a politician.

Chevalier was born in Cérilly Allier educated at the École normale supérieure and the University of Oxford and taught at the Faculty of Letters in Grenoble. He was a specialist of Plato and author of many books mainly about the history of philosophy.

A friend of Lord Halifax he was also a Minister for education in 1941 under the Vichy Regime and was as such the only member of the government to be present at the funeral of the philosopher Henri Bergson. A devout Catholic he attempted to eradicate the anti-religious feeling in educational circles and consequently closed the Écoles Normales which had been created in each département by the François Guizot law of 1833 to prepare teachers for elementary classes replacing them with Instituts de formation professionnelle. The anti-clerical Collaborationists opposed him however and he had to step down ; his reform was eventually abolished and the Écoles Normales were recreated."
Emil Cioran,"Emil Mihai Cioran was a Romanian philosopher and essayist who published works in both Romanian and French. His work has been noted for its pervasive philosophical pessimism style and aphorisms. His works frequently engaged with issues of suffering decay and nihilism. In 1937 Cioran moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris which became his permanent residence wherein he lived in seclusion with his partner Simone Boué.

Cioran was born in Resinár Szeben County Kingdom of Hungary . His father Emilian Cioran was an Orthodox priest and his mother Elvira was the head of the Christian Womens League. 

At 10 Cioran moved to Sibiu to attend school and at 17 he was enrolled in the Faculty of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Bucharest where he met Eugène Ionesco and Mircea Eliade who became his friends. Future Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica and future Romanian thinker Petre Țuțea became his closest academic colleagues; all three studied under Tudor Vianu and Nae Ionescu. Cioran Eliade and Țuțea became supporters of Ionescus ideas known as Trăirism.

Cioran had a good command of German learning the language at an early age and proceeded to read philosophy that was available in German but not in Romanian. Notes from Ciorans adolescence indicated a study of Friedrich Nietzsche Honoré de Balzac Arthur Schopenhauer and Fyodor Dostoevsky among others. He became an agnostic taking as an axiom the inconvenience of existence. While at the University he was influenced by Georg Simmel Ludwig Klages and Martin Heidegger but also by the Russian philosopher Lev Shestov whose contribution to Ciorans central system of thought was the belief that life is arbitrary. Ciorans graduation thesis was on Henri Bergson whom he later rejected claiming Bergson did not comprehend the tragedy of life.

From the age of 20 Cioran began to suffer from insomnia a condition which he suffered from for the rest of his life and permeated his writings. Ciorans decision to write about his experiences in his first book On the Heights of Despair came from an episode of insomnia.

In 1933 he received a scholarship to the University of Berlin where he studied Johann Gottlieb Fichte Hegel Edmund Husserl Immanuel Kant Georg Simmel Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Here he came into contact with Klages and Nicolai Hartmann. While in Berlin he became interested in the policies of the Nazi regime contributed a column to Vremea dealing with the topic and in a letter written to Petru Comarnescu described himself as a Hitlerist. He held similar views about Italian fascism welcoming victories in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War arguing that Fascism is a shock without which Italy is a compromise comparable to todays Romania.

Ciorans first book On the Heights of Despair was published in Romania in 1934. It was awarded the Commissions Prize and the Young Writers Prize for one of the best books written by an unpublished young writer. Regardless Cioran later spoke negatively of it saying it is a very poorly written book without any style.

Successively The Book of Delusions The Transfiguration of Romania and Tears and Saints were also published in Romania. Tears and Saints was incredibly poorly received and after it was published Ciorans mother wrote him asking him to retract the book because it was causing her public embarrassment.

Although Cioran was never a member of the group it was during this time in Romania that he began taking an interest in the ideas put forth by the Iron Guarda far right organization whose nationalist ideology he supported until the early years of World War II despite allegedly disapproving of their violent methods. Cioran would later denounce fascism describing it in 1970 as the worst folly of my youth. If I am cured of one sickness it is surely that one.

Cioran revised The Transfiguration of Romania heavily in its second edition released in the 1990s eliminating numerous passages he considered extremist or pretentious and stupid. In its original form the book expressed sympathy for totalitarianism a view which was also present in various articles Cioran wrote at the time and which aimed to establish urbanization and industrialization as the two obsessions of a rising people.

His early call for modernization was however hard to reconcile with the traditionalism of the Iron Guard. In 1934 he wrote I find that in Romania the sole fertile creative and invigorating nationalism can only be one which does not just dismiss tradition but also denies and defeats it. Disapproval of what he viewed as specifically Romanian traits had been present in his works as well as from various Iron Guard papers.

After returning from Berlin in 1936 Cioran taught philosophy at the Andrei Șaguna High School in Brașov for a year. In 1937 he left for Paris with a scholarship from the French Institute branch in Bucharest which was then prolonged until 1944. After a short stay in his home country Cioran never returned again. This last period in Romania was the one in which he exhibited a closer relationship with the Iron Guard which by then had taken power . On 28 November for the state-owned Romanian Radio Cioran recorded a speech centered on the portrait of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu former leader of the movement praising him and the Guard for among other things having given Romanians a purpose.

He later renounced not only his support for the Iron Guard but also their nationalist ideas and frequently expressed regret and repentance for his emotional implication in it. For example in a 1972 interview he condemned it as a complex of movements; more than this a demented sect and a party saying I found out then I am now immune to it.

Cioran started writing The Passionate Handbook in 1940 and finished it by 1945. It was the last book he wrote in Romanian though not the last to deal with pessimism and misanthropy through lyrical aphorisms. Cioran published books only in French thereafter. It was at this point that Ciorans apparent contempt for the Romanian people emerged. He told a friend that he wanted to write a Philosophy of Failure with the subtitle For the exclusive use of the Romanian People. Furthermore he described his move to Paris as by far the most intelligent thing hed ever done and in The Trouble With Being Born he says In continual rebellion against my ancestry I have spent my whole life wanting to be something else Spanish Russian cannibalanything except what I was.

In 1942 Cioran met Simone Boué another insomniac who he lived with for the rest of his life. Cioran kept their relationship entirely private and never spoke of his relationship with Boué in his writings or interviews.

In 1949 his first French book A Short History of Decay was published by Gallimard and was awarded the Prix Rivarol in 1950 for the best book written by a non-French author. Cioran later refused every literary prize he was given.

The Latin Quarter of Paris became Ciorans permanent residence. He lived most of his life in seclusion avoiding the public but still maintained contact with numerous friends including Mircea Eliade Eugène Ionesco Paul Celan Samuel Beckett Henri Michaux and Fernando Savater.

In 1995 Cioran died of Alzheimers disease and was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery.

Professing a lack of interest in conventional philosophy in his early youth Cioran dismissed abstract speculation in favor of personal reflection and passionate lyricism. I invented nothing. Ive been the one and only secretary of my own sensations he later said.

Aphorisms make up a large portion of Ciorans bibliography and some of his books such as The Trouble with Being Born are composed entirely of aphorisms. Speaking about this decision Cioran said 

I only write this kind of stuff because explaining bores me terribly. Thats why I say when Ive written aphorisms its that Ive sunk back into fatigue why bother. And so the aphorism is scorned by serious people the professors look down upon it. When they read a book of aphorisms they say Oh look what this fellow said ten pages back now hes saying the contrary. Hes not serious. Me I can put two aphorisms that are contradictory right next to each other. Aphorisms are also momentary truths. Theyre not decrees. And I could tell you in nearly every case why I wrote this or that phrase and when. Its always set in motion by an encounter an incident a fit of temper but they all have a cause. Its not at all gratuitous.

Pessimism characterizes all of his works which many critics trace back to events of his childhood . However Ciorans pessimism remains both inexhaustible and in its own particular manner joyful; it is not the sort of pessimism which can be traced back to simple origins single origins themselves being questionable. When Ciorans mother spoke to him of abortion he confessed that it did not disturb him but made an extraordinary impression which led to an insight about the nature of existence .

His works often depict an atmosphere of torment a state that Cioran himself experienced and came to be dominated by lyricism and often the expression of intense and even violent feeling. The books he wrote in Romanian especially display this latter characteristic. Preoccupied with the problems of death and suffering he was attracted to the idea of suicide believing it to be an idea that could help one go on living an idea which he fully explored in On the Heights of Despair. He revisits suicide in depth in The New Gods which contains a section of aphorisms devoted to the subject. The theme of human alienation the most prominent existentialist theme presented by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus is thus formulated in 1932 by young Cioran Is it possible that existence is our exile and nothingness our home in On the Heights of Despair.

Ciorans works encompass many other themes as well original sin the tragic sense of history the end of civilization the refusal of consolation through faith the obsession with the absolute life as an expression of mans metaphysical exile etc. He was a thinker passionate about history; widely reading the writers that were associated with the Decadent movement. One of these writers was Oswald Spengler who influenced Ciorans political philosophy in that he offered Gnostic reflections on the destiny of man and civilization. According to Cioran as long as man has kept in touch with his origins and hasnt cut himself off from himself he has resisted decadence. Today he is on his way to his own destruction through self-objectification impeccable production and reproduction excess of self-analysis and transparency and artificial triumph.

Regarding God Cioran has noted that without Bach God would be a complete second-rate figure and that Bachs music is the only argument proving the creation of the Universe cannot be regarded as a complete failure. Cioran went on to say Bach Shakespeare Beethoven Dostoevsky and Nietzsche are the only arguments against monotheism.

William H. Gass called Ciorans work a philosophical romance on the modern themes of alienation absurdity boredom futility decay the tyranny of history the vulgarities of change awareness as agony reason as disease.

Cioran became most famous while writing not in Romanian but French a language with which he had struggled since his youth. During Ciorans lifetime Saint-John Perse called him the greatest French writer to honor our language since the death of Paul Valéry. Ciorans tone and usage in his adopted language were seldom as harsh as in Romanian .

After the death of Ciorans long-term companion Simone Boué a collection of Ciorans manuscripts were found in the couples apartment by a manager who tried to auction them in 2005. A decision taken by the Court of Appeal of Paris stopped the commercial sale of the collection. However in March 2011 the Court of Appeal ruled that the seller was the legitimate owner of the manuscripts. The manuscripts were purchased by Romanian businessman George Brăiloiu for 405000.

An aged Cioran is the main character in a play by Romanian dramatist-actor Matei Vișniec Mansardă la Paris cu vedere spre moarte . The play depicting an imaginary meeting between Vișniec and Emil Cioran was first brought to the stage in 2007 under the direction of Radu Afrim and with a cast of Romanian and Luxembourgian actors; Cioran was played by Constantin Cojocaru. Stagings were organized in the Romanian city of Sibiu and in the Luxembourg at Esch-sur-Alzette . In 2009 the Romanian Academy granted posthumous membership to Cioran.

Under the rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu Ciorans works were banned. In 1974 Francoist Spain banned The Evil Demiurge for being atheist blasphemous and anti-Christian which Cioran considered one of the greatest jokes in his absurd existence.

Michel Clouscard,"Michel Clouscard was a French Marxist philosopher and sociologist.

An opponent of capitalism a critic of the evolution of ideas of progress confronted with the liberal mutations of the end of the 20th century his work is linked to the thought of Rousseau Hegel and Marx whose links and unity he shows. He is known to have philosophically shown the collusion between capitalism and the French theory represented by Lévi-Strauss and Deleuze constructing his own concept of neo-Kantianism. He developed a philosophical research around the idea of social contract postulating that the constitutive principle of any society is the relation between production and consumption.

His contribution aimed at providing a conceptual basis for thinking about a democratic and self-management political philosophy that would allow for the overcoming of the management of wealth nations and the political education of citizens by the capitalist class.

Clouscards early life was dominated by athletics. He was preselected to compete in the 200 meters race at the 1948 London Olympics.

Clouscards graduate studies in letters and philosophy under the tutelage of Henri Lefebvre culminated with a thesis Being and Code presented to Jean-Paul Sartre among others for defense. Despite Clouscards sharp criticism of the phenomenologist Husserl Sartre commented Being and Code shows a very ambitious undertaking. But in my opinion it is this very ambition that makes the book valid It is a true totalization as it accounts for everything even the individual Its great merit is to show the best conditions for history to reveal itself concretely for what it is an ongoing totalization. This work will give rise to a lifetime of research and writing to develop his work and extend it to the study of French society from 1945 to the present day.

Clouscard was a professor of sociology at the University of Poitiers from 1975 to 1990 where he was influenced by his colleague Jacques DHondt a specialist in Hegel.

In the early Seventies Michel Clouscard developed a critique of libertarian liberalism .

He retired to Gaillac to write the end of his work which is still partly unpublished.

He died during the night of February 2021 2009 at his home from Parkinsons disease.

According to Clouscard the capitalism of seduction with its libertarian liberal face arises from the very evolution of the capitalist mode of production. It testifies to a qualitative jump of the accumulated quantities which at a certain moment reach a libertarian structure of society.

With its libertarian face liberalism achieves its own self-realization until the inevitable catastrophe. Clouscard speaks then about neofascism.

Drawing up the inventory of fixtures of the liberal counter-revolutions consequences Clouscard produced a philosophical work to think and propose the basis of a new social contract and to enable a progressivist re-foundation.

From the beginning of the 1970s Michel Clouscard developed a critique of libertarian liberalism . He studies the change in the socio-economic structure in Europe since 1945 and develops a conceptualization of the new capitalist political economy.

According to him at the time of Karl Marx industry had not reached the stage of light industry which allows the production of the gadget the libidinal object and makes the study of frivolity an essential data to analyze contemporary production. With the appearance of the mode of production of series a qualitative change on the objects and the stakes of the production imposes to develop again the critique of the political economy of Karl Marx. And from then on to understand the ideological inflection of the capitalist society passed from a repressive moral doctrine to a permissive moral doctrine. It is the passage from the austerity imposed to all under the traditional repressive fascism to the austerity of the post-May 68 period where the cultural models have changed the permissiveness serving as a currency to disguise the economic oppression of the working class in the new society of the unfettered enjoyment. The ideological consequences and the contradictions linked to this model prepare a new fascist repression of the contradictions as Pier Paolo Pasolini also pointed out in The Hippies Speech a extremely right-wing fashion of the long-haired.

Clouscard thus understands social evolution as a historical whole in the making. He relates the permissive evolution of social morality to the needs of a new mercantile order of capitalism the need to create new markets and to continue the economic oppression of the working class. He determines the economic and mercantile function of the promotion of new cultural models in advertising ideology to save capitalism in crisis.

Transgressive and libertarian emancipation is not criticized here from the point of view of the individual or civil society as an untouchable monad but as part of a social body. In the logic of a political philosophy of the State the incitement to overthrow the established order by culture and the imagination in power of May 68 without changing the bases of the society allowed the creation of new markets. That is the liberated consumption of goods or services produced through the continued oppression of the working class. According to bourgeois ideologists free enjoyment would lead to the individual freedom of workers playing the game despite the alienation of the fruits of their labor power . A rhetoric of diversion according to this author which brings to light a strategy of management of the social contradictions.

Being and Code is thus the conceptual basis of reference for his later study of French society. The understanding of the codification of the social body according to the being-code relation and through the dialectic of the frivolous and the serious provides the key to freeing the history of France before 1789 from a one-sided celebration of only the progressive aspects of the Enlightenment . On the contrary an examination of the Encyclopedists cautious and measured political conceptions of the Ancien Regime provides an example of their ideological positioning and epistemology especially anthropological. Positivist materialism naturalism is certainly in opposition to the absolutist ideology that is theocracy of divine right but a figure like Voltaire shows the real horizon of the intellectual elites of the bourgeoisie. Indeed on the eve of the French Revolution the bourgeoisie of money and culture managed to share the same libertine culture with the nobility.

For Clouscard the Enlightenment elites certainly carry industrialization and rationalization which will be one of the ideological bases of the end of the political hegemony of the nobility and the clergy. But without real critical discourse on the mode of production of wealth and on social issues. The political background of Diderots team is a constitutional monarchy that is to say a democratic and tax-based rationalization of the management of the relations of domination. This is why Rousseau is isolated The Social Contract clearly claims the Republic. The seizure of power by the Third Estate under the rule of the bourgeoisie is as much the result of the strategy of integration and power sharing as it is the result of an ideological understanding of the ascendant social classes that will assume the management of society. Genesis of the abstract ideological universality of the Human Rights...

In order not to make the obvious misinterpretation of reading his work as hostile to social progress it must be made clear that Clouscard only analyzes how the evolution of the capitalist mode of production and its political survival after 1945 lead to a new consensus between left-libertarians liberals and social democrats which he calls libertarian liberalism. The social contradictions having led to the adoption of a new model of society described by the author in The Metamorphoses of Class Struggle the study of morals is then necessary to account for the mutations of industrialized societies.

His sociological study leads Clouscard to relativize the ideological enthusiasm of the elites of the new intelligentsia that wants to identify the softening of the moral repression of the models of society and the triumph of the soft revolution of the capitalism capable of dissolving the blockings and the inhibitions . The ideological codification exalting the new libertinism of the Sixties is explained in his work by the progressive integration of new social strata the new middle strata to the techno-bureaucratic management system of the new social democratic management of capitalism. The connivance between the intelligentsia of the new left and the new right then expresses the duality of complementarity of the interests and members of the financial bourgeoisie and the new middle strata which are in as ambiguous a situation in relation to the current proletariat as the bourgeoisie of 1789 was with the rest of the Third Estate. In the preface to the second edition of Being and Code the author writes among other things

Thus the critical analysis of the social progress during the 20th century cannot be valid as a moral criticism of the emancipation of women or young people but as a critical analysis of the creation of new markets by the softening of moral repression. The deceptive powers of capitalism precede the individual who attaches himself to models of emancipated behaviors that liberate the body without liberating either the soul or the labor power of the individuals of the Collective Worker forced to exploit themselves to participate in the system of the signs of the enjoyment.

Social struggles are thus exploited and instrumentalized by the very form of society. Aided by the tremendous gains in productivity allowing for the industrial production of subsistence and capital goods the market economy finds commercial outlets for social demands but in a regime of social inequality. The poorest have access to the same cultural models as the richest but while the working class is still exploited to produce and only has access to minimal frivolous consumption sometimes only the most modest signs the new middle and bourgeois strata consume much more without producing and have access to the luxury range of the new products leisure travel luxury organic products marginal and alternative lifestyles moralizing contestation of capitalist relations etc.

Animation and management are the populist and demagogic side of the new libertine culture of the dominant classes which promises enjoyment to the working class and generates a consensual discourse of diversion to demobilize the political fight of the workers. The originality of this ideology is certainly constituted by the abandonment of the great and problematic collective narratives that oblige to take into account the social classes. For the first time the ideological production focuses on creating a collective narrative of the emancipation of the individual within a new libertarian and benevolent society. The problems of work are not addressed from a collective perspective but by targeting the individual. This culture that rejects the class struggle tends to mask or minimize the importance of class differences covers the real by what Clouscard designates and conceptualizes as a seduction resurgence of sophistry for new targets

In his study of the anthropology of modernity Capitalism of seduction Clouscard reveals his critique of the ideology of libertarian social democracy. Written in the wake of the election of François Mitterrand when Jack Lang was Minister of Culture this work gives an account of the new permissive education that shapes the existential and conceptual horizon of youth to bring to the workplace not collective claims but individual delusions. Traditional society assumed participation in laborious tasks and an apprenticeship in work as a principle of reality but the new civilization abolishes the reference to pain and merit in everyday life. In the past emancipation also coincided with integration into the workplace but Clouscard shows that as capitalism targets and develops new markets namely women and young people emancipation begins much younger. He thus denounces the ideological function of worldly feminism the working woman must claim the right to exploitation and denounce her working-class husband as a phallocrat leading to a civil war in the working class. At the same time the young man who consumes without being productive can accuse the working-class father of lacking breadth of vision. A link of symbolic exchange is then established with the objects which condense the ideological promises the phantasmatic of the advertising ideology and the initiation to the civilization of the merchandise the new capitalist civilization produces a new alienation which must thus be studied. The study of the frivolity is determining to understand the new struggle of the classes and Clouscard develops a methodology that criticizes but borrows to the modernity of Lévi-Strauss what will make him say The ones that accepted everything of Lévi-Strauss for whom the system of the kinship is structural of the intersubjectivity will not accept that the occidental intersubjectivity also raises a system of the kinship... . Could it be because the Westerner is more civilized

The overall arrangement is that of a new social contract between debonair bourgeois parents and emancipated but autonomous children. Moreover the soft incitement by the presence of the new goods that are the signs of the look the relational the mechanical animation of the body the emancipating mode of leisure the regulation of the contradictions and the selection of the most resistant 

This mechanism is conceptualized as the emergence within mercantile society of a free distribution of commodities and signs of emancipatory discourses and cultural models but at the cost of the political submission of workers for the immediate and naturalized consumption of the new commodities of light industry capitalism. And for the poorest the consumption of signs of wealth but not of their reality the imaginary is so pervasive the system of cultural meanings so marked out that Clouscard summarizes and conceptualizes the operation as the potlatch of a part of the surplus value in the direction of the working class a marginal share of the surplus value extorted from adult workers served as seed capital for the creation of new markets in the direction of future exploited workers . Through the soft and progressive incentive the new capitalist political economy has gone forward an economy whose commodities and consumption patterns are addictive. Clouscard names this prostitutional economy in the book Refondation progressiste face à la contre-révolution libérale. Above all the potlatch of a share of the surplus value corresponds to the soft oppression of neo-capitalism and tends to complement or even take over from the mere extortion of surplus value which used to describe the objective situation of the working class in twentieth century capitalist society. Victorian morality codified a situation immanent to the objective conditions of austerity while libertarian anti-morality codifies the negation of the proletariat by another part of the working class the new middle classes.

Michel Clouscard denounced this drift of the market economy at a time when the cycle of alternating recession and recovery introduced unemployment and austerity as a structural horizon for workers and in particular for the working class and thus allowed a part of the over-numbered and weakened working class to find an outlet in the leisure industry and the prostitutional economy. In 1983 Clouscard finished Le Capitalisme de la séduction"
Auguste Comte,"Isidore Marie Auguste François Xavier Comte ; 19 January 1798 5 September 1857 was a French philosopher and writer who formulated the doctrine of positivism. He is often regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comtes ideas were also fundamental to the development of sociology; indeed he invented the term and treated that discipline as the crowning achievement of the sciences.

Influenced by the utopian socialist Henri de Saint-Simon Comte developed positive philosophy in an attempt to remedy the social disorder caused by the French Revolution which he believed indicated imminent transition to a new form of society. He sought to establish a new social doctrine based on science which he labelled positivism. He had a major impact on 19th-century thought influencing the work of social thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and George Eliot. His concept of Sociologie and social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer evolving into modern academic sociology presented by Émile Durkheim as practical and objective social research.

Comtes social theories culminated in his Religion of Humanity which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organisations in the 19th century. He may also have coined the word altruisme .

Auguste Comte was born in MontpellierHérault on 19 January 1798. After attending the Lycée Joffre and then the University of Montpellier Comte was admitted to École Polytechnique in Paris. The École Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of republicanism and progress. The École closed in 1816 for reorganization however and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the École Polytechnique reopened he did not request readmission.

Following his return to Montpellier Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his Catholic and monarchist family and set off again for Paris earning money by small jobs.

In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 Rue Bonaparte in Pariss 6th arrondissement and later that year he became a student and secretary to Henri de Saint-Simon who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon LIndustrie Le Politique and LOrganisateur although he would not publish under his own name until 1819s La séparation générale entre les opinions et les désirs .

In 1824 Comte left Saint-Simon again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société . But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.

Comte married Caroline Massin in 1825. In 1826 he was taken to a mental health hospital but left without being cured only stabilized by French alienist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol so that he could work again on his plan . In the time between this and their divorce in 1842 he published the six volumes of his Cours.

Comte developed a close friendship with John Stuart Mill. From 1844 he fell deeply in love with the Catholic Clotilde de Vaux although because she was not divorced from her first husband their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious and Comte working closely with Mill developed a new Religion of Humanity. John Kells Ingram an adherent of Comte visited him in Paris in 1855.

He published four volumes of Système de politique positive . His final work the first volume of La Synthèse Subjective was published in 1856. Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother Rosalie Boyer and of Clotilde de Vaux.His apartment from 1841 to 1857 is now conserved as the Maison dAuguste Comte and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince in Paris 6th arrondissement.

Comte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positive Philosophy a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work A General View of Positivism . The first 3 volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science and classifying the sciences in this way Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term. Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex Queen science of human society itself. His work View of Positivism would therefore set out to define in more detail the empirical goals of the sociological method.

Comte offered an account of social evolution proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general law of three stages.

Comtes stages were the theological stage the metaphysical stage and the positive stage. The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the Age of Enlightenment in which mans place in society and societys restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in supernatural power. Fetishism played a significant role during this time. By the Metaphysical stage Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of Aristotle or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the French Revolution of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of universal rights as being on a vaunted higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of the investigation because people started reasoning and questioning although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of the investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion. In the Scientific stage which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of Napoleon people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of human rights or prophecy of the will of God. Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard he was similar to Karl Marx and Jeremy Bentham. For its time this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date although from a later standpoint it is too derivative of classical physics and academic history. Comtes law of three stages was one of the first theories of social evolutionism.

The other universal law he called the encyclopedic law. By combining these laws Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences including inorganic physics and organic physics . Independently from Emmanuel Joseph Sieyèss introduction of the term in 1780 Comte re-invented sociologie and introduced the term as a neologism in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term social physics but that term had been appropriated by others notably by Adolphe Quetelet.

The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand not how they can be made to stand but how they must stand irrespective of the wishes of anyone...This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called positivity which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This as may be readily seen is also a measure of their relative complexity since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is moreover that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration and therefore mathematics which is not itself a concrete science is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy physics chemistry biology and sociology.

This idea of a special science for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term sociology had already been introduced in 1780 albeit with a different meaning by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès . The ambitious ways that Comte conceived of this special science of the social however was unique. Comte saw this new science sociology as the last and greatest of all sciences one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out however that he noted a seventh science one even greater than sociology. Namely Comte considered Anthropology or true science of Man the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science.

Comtes explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory practice and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of Harriet Martineaus translation of The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte we see his observation that If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them for the most part we could not even perceive them.

Comtes emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern functionalism. Nevertheless as with many others of Comtes time certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition.

His emphasis on a quantitative mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism modern quantitative statistical analysis and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act . Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.

The early sociology of Herbert Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms.

Comtes fame today owes in part to Émile Littré who founded The Positivist Review in 1867. Debates continue to rage however as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor Henri de Saint-Simon.

Auguste Comte did not create the idea of Sociology the study of society patterns of social relationships social interaction and culture but instead he expanded it greatly. Positivism the principle of conducting sociology through empiricism and the scientific method was the primary way that Comte studied sociology. He split sociology into two different areas of study. One social statics how society holds itself together and two social dynamics the study of the causes of societal changes. He saw these areas as parts of the same system. Comte compared society and sociology to the human body and anatomy. Comte ascribed the functions of connection and boundaries to the social structures of language religion and division of labor. Through language everybody in society both past and present can communicate with each other. Religion unites society under a common belief system and functions in harmony under a system. Finally the division of labor allows everyone in the society depends upon each other.

Comte is often disregarded when talking about utopia. However he made many contributions to utopian literature and influenced the modern-day debate. Some intellectuals allude to the fact that the utopian system of modern life served as a catalyst for various world-making activities during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries In this utopian project Comte introduces three major concepts altruism sociocracy and the religion of Humanity. Altruism termed coined by Comte in the 19th century a theory of conduct that regards the good of others as the end of moral action. . Furthermore Comte explains sociocracy as the governance by people who know each other friends or allies. After the French revolution Comte was looking for a rational basis for government after developing the Positivism philosophy he developed sociocracy to the scientific method of the government.

In later years Comte developed the Religion of Humanity for positivist societies to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849 he proposed a calendar reform called the positivist calendar. For close associate John Stuart Mill it was possible to distinguish between a good Comte and a bad Comte . The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwins On the Origin of Species to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comtes English followers including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to vivre pour autrui from which comes the word altruism.

The law is this that each of our leading conceptions each branch of our knowledge passes successively through three different theoretical conditions the Theological or fictitious; the Metaphysical or abstract; and the Scientific or positive.

The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system has lost its power and is preventing the progression of civilization causing complicated situations in society. 10. The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an organic new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment in society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress there need to be the necessary consequences that come with it which is caused by a series of modifications independent of the human will to which all classes of society contributed and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters. The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage metaphysical stage and positive stage.The Law of Three Stages is split into stages much like how the human mind changes from stage to stage. The three stages are the theological stage the metaphysical stage and the positive stage also known as the Law of Three Stages. The theological stage happened before the 1300s in which all societies lived a life that was completely theocentric. The metaphysical stage was when the society seeks universal rights and freedom. With the third and final stage the positive stage Comte takes a stand on the question how should the relations among philosophy of science history of science and sociology of science be seen. He says that sociology and history are not mutually exclusive but that history is the method of sociology thus he calls sociology the final science. This positive stage was to solve social problems and forcing these social problems to be fixed without care for the will of God or human rights. Comte finds that these stages can be seen across different societies across all of history.

The first theological state is the necessary starting point of human intelligence. The human mind primarily focuses its attention on the inner nature of beings and to the first and final causes of all phenomena it observes. This means that the mind is looking for the cause and effect of an action that will govern the social world. Therefore it represents these phenomena as being produced by a direct and continuous action of more or less numerous supernatural agents whose arbitrary interventions explain all the apparent anomalies of the universe. This primary subset of the theological state is known as fetishism where the phenomena must be caused and created by a theological supernatural being such as God making humans view every event in the universe as a direct will from these supernatural agents. Some people believed in souls or spirits that possessed inanimate objects and practiced Animism. These natural spiritual beings who possessed souls and may exist apart from the material bodies were capable of interacting with humans therefore requiring sacrifices and worship to please the agents. With all these new reasons behind phenomena numerous fetishisms occur needing several gods to continue to explain events. People begin to believe that every object or event has a unique god attached to it. This belief is called polytheism. The mind substituted the providential action of a single being for the varied play of numerous independent gods which have been imagined by the primitive mind. These Gods often took on both human and animal resemblance. In Egypt there were multiple gods with animal body parts such as Ra who had the head of a hawk and had sun associations with the Egyptians. The polytheistic Greeks had several gods such as Poseidon who controlled the sea and Demeter who was the goddess of fertility. However with all these new gods governing the phenomena of society the brain can get confused with the numerous gods it needs to remember. The human mind eliminates this problem by believing in a sub-stage called monotheism. Rather than having multiple gods there is simply one all-knowing and omnipotent God who is the center of power controlling the world. This creates harmony with the universe because everything is under one ruler. This leaves no confusion of how to act or who is the superior ruler out of the several gods seen in polytheism. The theological state functions well as the first state of the mind when making a belief about an event because it creates a temporary placeholder for the cause of the action which can later be replaced. By allowing the brain to think of the reason behind phenomena the polytheistic gods are fillers that can be replaced by monotheistic gods. The theological stage shows how the primitive mind views supernatural phenomena and how it defines and sorts the causes. The earliest progress of the human mind could only have been produced by the theological method the only method which can develop spontaneously. It alone has the important property of offering us a provisional theory which immediately groups the first facts with its help by cultivating our capacity for observation we were able to prepare the age of a wholly positive philosophy. 

The Theological Stage is the stage that was seen primarily among the civilizations in the distant past. Having been used before the 1300s this is a very basic view of the world with little to no involvement in the world of science and a world of illusions and delusions as Freud would put it. To seek the nature of all beings mankind puts its focus on sentiments feelings and emotions. This turned mankind towards theology and the creation of gods to answer all their questions.

The final most evolved stage is the positivist stage the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth and turn towards discovering through reasoning and observation actual laws of phenomena. Humans realize that laws exist and that the world can be rationally explained through science rational thought laws and observation. Comte was a positivist believing in the natural rather than the supernatural and so he claimed that his time period the 1800s was in the positivist stage. He believed that within this stage there is a hierarchy of sciences mathematics astronomy terrestrial physics chemistry and physiology. Mathematics the science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes is the most perfect science of all and is applied to the most important laws of the universe. Astronomy is the most simple science and is the first to be subjected to positive theories. Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy because it is more complex having less pure and systemized theories. Physics as well as chemistry are the general laws of the inorganic world and are harder to distinguish. Physiology completes the system of natural sciences and is the most important of all sciences because it is the only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves. This stage will fix the problems in current nations allowing progression and peace.

It is through observation that humanity is able to gather knowledge. The only way within society to gather evidence and build upon what we do not already know to strengthen society is to observe and experience our situational surroundings. In the positive state the mind stops looking for causes of phenomena and limits itself strictly to laws governing them; likewise absolute notions are replaced by relative ones The imperfection of humanity is not a result of the way we think rather our perspective that guides the way we think. Comte expresses the idea that we have to open our eyes to different ideas and ways to evaluate our surroundings such as focusing outside of the simple facts and abstract ideas but instead dive into the supernatural. This does not make mean that what is around us is not critical to look out for as our observations are critical assets to our thinking. The things that are lost or knowledge that is in the past are still relevant to recent knowledge. It is what is before our time that guides why things are the way they are today. We would always be relying on our own facts and would never hypothesize to reveal the supernatural if we do not observe. Observing strives to further our thinking processes. According to Comte The dead govern the living which is likely a reference to the cumulative nature of positivism and the fact that our current world is shaped by the actions and discoveries of those who came before us As this is true the observations only relevant to humanity and not abstractly related to humanity are distinct and seen situationally. The situation leads to human observation as a reflection of the tension in society can be reviewed overall helping to enhance knowledge development. Upon our observation skills our thinking shifts. As thinkers and observers we switch from trying to identify truth and turn toward the rationality and reason nature brings giving us the ability to observe. This distinct switch takes on the transition from the abstract to the supernatural. Comtes classification of the sciences was based upon the hypothesis that the sciences had developed from the understanding of simple and abstract principles to the understanding of complex and concrete phenomena. Instead of taking what we believe to be true we turn it around to use the phenomena of science and the observation of natural law to justify what we believe to be true within society. The condensing and formulation of human knowledge is what Comte drives us toward to ultimately build the strongest society possible. If scientists do not take the chance to research why a certain animal species are going distinct and their facts researched by those in the past are no longer true of the present how is the data supposed to grow How are we to gain more knowledge These facts of life are valuable but it is beyond these facts that Comte gestures us to look to. Instead of the culmination of facts with little sufficiency knowledge altogether takes on its role in the realm of science. In connection to science Comte relates to science in two specific fields to rebuild the construction of human knowledge. As science is broad Comte reveals this scientific classification for the sake of thinking and the future organization of society. Comte divided sociology into two main fields or branches social statistics or the study of the forces that hold society together; and social dynamics or the study of the causes of social change In doing this society is reconstructed. By reconstructing human thinking and observation societal operation alters. The attention is drawn to science hypothesis natural law and supernatural ideas allows sociology to be divided into these two categories. By combining the simple facts from the abstract to the supernatural and switching our thinking towards hypothetical observation the sciences culminate in order to formulate sociology and this new societal division. Every social system aims definitively at directing all special forces towards a general result for the exercise of a general and combined activity is the essence of the society Social phenomena Comte believed can be transferred into laws and that systemization could become the prime guide to sociology so that all can maintain knowledge to continue building a strong intellectual society.

To continue building a strong intellectual society Comte believed the building or reformation requires intricate steps to achieve success. First the new society must be created after the old society is destroyed because withoutdestruction no adequate conception could be formed of what must be done. Essentially a new society cannot be formed if it is constantly hindered by the ghost of its past. On the same terms there will be no room for progress if the new society continues to compare itself to the old society. If humanity does not destroy the old society the old society will destroy humanity.

Or on the other hand if one destroys the old society without ever replacing it the people march onwards towards total anarchy. If the society is continuously chipped away without being replaced with new ideal societal structures then society will fall deeper back into its old faults. The burdens will grow deep and entangle the platforms for the new society thus prohibiting progress and ultimately fulfilling the cursed seesaw of remodeling and destroying society. Hence according to Comte to design a successful new society one must keep the balance of reconstruction and deconstruction. This balance allows for progress to continue without fault.

Auguste Comte is well known for writing in his book The Positive Philosophy that people would never learn the chemical composition of the stars. This has been called a very poor prediction regarding human limits in science. In thirty years people were beginning to learn the composition of stars through spectroscopy."
André Comte-Sponville,"André Comte-Sponville is a French philosopher.

André Comte-Sponville was born in Paris France. He studied in the École Normale Supérieure and earned a PhD from Panthéon-Sorbonne University and is aggregated in philosophy. He is a proponent of atheism and materialism but in a particular form because of his spiritualistic aim.

The most important aspect of his work is an overcoming of traditional materialistic atheism in a perspective of post-materialism because he demonstrates a spiritualization of atheism. This is especially present in his essay Lesprit de lathéisme"
Marcel Conche,"Marcel Conche is a French philosopher and emeritus professor at the Sorbonne University .

A recent publication the Tao Te Ching translation and comments in French follows the format of previous works such as Héraclite - Fragments 

In this book he draws an interesting parallel between the nearly contemporaries Lao Zi and Heraclitus the river of the Greek is compared to the Dao of the Chinese.

In some cases the text is reordered to follow a more logical order from the simplest of principles to the most advanced."
William of Conches,"William of Conches was a French scholastic philosopher who sought to expand the bounds of Christian humanism by studying secular works of the classics and fostering empirical science. He was a prominent member of the School of Chartres. John of Salisbury a bishop of Chartres and former student of Williams refers to William as the most talented grammarian after Bernard of Chartres.

He was born in Conches Normandy. His teaching activity extended from c. 1120 to 1154 and about the year 1145 he became the tutor of Henry Plantagenet. It is possible but uncertain that he was teaching at Chartres before that. Warned by a friend of the danger implied in his Platonic realism as he applied it to theology he took up the study of Islamic philosophy and physical science. When and where he died is a matter of uncertainty.

William devoted much attention to cosmology and psychology. Having been a student of Bernard of Chartres he shows the characteristic Humanism tendency towards Platonism and taste for natural science which distinguish the Chartrains. He is one of the first of the medieval Christian philosophers to take advantage of Islamic physical and physiological lore to which he had access in the translations by Constantine the African.

William of St. Thierry who had encouraged Bernard of Clairvaux to prosecute Abelard in another letter to Bernard attacked Williams De philosophia mundi for having a modalist view of the Holy Trinity. William in consequence revised some controversial parts in the Dragmaticon.

There is a good deal of discussion regarding the authorship of the works ascribed to William. It seems probable however that he wrote the encyclopedic De philosophia mundi and the related dialogue Dragmaticon as well as glosses on Platos Timaeus on Boethiuss Consolation of Philosophy on Priscians Institutiones grammaticae and on Macrobiuss Commentary on the Dream of Scipio. He was probably also the author of a lost treatise Magna de naturis philosophia. A work on ethics the Moralium dogma philosophorum was attributed to him in the 1920s but his authorship is now rejected by most scholars.

The De philosophia mundi is divided into four books covering physics astronomy geography meteorology and medicine.

William explains the world as composed of elements which he defines as the simplest and minimum part of any bodysimple in quality minimum in quantity. He identifies the elements with the traditional four elements but not as they are perceived since as such they are neither simple in quality nor minimum in quantity earth for example contains something hot something cold something dry and something wet at the same time. Pure elements are not to be perceived says William but to be grasped by reason through an abstract division of the sensible bodies. Each of these pure elements has two of the four basic qualities earth is cold and dry water is cold and humid air is hot and humid and fire is hot and dry. The perceivable elements called elementata are made of pure elements the sensible earth especially of pure earth the sensible water especially of pure water and so on.

The discussion of meteorology includes a description of air becoming less dense and colder as the altitude increases and William attempts to explain the circulation of the air in connection with the circulation of the oceans. The discussion of medicine deals chiefly with procreation and childbirth. This work influenced Jean de Meung the author of the second part of the Roman de la Rose."
Étienne Bonnot de Condillac,"He was born at Grenoble into a legal family the youngest of three brothers. His two older brothers Jean and Gabriel took names associated with one of the familys properties at Mably Loire and were each known as Bonnot de Mably. Étienne identified with another property at Condillac Drôme was known as Bonnot de Condillac. Like his brother Gabriel Condillac took holy orders at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris. He was appointed as Abbot of Mureau.

Condillac devoted his whole life with the exception of an interval as a court-appointed tutor to the court of Parma to speculative thought. His works are

In Paris Condillac was involved with the circle of Denis Diderot the philosopher who was co-contributor to the Encyclopédie. He developed a friendship with Jean-Jacques Rousseau which lasted in some measure to the end of his life. It likely started when Rousseau was a tutor to two of his brother Jeans sons in LyonJean Bonnot de Mably was then provost of the police and known as Monsieur de Mably. Together with his brother Gabriel who became the well-known political writer known as Abbé de Mably Condillac introduced Rousseau to an intellectual circle.

Condillacs relations with unorthodox philosophers did not injure his career. He had already published several works when the French court sent him to Parma to educate the orphan duke then a child of seven years.

On his return from Italy Condillac was elected to the Académie française in 1768. Contrary to the popular idea that he attended only one meeting he was a frequent attendee until two years before his death. He spent his later years in retirement at Flux a small property which he had purchased near Beaugency on the river Loire. He died there on 2 or 3 August 1780.

Condillac is important both as a psychologist and as having established systematically in France the principles of John Locke. Voltaire had made the English philosopher fashionable. Condillac developed his concept of empirical sensationism and demonstrated lucidity brevity moderation and an earnest striving after logical method.

His first book the Essai sur lorigine des connaissances humaines keeps close to his English master. He accepts with some reluctance Lockes deduction of our knowledge from two sources sensation and reflection. He uses as his main principle of explanation the association of ideas.

His next book the Traité des systèmes is a vigorous criticism of those modern systems which are based upon abstract principles or upon unsound hypotheses. His polemic which is inspired throughout by Locke is directed against the innate ideas of the Cartesians Malebranches faculty-psychology Leibnizs monadism and pre-established harmony and above all against the conception of substance set forth in the first part of the Ethics of Baruch Spinoza.

By far the most important of his works is the Traité des sensations in which Condillac treats psychology in his own characteristic way. He questioned Lockes doctrine that the senses give us intuitive knowledge of objects that the eye for example naturally judges shapes sizes positions and distances. He believed it was necessary to study the senses separately to distinguish precisely what ideas are owed to each sense to observe how the senses are trained and how one sense aids another. He believed that the conclusion has to be that all human faculty and knowledge are transformed sensation only to the exclusion of any other principle such as reflection.

The author imagines a statue organized inwardly like a man animated by a soul which has never received an idea into which no sense-impression has ever penetrated. He unlocks its senses one by one beginning with smell as the sense that contributes least to human knowledge. At its first experience of smell the consciousness of the statue is entirely occupied by it; and this occupancy of consciousness is attention. The statues smell-experience will produce pleasure or pain; and pleasure and pain will thenceforward be the master-principle which determining all the operations of its mind will raise it by degrees to all the knowledge of which it is capable. The next stage is memory which is the lingering impression of the smell experience upon the attention memory is nothing more than a mode of feeling. From memory springs comparison the statue experiences the smell say of a rose while remembering that of a carnation; and comparison is nothing more than giving ones attention to two things simultaneously. And as soon as the statue has comparison it has judgment. Comparisons and judgments become habitual are stored in the mind and formed into series and thus arises the powerful principle of the association of ideas. From comparison of past and present experiences in respect of their pleasure-giving quality arises desire; it is desire that determines the operation of our faculties stimulates the memory and imagination and gives rise to the passions. The passions also are nothing but sensation transformed.

These indications will suffice to show the general course of the argument in the first section of the Traité des sensations. He thoroughly developed this idea through the subsequent chapters Of the Ideas of a Man limited to the Sense of Smell Of a Man limited to the Sense of Hearing Of Smell and Hearing combined Of Taste by itself and of Taste combined with Smell and Hearing Of a Man limited to the Sense of Sight.

In the second section of the treatise Condillac invests his statue with the sense of touch which first informs it of the existence of external objects. In a very careful and elaborate analysis he distinguishes the various elements in our tactile experiences-the touching of ones own body the touching of objects other than ones own body the experience of movement the exploration of surfaces by the hands he traces the growth of the statues perceptions of extension distance and shape. The third section deals with the combination of touch with the other senses. The fourth section deals with the desires activities and ideas of an isolated man who enjoys possession of all the senses; and ends with observations on a wild boy who was found living among bears in the forests of Lithuania.

The conclusion of the whole work is that in the natural order of things everything has its source in sensation and yet that this source is not equally abundant in all men; men differ greatly in the degree of vividness with which they feel. Finally he says that man is nothing but what he has acquired; all innate faculties and ideas are to be swept away. Modern theories of evolution and heredity have differed from this.

Condillacs work on politics and history in his Cours détudes is considered of less interest. In logic on which he wrote extensively he is far less successful than in psychology. He enlarges with much iteration on the supremacy of the analytic method; argues that reasoning consists in the substitution of one proposition for another which is identical with it; and lays it down that science is the same thing as a well-constructed language a proposition which in his Langue des calculs he tries to prove by the example of arithmetic. His logic is limited by his study of sensations and lack of knowledge of science other than mathematics. He rejects the medieval apparatus of the syllogism; but is precluded by his standpoint from understanding the active spiritual character of thought; nor had he that interest in natural science and appreciation of inductive reasoning which form the chief merit of JS Mill. Some might claim that Condillacs anti-spiritual psychology with its explanation of personality as an aggregate of sensations leads straight to atheism and determinism. However he denies both these consequences. What he says upon religion is always in harmony with his profession; and he vindicated the freedom of the will in a dissertation that has very little in common with the Traité des sensations to which it is appended. The common reproach of materialism should certainly not be made against him. He always asserts the substantive reality of the soul; and in the opening words of his Essai Whether we rise to heaven or descend to the abyss we never get outside ourselvesit is always our own thoughts that we perceive we have the subjectivist principle that forms the starting-point of Berkeley.

Condillac considered language as the vehicle by which senses and emotions were transformed into higher mental faculties. He believed that the structure of language reflects the structure of thought and compared ideas to the sounds of a harpsichord. His theories had a major effect on the development of linguistics.

Condillac promoted sensationalism a theory that says all knowledge comes from the senses and there are no innate ideas. Condillac promoted an expressionist theory of linguistic creation that anticipates the prime features of later thoughts about language by German theorist Johann Gottfried Herder .

Condillacs Le Commerce et le Gouvernement attempted to place economics in a coherent logical framework. He was a friend of François Quesnay leader of the Physiocrats. Much of Condillacs work reflected mainstream Physiocrats particularly his analysis of the structure of taxation and proposals for the revival of the economy but he also proposed another line of argument claiming that producers work to obtain utility. Most physiocrats rejected utility and the idea was ignored until his rediscovery by Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger in 1871.

In his theory of vrai prix Condillac proposed a theory of human history divided into two phases progress and decline. Progress is marked by a rational development and use of resources; decline is precipitated by bad behavior from the upper classes that then trickles down to the workers encouraging excess luxury and false prices that harm the masses. Condillac saw the remedy to this as vrai prix a true price created by the unimpeded interaction of supply and demand to be achieved by complete deregulation. People would be taught to work toward their best interest in an open market through a reshaping of their perceptions. By advocating of a free market economy in contrast to the prevailing contemporary policy of state control in France Condillac influenced classical liberal economics.

Condillacs Histoire ancienne and Histoire moderne demonstrated how the experience and observation of the past aided man. History was not a mere retelling of the past but a source of information and inspiration as well. Reason and critical thinking can improve mans lot and destroy superstition and fanaticism. History thus served as a moral political and philosophical textbook which taught man to live better. Thus the two histories present the basic program of the Enlightenment in crystallized form.

As was fitting to a disciple of Locke Condillacs ideas have had most importance in their effect upon English thought. In matters connected with the association of ideas the supremacy of pleasure and pain and the general explanation of all mental contents as sensations or transformed sensations his influence can be traced upon the Mills and upon Bain and Herbert Spencer. And apart from any definite propositions Condillac did a notable work in the direction of making psychology a science; it is a great step from the desultory genial observation of Locke to the rigorous analysis of Condillac short-sighted and defective as that analysis may seem to us in the light of fuller knowledge.

His method however of imaginative reconstruction was by no means suited to English ways of thinking. In spite of his protests against abstraction hypothesis and synthesis his allegory of the statue is in the highest degree abstract hypothetical and synthetic. James Mill who stood more by the study of concrete realities put Condillac into the hands of his youthful son with the warning that here was an example of what to avoid in the method of psychology. A modern historian has compared Condillac with Scottish Enlightenment philosopher and pre-evolutionary thinker Lord Monboddo who had a similar fascination with abstraction and ideas. In France Condillacs doctrine so congenial to the tone of 18th century philosophism reigned in the schools for over fifty years challenged only by a few who like Maine de Biran saw that it gave no sufficient account of volitional experience. Early in the 19th century the romantic awakening of Germany had spread to France and sensationism was displaced by the eclectic spiritualism of Victor Cousin.

Condillacs collected works were published in 1798 and two or three times subsequently; the last edition has an introductory dissertation by A. F. Théry. The Encyclopédie méthodique has a very long article on Condillac by Naigeon. Biographical details and criticism of the Traité des systèmes in J. P.

Marquis de Condorcet,"Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Marquis of Condorcet known as Nicolas de Condorcet was a French philosopher and mathematician. His ideas including support for a liberal economy free and equal public instruction constitutional government and equal rights for women and people of all races have been said to embody the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment of which he has been called the last witness and Enlightenment rationalism. He died in prison after a period of flight from French Revolutionary authorities.

Condorcet was born in Ribemont descended from the ancient family of Caritat who took their title from the town of Condorcet in Dauphiné of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age he was taken care of by his devoutly religious mother who raised him as a girl till age nine. He was educated at the Jesuit College in Reims and at the Collège de Navarre in Paris where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in mathematics. When he was sixteen his analytical abilities gained the praise of Jean le Rond dAlembert and Alexis Clairaut; soon Condorcet would study under dAlembert.

From 1765 to 1774 he focused on science. In 1765 he published his first work on mathematics entitled Essai sur le calcul intégral which was well received launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers and on 25 February 1769 he was elected to the Académie royale des Sciences.

In 1772 he published another paper on integral calculus. Soon after he met Jacques Turgot a French economist and the two became friends. Turgot became an administrator under King Louis XV in 1772 and Controller-General of Finance under Louis XVI in 1774.

Condorcet worked with Leonhard Euler and Benjamin Franklin. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies including the American Philosophical Society the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and also in Prussia and Russia.

His political ideas many in congruity with Turgots were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world however most notably by John Adams who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgots and Condorcets unicameral legislature and radical democracy.

In 1774 Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the Paris mint by Turgot. From this point on Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years he took up the defense of human rights in general and of womens and Blacks rights in particular . He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States and proposed projects of political administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.

In 1776 Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the Monnaie but the request was refused and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote Vie de M. Turgot a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgots economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments in 1777 he became Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences holding the post until the abolition of the Académie in 1793; and in 1782 secretary of the Académie française.

In 1785 Condorcet published his Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions one of his most important works. This work described several now famous results including Condorcets jury theorem which states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases and Condorcets paradox which shows that majority preferences can become intransitive with three or more options it is possible for a certain electorate to express a preference for A over B a preference for B over C and a preference for C over A all from the same set of ballots.

The paper also outlines a generic Condorcet method designed to simulate pair-wise elections between all candidates in an election. He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by Jean-Charles de Borda . Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the social sciences.

In 1781 Condorcet wrote a pamphlet Reflections on Negro Slavery in which he denounced slavery. In 1786 Condorcet worked on ideas for the differential and integral calculus giving a new treatment of infinitesimals a work which apparently was never published. In 1789 he published Vie de Voltaire which agreed with Voltaire in his opposition to the Church. In 1791 Condorcet along with Sophie de Grouchy Thomas Paine Etienne Dumont Jacques-Pierre Brissot and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled Le Républicain its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journals theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.

In 1795 Condorcets book Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind was published after his death by his wife Sophie de Grouchy. It dealt with theoretical thought on perfecting the human mind and analyzing intellectual history based on social arithmetic.Thomas Malthus wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population partly in response to Condorcets views on the perfectibility of society.

Condorcet took a leading role when the French Revolution swept France in 1789 hoping for a rationalist reconstruction of society and championed many liberal causes. As a result in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the Legislative Assembly and then became the secretary of the Assembly.

Condorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the National Convention however due to his distaste for their factionalism.

In April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system aiming to create a hierarchical system under the authority of experts who would work as the guardians of the Enlightenment and who independent of power would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to republican and egalitarian virtues handing the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants and Condorcets proposal was not taken up by the Assembly. Several years later in 1795 when the Thermidorians had gained in strength the National Convention would adopt an educational plan based on Condorcets proposal.

He advocated womens suffrage for the new government writing an article for Journal de la Société de 1789 and by publishing De ladmission des femmes au droit de cité in 1790.

At the Trial of Louis XVI in December 1792 Condorcet who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the trial itself spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention he proposed to send the king to the galleys.

Condorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the Girondin constitutional project. This constitution was not put to a vote. When the Montagnards gained control of the Convention they wrote their own the French Constitution of 1793. Condorcet criticized the new work and as a result he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793 a warrant was issued for Condorcets arrest.

The warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for five months in the house of Mme. Vernet on Rue Servandoni in Paris. It was there that he wrote Esquisse dun tableau historique des progrès de lesprit humain which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences shows the intimate connection between scientific progress and the development of human rights and justice and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.

On 25 March 1794 Condorcet convinced he was no longer safe left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of Jean-Baptiste Suard a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772 but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later he was arrested in Clamart and imprisoned in Bourg-la-Reine where after another two days he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend Pierre Jean George Cabanis gave him a poison which he eventually used. However some historians believe that he may have been murdered . Jean-Pierre Brancourt claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of Datura stramonium and opium.

Condorcet was symbolically interred in the Panthéon in 1989 in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcets role as a central figure in the Enlightenment. His coffin however was empty as his remains originally interred in the common cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine were lost during the nineteenth century.

In 1786 Condorcet married Sophie de Grouchy who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day became an accomplished salon hostess as Madame de Condorcet and also an accomplished translator of Thomas Paine and Adam Smith. She was intelligent and well educated fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794 it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter Louise Eliza Alexandrine.

Condorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822 never having remarried and having published all her husbands works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza wife of former United Irishman Arthur OConnor. The Condorcet-OConnors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.

Condorcets work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790 he published Sur ladmission des femmes au droit de cité in which he strongly advocated for womens suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous Enlightenment thinkers at the time he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal.

A visionary he identified gender as a social construction based on perceived differences in sex and rejected biological determinism as being able to explain gender relations in society. He denounced patriarchal norms of oppression present at every institutional level and continuously subjugating and marginalising women. Like fellow Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book Emile ou De lEducation Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education. He saw it as the only solution for women to deconstruct gender roles and promote another kind of masculinity not based on violence virility and the subjugation of women but rather on shared attributes such as reason and intelligence. In her book Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism Hooks calls this new concept feminine masculinity new models of selfassertion that do not require the construction of an enemy other be it a woman or the symbolic feminine for them to define themselves against.

Condorcets whole plea for gender equality is founded on the recognition that the attribution of rights and authority comes from the false assumption that men possess reason and women do not. This is according to Nall an obvious example of an individual practising and advocating this feminist masculinity. As such women should enjoy the same fundamental natural right.

Condorcets Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom material affluence and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities showing that humanitys present state and those through which it has passed are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences no less certain no less secure from political revolutions; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature. He was innovative in suggesting that scientific medicine might in the future significantly extend the human life span perhaps even indefinitely such that future humans only die of accident murder and suicide rather than simply old age or disease.Nick Bostrom has thus described him as an early transhumanist.

Condorcets writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcets writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for anybody to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed.

However Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race religion culture or gender. To this end he became a member of the French Société des Amis des Noirs . He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.

Condorcet was also a strong proponent of womens civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable than average men such as Queen Elizabeth and Maria-Theresa.

For Condorcets republicanism the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent all citizens including women had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens not revolutionaries.

Rothschild argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy voting and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to proto-utilitarian theories; he considered individual independence which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions for example between French German and English-Scottish thought and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcets criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.

The Lycée Condorcet in the rue du Havre in the 9th arrondissement of Paris is named in his honour as are streets in many French cities."
Victor Prosper Considerant,"Victor Prosper Considerant was a French utopian socialist philosopher and economist who was a disciple of Charles Fourier.

Considerant was born in Salins-les-Bains Jura and studied at the École Polytechnique . Subsequently working as a musician he collaborated with Fourier on newspapers. He edited the journals La Phalanstère and La Phalange.

Considerant wrote much in advocacy of his principles of which the most important is La Destinée Sociale. He authored Democracy Manifesto which preceded by five years the similar Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels. Considerant defined the notion of a right to work which would be one of the main ideas of French socialists in the 1848 Revolutions. He is also known for having devised the proportional representation system. He also advocated such measures of direct democracy as referendum and recall.

The failure of an insurrection against Louis Napoléon obliged Considerant to go into exile in Belgium in June 1849. On an invitation by Albert Brisbane and helped by Jean-Baptiste Godin between 1855 and 1857 he founded the colony La Réunion in Texas on Fouriers principles.

He was a member of the First International founded in 1864 and took part in the 1871 Paris Commune.

Contrary to a common error his name is not written Considérant as he explained ... there is no acute accent on my e. I have fought in vain for more than sixty years ever since my name was printed to defend it "
Benjamin Constant,"Henri-Benjamin Constant de Rebecque or simply Benjamin Constant was a Swiss-French political thinker activist and writer on political theory and religion.

A committed republican from 1795 he backed the coup détat of 18 Fructidor and the following one on 18 brumaire . During the Consulat in 1800 he became the leader of the Liberal Opposition. Having upset Napoleon and left France to go to Switzerland then to the Kingdom of Saxony he nonetheless sided with Napoleon during the Hundred Days and became politically active again during the French Restoration. He was elected Député in 1818 and remained in post until his death in 1830. Head of the Liberal opposition known as Indépendants he was one of the most notable orators of the Chamber of Deputies of France as a proponent of the parliamentary system. During the July Revolution he was a supporter of Louis Philippe I ascending the throne.

Besides his numerous essays on political and religious themes Constant also wrote on romantic love. His autobiographical Le Cahier rouge gives an account of his love for Madame de Staël whose protégé and collaborator he became especially in the Coppet circle and a successful novella Adolphe .

He was a fervent classical liberal of the early 19th century. He refined the concept of liberty defining it as a condition of existence that allowed the individual to turn away interference from the state or society. His ideas influenced the Trienio Liberal movement in Spain the Liberal Revolution of 1820 in Portugal the Greek War of Independence the November uprising in Poland the Belgian Revolution and liberalism in Brazil and Mexico.

Henri-Benjamin Constant was born in Lausanne to the Constant de Rebecque family descendants of French Huguenots who had fled from Artois to Switzerland during the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century. His father Jules Constant de Rebecque served as a high-ranking officer in the Dutch States Army like his grandfather his uncle and his cousin Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque. When Constants mother Henriette-Pauline de Chandieu-Villars died soon after his birth both his grandmothers took care of him. Private tutors educated him in Brussels and in the Netherlands . While at the Protestant University of Erlangen he gained access to the court of Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He had to leave after an affair with a girl and moved to the University of Edinburgh. There he lived at the home of Andrew Duncan and was befriended by James Mackintosh and Malcolm Laing. When he left the city he promised to pay back his gambling debts.

In 1787 he returned to continental Europe travelling on horseback through Scotland and England. In those years European nobility with their prerogatives come under heavy attack from those like Constant who were influenced by Rousseaus Discourse on Inequality. Constants family criticized him for leaving out part of his last name. In Paris at the home of Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard he became acquainted with Isabelle de Charriere a 46-year-old Dutch woman of letters who later helped publish Rousseaus Confessions and who knew his uncle David-Louis Constant de Rebecque extremely well by virtue of a 15-year correspondence. While he stayed at her home in Colombier Switzerland together they wrote an epistolary novel. She acted as a maternal mentor to him until Constants appointment to the court of Charles William Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel that required him to move north. He left the court when the War of the First Coalition began in 1792.

In Braunschweig he married Wilhelmina von Cramm but she divorced him in 1793. In September 1794 he met and became interested in the famous and wealthy already married Germaine de Staël herself brought up on the principles of Rousseau. They both admired Jean Lambert Tallien and Talleyrand. Their intellectual collaboration between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of the time.

After the Reign of Terror in France Constant became an advocate of bicameralism and of an assembly like the Parliament of Great Britain. In revolutionary France this strand of political thought resulted in the Constitution of the Year III the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients. In 1799 after 18 Brumaire Constant was reluctantly appointed on the insistence of Abbe Sieyes by Napoleon Bonaparte to the Tribunat despite grave reservations on the latters part. Eventually in 1802 the first consul confirmed in his doubts forced Constant to withdraw because of the tenor of his speeches and his close connection with Mme de Staël.

Constant became acquainted with Julie Talma the salonnière wife of actor François-Joseph Talma who wrote many letters to him of compelling human interest.

In 1800 the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise an attempt to assassinate Napoleon failed. In 1803 at a time when Britain and France were at peace Jean Gabriel Peltier while living in England argued that Napoleon should be assassinated. The lawyer James Mackintosh defended the French refugee Peltier against a libel suit instigated by Napoleon then First Consul of France. Mackintoshs speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Staël. She was forced to leave Paris as a result.

De Staël disappointed by French rationalism became interested in German romanticism. She and Constant set out for Prussia and Saxony and travelled with her two children to Weimar. Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel welcomed them the day after their arrival. In Weimar they met Friedrich von Schiller. Due to illness Johann Wolfgang Goethe at first hesitated. In Berlin they met August Wilhelm Schlegel and his brother Friedrich Schlegel. Constant left de Staël in Leipzig and in 1806 lived in Rouen and Meulan where he started work on his novel Adolphe. In 1808 he secretly married Caroline von Hardenberg a woman who had been divorced twice . He moved back to Paris in 1814 where the French Restoration took place and Louis XVIII had become king. As a member of the Council of State Constant proposed a constitutional monarchy. He became friends with Madame Récamier while he fell out with Germaine de Staël who had asked him to pay back his gambling debts when their daughter Albertine married Victor de Broglie. During the Hundred Days of Napoleon who had become more liberal Constant fled to the Vendée but returned when he was invited several times to the Tuileries to set up changes for the Charter of 1815.

After the Battle of Waterloo Constant moved to London with his wife. In 1817 the year when Madame de Staël died he was back in Paris and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies the lower legislative house of the Restoration-era government. One of its most eloquent orators he became a leader of the parliamentary bloc first known as the Independents and later as liberals. He became an opponent of Charles X of France during the Restorationbetween 1815 and 1830.

In 1822 Goethe praised Constant in the following terms

I spent many instructive evenings with Benjamin Constant. Whoever recollects what this excellent man accomplished in years and with what zeal he advanced without wavering along the path which once chosen was forever followed realizes what noble aspirations as yet undeveloped were fermenting within him.

In 1830 King Louis Philippe I gave Constant a large sum of money to help him pay off his debts and appointed him to the Conseil dEtat. Constant is said to have fathered Albertine de Staël-Holstein who later married Victor de Broglie . Constant died in Paris on 8 December 1830 and was buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery.

One of the first thinkers to go by the name of liberal Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large mercantile society. He drew a distinction between the Liberty of the Ancients and the Liberty of the Moderns. The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty which gave the citizens the right to influence politics directly through debates and votes in the public assembly. To support this degree of participation citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous male societies in which they could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.

The Liberty of the Moderns in contrast was based on the possession of civil liberties the rule of law and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited a necessary consequence of the size of modern states and also the inevitable result of having created a mercantile society in which there were no slaves but almost everybody had to earn a living through work. Instead the voters would elect representatives who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from daily political involvement.

He criticised several aspects of the French Revolution and the failures of the social and political upheaval. He stated how the French attempted to apply ancient republican liberties to a modern state. Constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between a persons private life and that of state interference. He praised the noble spirit of regenerating the state. However he stated that it was naïve for writers to believe that two thousand years had not brought some changes in the customs and needs of the people. The dynamics of the state had changed. Ancient populations paled in comparison to the size of modern countries. He even argued that with a large population man had no role in government regardless of its form or type. Constant emphasised how citizens in ancient states found more satisfaction in the public sphere and less in their private lives whereas modern people favoured their private life.

Constants repeated denunciation of despotism pervaded his critique of French political philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Abbé de Mably. These writers influential in the French Revolution according to Constant mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of the state. Alleged reformers used the model of public force of the Ancien Régime and organised the most absolute despotism in the name of the Republic. He continually condemned despotism citing the contradiction of a liberty derived from despotism and the vacuous nature of this ideology.

Furthermore he pointed out the detrimental nature of the Reign of Terror as an inexplicable delirium. In François Furets words Constants entire political thought revolved around this question namely the problem of how to justify the Terror. Constant understood the revolutionaries disastrous over-investment in the political sphere. The French revolutionaries such as the Sans-culottes were the primary force in the streets. They promoted constant vigilance in public. Constant pointed out how despite the most obscure life the quietest existence the most unknown name it offered no protection during the Reign of Terror. The pervasive mob mentality deterred many right thinking people and helped to usher in despots such as Napoleon.

Moreover Constant believed that in the modern world commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleons belligerence on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to rely on war whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would tend to be at peace with all other peaceful nations.

Constant believed that if liberty were to be salvaged from the aftermath of the Revolution then the chimera of Ancient Liberty had to be reconciled with the practical to achieve Modern Liberty. England since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the United Kingdom after 1707 had demonstrated the practicality of Modern Liberty and Britain was a constitutional monarchy. Constant concluded that constitutional monarchy was better suited than republicanism to maintaining Modern Liberty. He was instrumental in drafting the Acte Additional of 1815 which transformed Napoleons restored rule into a modern constitutional monarchy. This was only to last for One Hundred Days before Napoleon was defeated but Constants work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty. Indeed the French Constitution of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of Constants ideas a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected Chamber of Deputies and a senatorial Chamber of Peers with the executive power vested in responsible ministers. Thus although often ignored in France because of his Anglo-Saxon sympathies Constant succeeded in contributing in a profound way to French constitutional traditions.

Secondly Constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power protecting balancing and restraining the excesses of the other active powers . This was an advance on the prevailing theory in the English-speaking world which following the opinion of William Blackstone the 18th-century English jurist had regarded the King as head of the executive branch. In Constants scheme the executive power would be entrusted to a Council of Ministers who although appointed by the King were ultimately accountable to Parliament. In making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the King and the ministers Constant was responding to the political reality which had become apparent in Britain for more than a century that is the ministers and not the King are responsible actors and the King reigns but does not rule. This was important for the development of parliamentary government in France and elsewhere. The King was not to be a powerless cipher in Constants scheme. He would have many powers including the power to make judicial appointments to dissolve the Chamber and call new elections to appoint the peers and to dismiss ministers but he would not be able to govern make policy or direct the administration since that would be the task of the responsible ministers. This theory was literally applied in Portugal and Brazil where the KingEmperor was explicitly given Moderating Powers rather than executive power. Elsewhere the executive power was notionally vested in the King but was exercised only by the responsible ministers.

He advocated the separation of powers as a basis for a liberal State but unlike Montesquieu and most of the liberal thinkers he advocated five powers instead of three. They were

Thus the Moderating Power was a monarch a type of judge who was not part of government but served as a neutral power to the government the Executive Power was vested in the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were collectively the head of government the Representative Powers were a separation of the Monstesquieus Legislative power with the Representative Power of Opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizenry and the Representative Power of Tradition was a hereditary House of Peers and the judiciary was similar to the Montesquieus Judicial Power.

Constants other concerns included a new type of federalism a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to elected municipal councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831 when elected municipal councils were created.

Aside from his political and literary output Constant spent forty years working on religion and religious feeling. His publications demonstrate his desire to grasp this social phenomenon inherent to human nature which in whatever forms it may present is always a search for perfectibility. If its manifestations become rigid splitting becomes inevitable. Thus however religious feeling may present it needs to adapt and evolve.

Constant is adamant that political authority should not meddle in the religious beliefs of the citizenry even to defend them. In his view it is up to each person to decide where to seek their consolation moral compass or faith. External authority cannot act upon someones convictions it can only act upon their interests. He also condemns a religion that is commonly regarded as utilitarian since it degrades authentic religious feeling.

He considers that it was necessary for polytheism to decline in line with human progress. The more humans progress in their understanding the more beneficial the effects of theism. Belief in a god has itself evolved. Christianity especially protestantism is he argues its most tolerant form and an indicator of intellectual moral and spiritual evolution.

Constant published only one novel during his lifetime Adolphe the story of a young indecisive mans disastrous love affair with an older mistress. A first-person novel in the sentimentalist tradition Adolphe examines the thoughts of the young man as he falls in and out of love with Ellenore a woman of uncertain virtue. Constant began the novel as an autobiographical tale of two loves but decided that the reading public would object to serial passions. The love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on Constants affair with Anna Lindsay who describes the affair in her correspondence . The book has been compared to Chateaubriands René or Mme de Staels Corinne.As a young man Constant became acquainted with a literary friend of his uncle David-Louis Constant de Rebecque. She was Isabelle de Charrière a Dutch woman of letters with whom he jointly wrote an epistolary novel under the title Les Lettres dArsillé fils Sophie Durfé et autres.

The importance of Constants writings on the liberty of the ancients and of that of his time has dominated understanding of his work as has his critique of the French Revolution. The British philosopher and historian of ideas Sir Isaiah Berlin has acknowledged his debt to Constant.

Constants wider literary and cultural writings emphasised the importance of self-sacrifice and effect of human emotions as a basis for social living. Thus while he pleaded for individual liberty as vital for individual and moral development and appropriate for modernity he felt that egoism and self-interest were not part of a true definition of individual liberty. Emotional authenticity and fellow-feeling were critical. In this his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and German thinkers such as Immanuel Kant whom he read in reference to his religious history.

Henry Corbin,"Henry Corbin was a French philosopher theologian Iranologist and professor of Islamic Studies at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris France.

Corbin was born in Paris in April 1903. Although he was Protestant by birth he was educated in the Catholic tradition and at the age of 19 received a certificate in Scholastic philosophy from the Catholic Institute of Paris. Three years later he took his licence de philosophie under the Thomist Étienne Gilson. In 1928 he encountered Louis Massignon director of Islamic studies at the Sorbonne and it was he who introduced Corbin to the writings of Suhrawardi the 12th century Persian mystic and philosopher whose work was to profoundly affect the course of Corbins life. Years later Corbin said through my meeting with Suhrawardi my spiritual destiny for the passage through this world was sealed. Platonism expressed in terms of the Zoroastrian angelology of ancient Persia illuminated the path that I was seeking.

Corbin is responsible for redirecting the study of Islamic philosophy as a whole. In his Histoire de la philosophie islamique he challenged the common view that philosophy among the Muslims came to an end after Ibn Rushd.

The philosophical life and career of Corbin can be divided into three phases. The first is the 1920s and 1930s when he was involved in learning and teaching western philosophy. The second is the years between 1939 and 1946 in which he studied Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and the School of Illumination in Istanbul. The last phase begins in 1946 and lasts until his death in which he studied and reintroduced eastern and Islamic philosophy.

In 1933 he married Stella Leenhardt. In 1938 he completed the first translation of one of Heideggers works into French . In 1939 they traveled to Istanbul and in 1945 to Tehran. They returned to Paris one year later in July 1946. In 1949 Corbin first attended the annual Eranos Conferences in Ascona Switzerland. In 1954 he succeeded Louis Massignon in the Chair of Islam and the Religions of Arabia. From the 1950s on he spent autumn in Tehran winter in Paris and spring in Ascona.

The three major works upon which his reputation largely rests in the English speaking world were first published in French in the 1950s Avicenna and the Visionary Recital Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn Arabi and Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth. His later major work on Central Asian and Iranian Sufism appears in English with an Introduction by Zia Inayat Khan as The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism. His magnum opus is the four volume En Islam Iranien Aspects spirituels et philosophiques. It has been translated into Persian twice by Dr Enshollah Rahmati and Reza Kuhkan from French . He died on 7 October 1978.

There are several main themes which together form the core of the spirituality that Corbin defends. The Imagination is the primary means to engage with Creation. Prayer is the supreme act of the creative imagination. He considered himself a Protestant Christian but he abandoned a Christocentric view of history. The grand sweep of his theology of the Holy Spirit embraces Judaism Christianity and Islam. He defended the central role assigned in theology for the individual as the finite image of the Unique Divine.

His mysticism is no world-denying asceticism but regards all of Creation as a theophany of the divine. This vision has much in common with what has become known as Creation Spirituality and the figure of the Angel Holy Spirit is similar to what is sometimes called the Cosmic Christ.

Corbins ideas continue to have an impact through the work of colleagues students and many others influenced by his work. Though this list is far from complete these include the following prolific Western scholars of Sufism and Islamic thought Seyyed Hossein Nasr William Chittick Christian Jambet Ali Amir-Moezzi Hermann Landolt Pierre Lory James Cowan James Morris and Todd Lawson. In England his influence has been felt in the work of Kathleen Raine Phillip Sherrard and other members of the Temenos Academy. Corbin was an important source for the archetypal psychology of James Hillman and others who have developed the psychology of Carl Jung. In addition Corbin was good friends with Jacques Lacan the French reinterpreter of Sigmund Freud which gave Lacan a familiarity with Islamic thought. The American literary critic Harold Bloom claims Corbin as a significant influence on his own conception of Gnosticism and the American poet Charles Olson was a student of Corbins Avicenna and the Visionary Recital. Corbins friends and colleagues in France have established LAssociation des Amis de Henry et Stella Corbin for the dissemination of his work through meetings and colloquia and the publication of his posthumous writings.

Corbins work has been criticized by a number of writers including Steven M. Wasserstrom. Corbins scholarly objectivity has been questioned on the basis of both a Shiite bias and his theological agenda; he has been accused of being both ahistorically naive and dangerously politically reactionary; and he has been charged with being both an Iranian nationalist and an elitist in both his politics and his spirituality. Forceful rejoinders to the more damning of these critiques by Lory and Subtelny have been particularly lucid."
Géraud de Cordemoy,"Géraud de Cordemoy was a French philosopher historian and lawyer. He is mainly known for his works in metaphysics and for his theory of language.

Géraud de Cordemoy was born in a family of ancient nobility coming from Auvergne . He was the third of four children. His father was a master in arts at the University of Paris named Géraud de Cordemoy who died when he was nine years old. His mother was named Nicole de Cordemoy. As for Géraud he was a private tutor and a linguist and practised as a lawyer.

Géraud de Cordemoy used to haunt the philosophical circles of the capital; he made acquaintance with Emmanuel Maignan and Jacques Rohault. A friend and a protégé of Bossuet who admired Descartes too Géraud de Cordemoy was appointed lecteur to the Dauphin at the same time as Fléchier. He was elected a member of Académie française in 1675.

Cordemoy is known primarily for having rethought the Cartesian theory of causality introducing the notion of occasional cause within a system of thought which remains essentially Cartesian. He was alongside Arnold Geulincx and Louis de La Forge the founder of what is called occasionalism. Body and soul are distinct by essence their combination is occasional and it is God who allows that the will to move my arm for example is translated into a movement. My will is an occasional cause of the movement of my arm God is the real cause of it. What is true for the body-an individual constituted by the distinct combination of body and soul- is true for every body in the universe. God is the real and universal cause of every movement.

By body Cordemoy means the ultimate components of matter. Using a judicial figure of speech he shows that the body in law a person in physics an ultimate component of matter is indivisible. Never mentioning atomism with that theory he comes close to the followers of Gassendi and to the free thinkers the so-called Libertines. In his work Le discernement du corps et de lâme he develops such thoughts which were criticized at that time by the followers of Descartes.

In his work Discours physique de la parole he asks himself the following question How can I as a thinking being be certain that the human beings who surround me are also thinking beings and not simple automatons The problem is considered at the end of the sixth speech on discrimination between body and soul. It is the word as a vehicle of the thought which will enable me to know the existence of other individuals who are endowed with a soul like me. In a more original way in his work Traité physique de la parole- a variation of the previous title - he develops the notion that no motivated relation between the material sign and the expressed idea exists as much as no real relation exists between body and soul. The word represents the opportunity for sign and meaning to meet so far as if the soul hadnt the use of the articulated body to produce sign it would communicate in a much more immediate way from soul to soul without having to go through the institution of the sign.

The language used by human beings is therefore too complex to be explained by purely mechanical causes; I can deduce from it that the bodies I can see are also endowed with a soul. Animals may utter sounds and parrots may reproduce words only human beings are able to communicate ideas and that shows the presence of a rational soul. This rational soul is able to communicate directly with angels without going through the physical articulation of the sign. Le Discours from which Molière drew the scene of the spelling lesson in Le Bourgeois gentilhomme remains the most successful work of Cordemoy. American linguists such as George Boas and Noam Chomsky rediscovered him during the sixties.

Cordemoy is also known for his Histoire de France on which he worked for 18 years without ever seeing the end so major were the contradictions he came up against while consulting the works of his predecessors. The work was finally finished by his elder son Louis-Géraud de Cordemoy and published after his death. Voltaire said of the work of Cordemoy as a historian He was the first to be able to disentangle the chaos of the two first races of the kings of France; thanks to the duke of Montausier who charged Cordemoy with the writing of the history of Charlemagne in view of the education of Monseigneur that useful work was achieved. He found in ancient authors nothing but absurdities and contradictions. That very difficulty encouraged him and enabled him to disentangle the two first races."
Paul-Louis Couchoud,"Paul-Louis Couchoud was a French philosopher a graduate from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris a physician a man of letters and a poet. He became well known as an adapter of Japanese haiku into French an editor of Reviews a translator and a writer promoting the German thesis of the non-historicity of Jesus Christ.

In 1898 Paul-Louis Couchoud entered the École Normale Supérieure a special college-level institute in Paris for French elite students in arts and sciences selected every year through a national competition. He graduated in 1901 as an agrégé in philosophy. The French degree is not directly comparable to an American one as it is granted to a few dozens of top-ranked students in a national competition held once a year.

Couchoud obtained a scholarship from the banker Albert Kahn. This grant allowed Couchoud to visit Japan a country which became a passion. During a trip on French canals by barge Couchoud and his two friends sculptor Albert Poncin and painter André Faure composed haiku in French. They published their work anonymously in a limited edition of Au fil de leau a collection of free-verse tercets which was well received. It still is considered one of the most successful adaptations of haiku in French. Couchoud also studied and translated Japanese Haijin in Les Épigrammes lyriques du Japon .

Couchoud made later two more trips to Japan and China from which resulted his collection Sages et poètes dAsie . In 1955 Marguerite Yourcenar wrote I have never met P. L. Couchoud but one of his books Sages et poètes dAsie which I still have in a hardback edition on my bookshelves in Northeast Harbor may have been the first work through which I encountered Asian poetry and thought. I was fifteen then and I still know by heart some haiku translated or adapted by him; this exquisite book was for me the equivalent of a half-open door. It has never closed. How much would I have loved to go and visit P. L. Couchoud with you and thank the sick poet for all what he made me feel or resonate.

In 1907 Couchoud became acquainted with the famous French writer Anatole France becoming his friend and confidante until A. Frances death in 1924. The French writer was famous as being the model of the ideal French man of letters. He was a passionate critic of the Catholic Church and an avowed opponent of the clerical political factions. He supported the Jew Alfred Dreyfus in the world-famous Dreyfus Affair. He received the Nobel Prize for literature in 1921 and in 1922 all his books were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum of the Vatican.

Couchoud took part in the sessions of the Salon organized by Leontine Lippmann Anatole Frances friend and muse known after her marriage as Madame Arman de Caillavet.

Couchoud became Anatole Frances doctor and upon the death of Leontine Lippmann he paid regular visits to A. France at the Villa Saïd in his quality of physician and also as a friend to bring him consolation during his mourning. He convinced A. France to go on another journey in Italy to overcome his grief. Couchoud acted as witness at the wedding of Anatole France and Emma Laprévotte . After Frances death Couchoud said of him For more than twenty years I have known him as if he were a gentle father always ready to listen and guide you.

In the mid 1900s Couchoud decided to study medicine. At the same time Albert Schweitzer was making the same choice in Germany after his studies in theology. After an internship at the Maison nationale of Charenton Couchoud became an intern in the asylum system of the Paris administration. He worked at the Maison Blanche Asylum as an assistant of Marc Trénel . Trenel entered a very complimentary appraisal of his assistant in his file High intelligence encyclopedic knowledge highly sophisticated mind. His future will be extraordinary . This assessment was confirmed by Albert Paraz who said of him ... a man of amazing culture reading all the ancient languages. He was so aggrieved when I confessed that I didnt understand them that in the end I made him believe that I could at least speak Latin and Greek ...

Couchoud presented in Paris his doctorate thesis on primitive asthenia . He became director of a health center in Saint-Cloud where he took care of Anatole France a center owned by Anthippe Sevastos the sculptor Antoine Bourdelles sister-in-law whom Couchoud ended up marrying .In 1922 Couchoud became a doctor at the leading Cochin hospital in Paris.

When the French writer Jules Romain started conducting experiments on extra-retinal vision criticisms of this pseudo-science obliged him to interrupt his research until 1922. One such session took place at Anatole Frances home which was witnessed by co-signing doctors including Couchoud who at the time offered his own home for another session .

Couchoud became intrigued by the German Christ Myth Theory after reading Orpheus a history of religions by Salomon Reinach another graduate of the ENS. Jacques Chevalier a close friend of Couchoud since their time at the ENS as students in philosophy was reported describing Couchouds decisive encounter with the new ideas fter attending Loisys lectures at the Collège de France Couchoud became convinced by a German thesis denying the historicity of Jesus. Which did not prevent him from using some poetic language when discussing Christianity for instance in The Enigma of Jesus and The God Jesus .

In the 1920s and 1930s Couchoud became an editor of major media projects on the history of religions. Archibald Robertson wrote that he works of Paul Louis Couchoud are such a joy to read that their style alone must have made many converts.

Couchoud presented his thesis in a first article published in the literary review Mercure de France The Enigma of Jesus and developed it in his first book The Enigma of Jesus which carried an introduction by the Scottish anthropologist James G. Frazer the famous author of The Golden Bough a pioneering study of primitive mythology and comparative religion. Frazer had initially strongly rejected the Jesus myth thesis but he modified his original dogmatic view while giving credit to Couchoud for his calm and reasoned analysis ...he appears to have laid his finger on a weak point in the chain of evidence on which hangs the religious faith of a great part of civilized mankind. Frazers contribution and more open stance gave a marked credibility to Couchoud.

Couchoud rejects Robertsons hypothesis of a pre-Christian cult of Joshua for which he finds no evidence. He presents his thesis in his article in the following terms

In the Creation of Christ they will be pushed to a later date around 135140. Couchoud was countered by articles written by the Jesuit Léonce de Grandmaison and the Protestant Maurice Goguel also in Le Mercure de France.

Couchoud continued exposing his thesis in a series of lectures to a cultural association the Union pour la Vérité in early 1924. He published a second article The Mystery of Jesus after having presented the proofs for inspection to A. France assuring him that You know that I have given you my heart. Couchoud produced a second book of the same title as the article to complete his exposé The Mystery of Jesus . In this second book Couchoud reproduced his two articles of the Mercure de France adding three more chapters. At the origin of Christianity there is if I am right not a personal biography but a collective mystical experience sustaining a divine history mystically revealed. He attempted to show that the study of the Apocalypse and of the non-Pauline epistles confirmed the conclusions drawn from the Pauline epistles. Only the testimony of Paul of Tarsus is valid. The docetic form of Christianity should be the orthodox one if Paul is defined as the true founder of Christianity.

As a first step Couchoud argued that it is impossible to assume that Jews would have deified a mere man. The methodology followed by contemporary historians from Ernest Renan to Alfred Loisy in trying to understand the figure of Jesus and the origins of Christianity faced two major obstacles One cannot accept that after one generation or even less an ordinary man could be deified and second that Jesuss life could have escaped the attention of historians there is no documentation of it. Couchoud believes that the entire Testimonium Flavianum is an interpolation. Everything in the Talmud concerning Jesus is derived from Christian sources . Of the three Roman witnesses Suetonius only mentions a Jewish agitator named Chrestos. Couchoud considers the Christ mention in the Tacitus passage genuine. But these Roman witnesses only testify to the existence of a Christian movement and concerning the origin of this movement they only repeated Christian beliefs.

Couchouds Mystery of Jesus was a slim volume not impressive by scholarly standards but in the France of 1924 it packed a lot of weight. Couchoud became de facto the leader of French rationalists on the subject of religion from 1924 to 1939. He was chief editor for a series of publications on religion and free thinking Christianity Judaism and Myths and Religions amounting to some 100 works.

Couchoud was made editor of a new section Chronicle of Ideas in the magazine Europe . The magazine published various articles popularizing Couchouds thesis that Jesus was not a historic figure to the objection of the French writer Romain Rolland. But after 1928 the Couchoud faction lost some of its influence with the publisher. Europe published Couchouds last article Le problème de Jésus in June 1934.

The original French title was Jésus Le Dieu fait homme .Challenged and criticized from all sides in France Couchoud published his book as a public answer. Couchoud had the advantage of the advanced research published by three elite scholars the independent historian Charles Guignebert the Protestant theologian Maurice Goguel and the excommunicated critic of the Catholic Church Alfred Loisy.

Couchoud displayed no acrimony against Christianity and always showed respect and appreciation for it occasionally using poetic language to describe Jesus and his influence. He dedicated the book to the memory of that most noble man John Mackinnon Robertson accepting his idea that a myth and a cult must have preceded the development of the figure of Christ and of the Christian religion.

Couchoud did not believe that a human Jesus had existed. Couchoud believed that the figure of Jesus Christ had been originally conceived by Jews as a purely heavenly Man who announced a cosmic transformation. This heavenly Jesus was amplified and diffused through the mystery books . It was only much later that he was made flesh and blood on paper. Thus Christ was created as a literary creation.

In The Creation of Christ Couchoud told a story in which Marcion wrote the first gospel followed by Basilides Mark Matthew John and Luke; Mark knew Pauls theology; the Acts of the Apostles is a thoroughly reliable historical source; and Clement of Rome is the likely author of the Gospel of Luke. 

The book of 459 pages was published in two slim volumes. It consists of three parts with 22 chapters and 2 Appendices

Couchouds thesis was received with passionate reactions in France a culture traditionally dominated by Catholicism and he became subjected to a wave of criticisms from various quarters.

Léonce de Grandmaison a priest of the Society of Jesus founder of the magazine Research in Religion science also answered Couchouds 1923 article in the Mercure de France with his own article Jesus in History which became the basis for his book Jesus in history and in mystery . He claimed that Couchouds work was the dream of a poet rather than the work of an historian. He followed with an article Recent French discussion of the Historical Existence of Jesus Christ. Couchouds policy was to make no formal response to criticisms.

The debate of the historicity of Jesus against the denial of historicity unfurled in Paris during 19231925. Maurice Goguel was a Professor at the Faculty of Protestant Theology and the Sorbonne University in Paris. Representing a group of liberal exegetes he responded to Couchouds first article with an article also published in the Mercure de France entitled About the Enigma of Jesus. To better criticize Couchouds ideas he also joined the discussions of The Union for Truth. Finally he tackled the whole issue of Couchouds non-historicity thesis in his Jesus of Nazareth Myth or History .

The liberal historian Charles Guignebert professor of History of ancient and medieval Christianity at the Sorbonne University had been raised without any religious education and studying Christianity as a professional historian free of religious bias and apologetics as shown in his The Jesus Problem . He defended the historicity of Jesus in an article in the Review of History of Religions then with his book Jesus criticizing the historicity denial of the major advocates of the time Paul-Louis Couchoud William Benjamin Smith John M. Robertson Peter Jensen Albert Kalthoff and Arthur Drews. On the other hand however he considered that research from Catholic circles was tainted with dogmatic bias. Like Alfred Loisy Guignebert objected to the apologetic use of historical criticism as it tends to confuse history with theology a literary genre characterizing the works of a whole group of French Catholic writers carefully identified in his book.

The Jesuit Joseph Huby published his book The Mythomaniacs of the Rationalist Union as a rebuttal to The Question of Jesus and the Origins of Christianity jointly published by P. L. Couchoud Prosper Alfaric and Alfred Loisy a book already condemned and placed on the Index by the Vatican .

Loisy had remained silent when Couchoud published The Mystery of Jesus refusing to make any public commentary. in a spirit of friendship Couchoud had organised Loisys jubilee celebration . Their relationship had created the public impression that Loisy was agreeing with Couchoud.

In his book La Naissance du Christianisme transl. The Birth of the Christian Religion Loisy had expressed doubts about the noisy conjectures... seem to me somewhat fragile. These conjectures arise generally from persons who have arrived late at the problem of Jesus and who have not previously made any profound study of the history of Israel and of Christianity...With us P.L Couchoud... postulating a pre-Christian myth of the Suffering Jahve which a vision of Simon Peter suddenly transformed into a living religion. . In his Memoirs Loisy later wrote that he had worried about giving Couchoud too much publicity. He had taken note that Couchoud was close to former radical priests who had also been excommunicated including Joseph Turmel sufficient grounds to arouse Loisys distrust. Loisy after a long silence felt the need to speak out publicly in an article in the Hibbert Journal Was Jesus a Historical Person then in his book History and Myth of Jesus attacking Couchouds non-historicity. He dismissed Couchouds central point being the metamorphosis into history through the initiative of Marcion of a myth that sprang from Jewish apocalyptic.

Couchoud was extremely hurt by Loisys publication whom he counted as a friend and ally. He wrote to Loisy

Couchoud responded to Loisy with an article in the same Hibbert Journal. He attached this response as appendix II to The Creation of Christ. He summarized the confrontation The historicity of Jesus is an article of faith. . However Couchoud reiterated his affirmation of the power of the spiritual figure of the Heavenly Christ. has no relation to the conception of a man elevated to divinity nor to that of the anthropomorphic God both of which were familiar to the religion of antiquity. It is an intimate and unique synthesis in which God retains his glory in its fullness and man his mortal destiny in its bitterness without change of God into man or of man into God. It was a new idea and it was by this new idea that the world was conquered.

Couchoud explained his own use of the word myth. A myth is a narrative aiming at shaping beliefs. A religious conception animates rites rituals and behaviors I am concerned the history of a religious conception. Myth is easily derogatory; it explains a natural fact a rite or an idea as a narrative to help the mind grasp and remember rules or beliefs. A religious conception is simpler and deeper far more unsophisticated and fertile. Its relation to rites and myths is primordial. Zeus is a religious conception. The punishment of the Danaids is a myth.

The Heavenly Christ is such a religious conception I regard it as philosophically impossible that the conception of the God-Man the Saviour of the world can have originated in any event of history...t is a great religious creation which arose in the context of the mystery cults and was founded on earlier conceptions and vitalized by mystic illuminations. Its consequences were developed slowly and in sequence.

George Santayana was an agnostic strongly influenced by Charles Darwins evolution who admired Lucretius and Spinoza. He had a soft attitude to religion calling it the Spiritual Life and as an aesthetic Catholic valuing the poetic and aesthetic benefits of belief to consciousness. He was sensitive to the major dilemma between accepting the skeptical findings of historical criticism and saving the spiritual value of the Idea of Christ. He thus shared some of Couchouds dual ideas towards Christianity and even some of Drews who had claimed that the ideal Christ was a better object of cult for Christianity than a historic Christ.

Couchoud as a psychiatrist accepted the idea that a religious movement could originate with psychological events such as visions interpreted by imagination very close to the symptoms of some psychiatric diseases. As a matter of psychiatric interest he wanted to visit a French female mystic Marthe Robin not far from Vienne where he had retired. She was a female peasant paralyzed since 1928 following undocumented mental traumas and spending her life in bed in a dark room reportedly without food. She had claimed visions of the Virgin Mary and having received the stigmata in 1930.

Jean Guitton was also a philosophy graduate of the ENS like Couchoud and a disciple of Henri Bergson . Guitton was a French Catholic philosopher interested in mysticism and a friend of Couchoud. Guitton interceded with the local archbishop to overcome the resistance of the mystics Catholic priest who was her spiritual director and allow visits by Couchoud. Guitton described his last conversation with Couchoud discussing the mystic on the quay of the Vienne train station when Couchoud recited a short poem about the mystic.

Guitton later reported in his book 26 years after Couchouds death that a quarter of an hour before his death Couchoud received by chance the visit of a priest. He died in the faith as I had the opportunity to say it at his funeral. This testimony by Jean Guitton became the source of a French legend that Couchoud would have converted on his deathbed spread in print by most French publications.

The reliability of this account has been disputed by those who doubt that the philosopherpsychiatrist who had been an admirer of Spinoza a skeptical rationalist all his life and a standard-bearer of the Christ Myth thesis would have reversed his lifetime convictions during a short unverified conversation on his deathbed.

The value of a deathbed conversion is that it saves a soul from hell in a Christian perspective. It also gives ammunition to believers for undermining the integrity of a Jesuss existence denier.

The thesis denying the historicity of Jesus has been abandoned by French academic studies since 1933 thanks to the critical work of the secular historian Charles Guignebert. Daniel Marguerat a Swiss Protestant former professor of NT at the University of Lausanne wrote that We are no longer in the age when Bruno Bauer or P. L. Couchoud went to great lengths to deny that Jesus had existed Nowadays the debate is about the meaning of his actions not his existence. Hermann Reimarus is the first source of doubts on the reliability of the Gospels information on Jesuss life.

A review of the French ideas about Jesus denial was presented by Charles Maignial Quick remarks on mythicism in the history of religions and of faith.

A reviewer of Stéphanes book asked Should we conclude that the question he question.. becomes placed in parenthesis which leads exegetes... to push the Jesus of history back into the shadows while vigorously spotlighting the Jesus of faith."
Antoine Augustin Cournot,"Antoine Augustin Cournot was a French philosopher and mathematician who also contributed to the development of economics.

Antoine Augustin Cournot was born at Gray Haute-Saône. In 1821 he entered one of the most prestigious Grandes Écoles the École Normale Supérieure and according to Sandmo

Subsequently Cournot held positions as professor of mathematics chief examiner for undergraduate students and rector of Dijon Academy.

By the time Cournot died in 1877 he was nearly blind.

Cournot was mainly a mathematician but had some influence in economics. His theories on monopolies and duopolies are still famous. In 1838 the book Researches on Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth was published in which he used the application of the formulas and symbols of mathematics in economic analysis. This book was strongly criticized and scarcely successful during Cournots lifetime. He attempted nonetheless to rewrite it twice. It is influential in economics today. Today many economists believe this book to be the point of departure for modern economic analysis. Cournot introduced the ideas of functions and probability into economic analysis. He derived the first formula for the rule of supply and demand as a function of price and in fact was the first to draw supply and demand curves on a graph anticipating the work of Alfred Marshall by roughly thirty years. The Cournot duopoly model developed in his book also introduced the concept of a Nash equilibrium the Reaction function and best-response dynamics.

Cournot believed that economists must utilize the tools of mathematics only to establish probable limits and to express less stable facts in more absolute terms. He further held that the practical uses of mathematics in economics do not necessarily involve strict numerical precision.

Today Cournots work is recognized in econometrics. He was also a teacher of political economy and mathematics to Auguste Walras who was the father of Léon Walras. Cournot and Auguste Walras persuaded Léon Walras to try political economics. Cournot is also credited to be one of the sources of inspiration for Léon Walras and his equilibrium theory.

In the field of economics he is best known for his work in the field of oligopoly theoryCournot competition which is named after him.

Cournot worked on determinism and chance.

Unlike Pierre-Simon de Laplace who thought that nothing happens by chance and Aristotle who thought that randomness and causality had nothing to do which each other Cournot united the concepts defining randomness as theencounter of two independent causal series.This definition allows randomness even in perfectly deterministic events and is used to generate random numbers by the combination of unrelated signals ."
Victor Cousin,"Victor Cousin was a French philosopher. He was the founder of eclecticism a briefly influential school of French philosophy that combined elements of German idealism and Scottish Common Sense Realism. As the administrator of public instruction for over a decade Cousin also had an important influence on French educational policy.

The son of a watchmaker he was born in Paris in the Quartier Saint-Antoine. At the age of ten he was sent to the local grammar school the Lycée Charlemagne where he studied until he was eighteen. Lycées being organically linked to the University of France and its Faculties since their Napoleonic institution Cousin was crowned in the ancient hall of the Sorbonne for a Latin oration he wrote which owned him a first prize at the concours général a competition between the best pupils at lycées . The classical training of the lycée strongly disposed him to literature or éloquence as it was then called. He was already known among his fellow students for his knowledge of Greek. From the lycée he graduated to the most prestigious of higher education schools École Normale Supérieure where Pierre Laromiguière was then lecturing on philosophy.

In the second preface to the Fragments philosophiques in which he candidly states the varied philosophical influences of his life Cousin speaks of the grateful emotion excited by the memory of the day when he heard Laromiguière for the first time. That day decided my whole life. Laromiguière taught the philosophy of John Locke and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac happily modified on some points with a clearness and grace which in appearance at least removed difficulties and with a charm of spiritual bonhomie which penetrated and subdued. That school has remained ever since the living heart of French philosophy; Henri Bergson Jean-Paul Sartre and Jacques Derrida are among its past students.

Cousin wanted to lecture on philosophy and quickly obtained the position of master of conferences in the school. The second great philosophical impulse of his life was the teaching of Pierre Paul Royer-Collard. This teacher he tells us by the severity of his logic the gravity and weight of his words turned me by degrees and not without resistance from the beaten path of Condillac into the way which has since become so easy but which was then painful and unfrequented that of the Scottish philosophy. The Scottish Philosophy being the Common Sense Philosophy of Thomas Reid and otherswhich taught that both the external world and the human mind had an objective existence. In 18151816 Cousin attained the position of suppliant to Royer-Collard in the history of modern philosophy chair of the faculty of letters. Another thinker who influenced him at this early period was Maine de Biran whom Cousin regarded as the unequalled psychological observer of his time in France.

These men strongly influenced Cousins philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes the lesson of decomposing thought even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions and especially in the simplest facts of consciousness the voluntary activity in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this triple discipline that Cousins philosophical thought was first developed and that in 1815 he began the public teaching of philosophy in the Normal School and in the faculty of letters.

He then took up the study of German worked at Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and sought to master the Philosophy of Nature of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling which at first greatly attracted him. The influence of Schelling may be observed very markedly in the earlier form of his philosophy. He sympathized with the principle of faith of Jacobi but regarded it as arbitrary so long as it was not recognized as grounded in reason. In 1817 he went to Germany and met Hegel at Heidelberg. Hegels Encyclopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften appeared the same year and Cousin had one of the earliest copies. He thought Hegel not particularly amiable but the two became friends. The following year Cousin went to Munich where he met Schelling for the first time and spent a month with him and Jacobi obtaining a deeper insight into the Philosophy of Nature.

Frances political troubles interfered for a time with his career. In the events of 18141815 he took the royalist side. He adopted the views of the party known as doctrinaire of which Royer-Collard was the philosophical leader. He seems to have gone further and to have approached the extreme Left. Then came a reaction against liberalism and in 18211822 Cousin was deprived of his offices in the faculty of letters and in the Normal School. The Normal School was swept away and Cousin shared the fate of Guizot who was ejected from the chair of history. This enforced abandonment of public teaching was a mixed blessing he set out for Germany with a view to further philosophical study. While at Berlin in 18241825 he was thrown into prison either on some ill-defined political charge at the instance of the French police or as a result of an indiscreet conversation. Freed after six months he remained under the suspicion of the French government for three years. It was during this period that he developed what is distinctive in his philosophical doctrine. His eclecticism his ontology and his philosophy of history were declared in principle and in most of their salient details in the Fragments philosophiques . The preface to the second edition and the third aimed at a vindication of his principles against contemporary criticism. Even the best of his later books the Philosophie écossaise the Du vrai du beau et du bien and the Philosophie de Locke were simply matured revisions of his lectures during the period from 1815 to 1820. The lectures on Locke were first sketched in 1819 and fully developed in the course of 1829.

During the seven years when he was prevented from teaching he produced besides the Fragments the edition of the works of Proclus and the works of René Descartes . He also commenced his Translation of Plato which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One sees in the Fragments very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the Fragments of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the Cours de lhistoire de la philosophie.

In 1828 de Vatimesnil minister of public instruction in Martignacs ministry recalled Cousin and Guizot to their professorial positions in the university. The three years which followed were the period of Cousins greatest triumph as a lecturer. His return to the chair was the symbol of the triumph of constitutional ideas and was greeted with enthusiasm. The hall of the Sorbonne was crowded as the hall of no philosophical teacher in Paris had been since the days of Pierre Abélard. The lecturers eloquence mingled with speculative exposition and he possessed a singular power of rhetorical climax. His philosophy showed strikingly the generalizing tendency of the French intellect and its logical need of grouping details round central principles.

There was a moral elevation in Cousins spiritual philosophy which touched the hearts of his listeners and seemed to be the basis for higher development in national literature and art and even in politics than the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy who like Jacobi Schelling and Dugald Stewart have united the gifts of speculative expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophyespecially its historywas revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.

Among those influenced by Cousin were Edgar Allan Poe Théodore Simon Jouffroy Jean Philibert Damiron Adolphe Garnier Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Jules Barthélemy Saint-Hilaire Felix Ravaisson-Mollien Charles de Rémusat Orestes Brownson Ralph Waldo Emerson Jules Simon Paul Janet Adolphe Franck and Patrick Edward Dove who dedicated his The Theory of Human Progression to himJouffroy and Damiron were first fellow-followers. students and then disciples. Jouffroy always kept firm to the earlythe French and Scottishimpulses of Cousins teaching. Cousin continued to lecture for two and a half years after his return to the chair. Sympathizing with the revolution of July he was at once recognized by the new government as a friend of national liberty. Writing in June 1833 he explains both his philosophical and his political positionI had the advantage of holding united against me for many years both the sensational and the theological school. In 1830 both schools descended into the arena of politics. The sensational school quite naturally produced the demagogic party and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism safe to borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach its ends as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore theocracy. On the other hand he who combated any exclusive principle in science was bound to reject also any exclusive principle in the state and to defend representative government.

The government was not slow to honour him. He was induced by the ministry of which his friend François Guizot was the head to become a member of the council of public instruction and counsellor of state and in 1832 he was made a Peer of France. He ceased to lecture but retained the title of professor of philosophy. Finally he accepted the position of minister of public instruction in 1840 under Adolphe Thiers. He was in addition director of the Normal School and virtual head of the university and from 1840 a member of the Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in the Institut de France. His character and his official position at this period gave him great power in the university and in the educational arrangements of the country.

The most important work he accomplished during this period was the organization of primary instruction. It was to the efforts of Cousin that France owed her advance in relation to primary education between 1830 and 1848. Prussia and Saxony had set the national example and France was guided into it by Cousin. Forgetful of national calamity and of personal wrong he looked to Prussia as affording the best example of an organized system of national education; and he was persuaded that to carry back the education of Prussia into France afforded a nobler triumph than the trophies of Austerlitz and Jena. In the summer of 1831 commissioned by the government he visited Frankfurt and Saxony and spent some time in Berlin. The result was a series of reports to the minister afterwards published as Rapport sur lEtat de linstruction publique dans quelques pays de lAllemagne et particulièrement en Prusse His views were readily accepted on his return to France and soon afterwards through his influence there was passed the law of primary instruction. 

In the words of the Edinburgh Review these documents mark an epoch in the progress of national education and are directly conducive to results important not only to France but to Europe. The Report was translated into English by Sarah Austin in 1834. The translation was frequently reprinted in the United States of America. The legislatures of New Jersey and Massachusetts distributed it in the schools at the expense of the states. Cousin remarks that among all the literary distinctions which he had received None has touched me more than the title of foreign member of the American Institute for Education. To the enlightened views of the ministries of Guizot and Thiers under the citizen-king and to the zeal and ability of Cousin in the work of organization France owes what is best in her system of primary educationa national interest which had been neglected under the French Revolution the Empire and the Restoration . In the first two years of the reign of Louis Philippe more was done for the education of the people than had been either sought or accomplished in all the history of France. In defence of university studies he stood manfully forth in the chamber of peers in 1844 against the clerical party on the one hand and the levelling or Philistine party on the other. His speeches on this occasion were published in a tractate Défense de luniversité et de la philosophie .

This period of official life from 1830 to 1848 was spent so far as philosophical study was concerned in revising his former lectures and writings in maturing them for publication or reissue and in research into certain periods of the sophical history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared De la Métaphysique dAristote suivi dun essai de traduction du premier et du douzième livres; in 1836 Cours de philosophie professé à la faculté des lettres pendant lannée 1818 and Œuvres inédites dAbélard. This Cours de philosophie appeared later in 1854 as Du vrai du beau et du bien. From 1825 to 1840 appeared Cours de lhistoire de la philosophie in 1829 Manuel de lhistoire de la philosophie de Tennemann translated from the German. In 18401841 we have Cours dhistoire de la philosophie morale au XVIIIe siècle . In 1841 appeared his edition of the Œuvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran; in 1842 Leçons de philosophie sur Kant and in the same year Des Pensées de Pascal. The Nouveaux fragments were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later in 1859 appeared Petri Abaelardi Opera.

Also during this period Cousin seems to have turned with fresh interest to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation under the influence of Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line we have besides the Des Pensées de Pascal 1842 Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal Madame de Longueville the marquise de Sable the duchesse de Chevreuse Madame de Hautefort . Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

When the reign of Louis Philippe came to a close through the opposition of his ministry with Guizot at its head to the demand for electoral reform and through the policy of the Spanish marriages Cousin who was opposed to the government on these points lent his sympathy to Cavaignac and the Provisional government. He published a pamphlet entitled Justice et charité the purport of which showed the moderation of his political views. It was markedly anti-socialistic. But from this period he passed almost entirely from public life and ceased to wield the personal influence which he had done during the preceding years. After the coup détat of 2 December he was deprived of his position as permanent member of the superior council of public instruction. From Napoleon and the Empire he stood aloof. A decree of 1852 placed him along with Guizot and Villemain in the rank of honorary professors. His sympathies were apparently with the monarchy under certain constitutional safeguards. Speaking in 1853 of the political issues of the spiritual philosophy which he had taught during his lifetime he says It conducts human societies to the true republic that dream of all generous souls which in our time can be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy.

During the last years of his life he occupied a suite of rooms in the Sorbonne where he lived simply and unostentatiously. The chief feature of the rooms was his noble library the cherished collection of a lifetime. He died in Cannes on 14 January 1867 in his seventy-fifth year. In the front of the Sorbonne below the lecture rooms of the faculty of letters a tablet records an extract from his will in which he bequeaths his noble and cherished library to the halls of his professorial work and triumphs.

There are three distinctive points in Cousins philosophy. These are his method the results of his method and the application of the method and its results to history especially to the history of philosophy. It is usual to speak of his philosophy as eclecticism. It is eclectic only in a secondary and subordinate sense. All eclecticism that is not self-condemned and inoperative implies a system of doctrine as its basis in fact a criterion of truth. Otherwise as Cousin himself remarks it is simply a blind and useless syncretism. And Cousin saw and proclaimed from an early period in his philosophical teaching the necessity of a system on which to base his eclecticism. This is indeed advanced as an illustration or confirmation of the truth of his system as a proof that the facts of history correspond to his analysis of consciousness. These three points the method the results and the philosophy of history are with him intimately connected. They are developments in a natural order of sequence. They become in practice Psychology Ontology and Eclecticism in history.

Cousin strongly insisted on the importance of method in philosophy. That which he adopts is the ordinary one of observation analysis and induction. This observational method Cousin regards as that of the 18th century the method which Descartes began and abandoned and which Locke and Condillac applied though imperfectly and which Thomas Reid and Kant used with more success. He insists that this is the true method of philosophy as applied to consciousness in which alone the facts of experience appear. But the proper condition of the application of the method is that it shall not through prejudice of system omit a single fact of consciousness. If the authority of consciousness is good in one instance it is good in all. If not to be trusted in one it is not to be trusted in any. Previous systems have erred in not presenting the facts of consciousness.

The observational method applied to consciousness gives us the science of psychology. This is the basis and the only proper basis of ontology or metaphysics the science of being and of the philosophy of history. To the observation of consciousness Cousin adds induction as the complement of his method by which he means inference as to reality necessitated by the data of consciousness and regulated by certain laws found in consciousness those of reason. By his method of observation and induction as thus explained his philosophy will be found to be marked off very clearly on the one hand from the deductive construction of notions of an absolute system as represented either by Schelling or Hegel which Cousin regards as based simply on hypothesis and abstraction illegitimately obtained; and on the other from that of Kant and in a sense of Sir W. Hamilton both of which in the view of Cousin are limited to psychology and merely relative or phenomenal knowledge and issue in scepticism so far as the great realities of ontology are concerned. What Cousin finds psychologically in the individual consciousness he finds also spontaneously expressed in the common sense or universal experience of humanity. In fact it is with him the function of philosophy to classify and explain universal convictions and beliefs; but common-sense is not with him philosophy nor is it the instrument of philosophy; it is simply the material on which the philosophical method works and in harmony with which its results must ultimately be found.

The three great results of psychological observation are Sensibility Activity or Liberty and Reason. These three facts are different in character but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations or the facts of the sensibility are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We find ourselves in a strange world between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness then is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.

But there is a peculiarity in Cousins doctrine of activity or freedom and in his doctrine of reason which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This is the heart of what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so although it is preceded by deliberation and determination i.e. reflection for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But there is a primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first otherwise we could not know before our reflective volition that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.

But it is in his doctrine of the Reason that the distinctive principle of the philosophy of Cousin lies. The reason given to us by psychological observation the reason of our consciousness is impersonal in its nature. We do not make it; its character is precisely the opposite of individuality; it is universal and necessary. The recognition of universal and necessary principles in knowledge is the essential point in psychology; it ought to be put first and emphasized to the last that these exist and that they are wholly impersonal or absolute. The number of these principles their enumeration and classification is an important point but it is secondary to that of the recognition of their true nature. This was the point which Kant missed in his analysis and this is the fundamental truth which Cousin thinks he has restored to the integrity of philosophy by the method of the observation of consciousness. And how is this impersonality or absoluteness of the conditions of knowledge to be established The answer is in substance that Kant went wrong in putting necessity first as the criterion of those laws. This brought them within the sphere of reflection and gave as their guarantee the impossibility of thinking them reversed; and led to their being regarded as wholly relative to human intelligence restricted to the sphere of the phenomenal incapable of revealing to us substantial realitynecessary yet subjective. But this test of necessity is a wholly secondary one; these laws are not thus guaranteed to us; they are each and all given to us given to our consciousness in an act of spontaneous apperception or apprehension immediately instantaneously in a sphere above the reflective consciousness yet within the reach of knowledge. And all subjectivity with all reflection expires in the spontaneity of apperception. The reason becomes subjective by relation to the voluntary and free self; but in itself it is impersonal; it belongs not to this or to that self inhumanity; it belongs not even to humanity. We may say with truth that nature and humanity belong to it for without its laws both would perish.

But what is the number of those laws Kant reviewing the enterprise of Aristotle in modern times has given a complete list of the laws of thought but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced. According to Cousin there are but two primary laws of thought that of causality and that of substance. From these flow naturally all the others. In the order of nature that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our knowledge causality precedes substance or rather both are given us in each other and are contemporaneous in consciousness.

These principles of reason cause and substance given thus psychologically enable us to pass beyond the limits of the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality they enable us in a word to pass from psychology or the science of knowledge to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation with free activity and fatal action or impression and they guide us in rising to a personal being a self or free cause and to an impersonal reality a not-menature the world of forcelying out of us and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause necessarily other than myself that is to an external cause whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.

But these two forces the me and the not-me are reciprocally limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena attention and sensation and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute causes correlative and reciprocally finite to which they are related so from the notion of this limitation we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause absolute and infinite itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates and he creates necessarily.

This theodicy of Cousin laid him open obviously enough to the charge of pantheism. This he repels and his answer may be summed up as follows. Pantheism is properly the deification of the law of phenomena the universe God. But I distinguish the two finite causes self and not-self from each other and from the infinite cause. They are not mere modifications of this cause or properties as with Spinozathey are free forces having their power or spring of action in themselves and this is sufficient for our idea of independent finite reality. I hold this and I hold the relation of these as effects to the one supreme cause. The God I plead for is neither the deity of Pantheism nor the absolute unity of the Eleatics a being divorced from all possibility of creation or plurality a mere metaphysical abstraction. The deity I maintain is creative and necessarily creative. The deity of Spinoza and the Eleatics is a mere substance not a cause in any sense. As to the necessity under which Deity exists of acting or creating this is the highest form of liberty it is the freedom of spontaneity activity without deliberation. His action is not the result of a struggle between passion and virtue. He is free in an unlimited manner the purest spontaneity in man is but the shadow of the freedom of God. He acts freely but not arbitrarily and with the consciousness of being able to choose the opposite part. He cannot deliberate or will as we do. His spontaneous action excludes at once the efforts and the miseries of will and the mechanical operation of necessity.

The elements found in consciousness are also to be found in the history of humanity and in the history of philosophy. In external nature there are expansion and contraction which correspond to spontaneity and reflection. External nature again in contrast with humanity expresses spontaneity; humanity expresses reflection. In human history the East represents the spontaneous stage; the Pagan and Christian world represent stages of reflection. This was afterwards modified expanded and more fully expressed by saying that humanity in its universal development has three principal moments. First in the spontaneous stage where reflection is not yet developed and art is imperfect humanity has thought only of the immensity around it. It is preoccupied by the infinite. Secondly in the reflective stage mind has become an object to itself. It thus knows itself explicitly or reflectively. Its own individuality is now the only or at least the supreme thing. This is the moment of the finite. Thirdly there comes an epoch in which the self or me is subordinated. Mind realizes another power in the universe. The finite and the infinite become two real correlatives in the relation of cause and product. This is the third and highest stage of development the relation of the finite and the infinite. As philosophy is but the highest expression of humanity these three moments will be represented in its history. The East typifies the infinite Greece the finite or reflective epoch the modern era the stage of relation or correlation of infinite and finite. In theology the dominant philosophical idea of each of these epochs results in pantheism polytheism theism. In politics we have a correspondence also with the ideas of monarchy democracy and constitutional polity.

Eclecticism thus means the application of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism idealism skepticism mysticism with the facts of consciousness the chasm result was reached that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas which is in truth very real but which is not alone in consciousness and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems we should have a complete philosophy adequate to the totality of consciousness. Philosophy as thus perfected would not be a mere aggregation of systems as is ignorantly supposed but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.

Such is the system in outline. The historical position of the system lies in its relations to Kant Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned in the form of infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or effort on the part of and something different from a mere negation yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.

With Schelling again Cousin agrees in regarding this supreme ground of all as positively apprehended and as a source of development but he utterly repudiates Schellings method. The intellectual intuition either falls under the eye of consciousness or it does not. If not how do you know it and its object which are identical If it does it comes within the sphere of psychology; and the objections to it as thus a relative made by Schelling himself are to be dealt with. Schellings intellectual intuition is the mere negation of knowledge.

Again the pure being of Hegel is a mere abstraction a hypothesis illegitimately assumed which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established is the possibility of reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the very thing assumed as a starting-point. Besides this of course objections might be made to the method of development as not only subverting the principle of contradiction but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling as above consciousness the pure being of Hegel as an empty abstraction unvindicated illegitimately assumed and arbitrarilydeveloped are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin still holding by essential knowledge of being to ground it in an analysis of consciousness in psychology.

The absolute or infinitethe unconditioned ground and source of all realityis yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousnessunder its condition that to wit of distinguishing subject and object knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by Sir W Hamilton in the Edinburgh Review of 1829 and it was animadverted upon about the same time by Schelling. Hamiltons objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality as Cousin supposes; on the contrary it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the samethat the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these the positive alone is real the negative is only an abstraction of the other and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself. A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamiltons objection which has been set afloat recently that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that which you do not know The answer to this is that in the case of contradictory statementsA and not Athe latter is a mere negation of the former and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes as the finite does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known ere the finite is negated or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positivei.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it or suppose that it is known beforehand or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic and it paralyzes the whole of the Logic. Secondly the conditions of intelligence which Cousin allows necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolutethey are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousins absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects and dependent for reality on thesein a word a mere potence or becoming. Further as a theory of creation it makes creation a necessity and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamiltons criticism beyond alleging that Hamiltons doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere theodicy.

The attempt to render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them in the sphere of spontaneous apperception and above reflective necessity is unsuccessful. Cause substance time space are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance much less in such a primitive act do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.

But if these three correlative facts are immediately given it seems to be thought possible by Cousin to vindicate them in reflective consciousness. He seeks to trace the steps which the reason has spontaneously and consciously but irreflectively followed. And here the question arisesCan we vindicate in a reflective or mediate process this spontaneous apprehension of reality

The self is found to be a cause of force free in its action on the ground that we are obliged to relate the volition of consciousness to the self as its cause and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort but not this or that reality as the cause. And further the principle of causality if fairly carried out as universal and necessary would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effectvolition. Once applied to the facts at all it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or groundin fact land us in an infinite regress of causes.

The same criticism is even more emphatically applicable to the influence of a not-self or world of forces corresponding to our sensations and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis causality could never give us this even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces existing in space independently of us and corresponding to our sensations it could never tell us for the simple reason that such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions and cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us or even suggest to us beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise for aught we know so far as causality leads us not from a world of forces at all but from a will like our own though infinitely more powerful acting upon us partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is with the principle of causality at work within the limits of probability as we are already supposed to know such a realitya willin our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.

The truth is that Cousins doctrine of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts to little more than a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude self and not-self; in a word to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and beingwhether and how we are to relate our fundamental intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience or to an infinite beingare problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.

Cousins doctrine of spontaneity in volition can hardly be said to be more successful than his impersonality of the reason through Volition spontaneous apperception. Sudden unpremeditated volition may be the earliest and the most artistic but it is not the best. Volition is essentially a free choice between alternatives and that is best which is most deliberate because it is most rational. Aristotle touched this point in his distinction between oiX-ns and srpoatpecric. The sudden and unpremeditated wish represented by the former is wholly inferior in character to the free choice of the latter guided and illumined by intelligence. In this we can deliberately resolve upon what is in our power; in that we are subject to the vain impulse of wishing the impossible. Spontaneity is pleasing sometimes beautiful but it is not in this instance the highest quality of the thing to be obtained. That is to be found in a guiding and illumining reflective activity.

Eclecticism is not open to the superficial objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history and all their combinations. It may be asked Can history have that which is not in the individual consciousness In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements and combinations of elements in man as a study of consciousness. Besides the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order whereas this may not at all be the case; but we may find at any epoch the whole mixed either crossing or co-operative as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.

It was the tendency of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy but he left very interesting psychological analyses and several new just and true expositions of philosophical systems especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was at the same time a man of impressive power of rare and wide culture and of lofty aim far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism to the dogmatism of sensationalism and to the doctrine of church authority preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning who greatly influenced others Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.

Sir W. Hamilton one of his most resolute opponents described Cousin as A profound and original thinker a lucid and eloquent writer a scholar equally at home in ancient and in modern learning a philosopher superior to all prejudices of age or country party or profession and whose lofty eclecticism seeking truth under every form of opinion traces its unity even through the most hostile systems."
Louis Couturat,"Louis Couturat was a French logician mathematician philosopher and linguist. Couturat was a pioneer of the constructed language Ido.

Born in Ris-Orangis Essonne France. In 1887 he entered École Normale Supérieure to study philosophy and mathematics. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the University of Toulouse and 1897 lectured in philosophy of mathematics at the University of Caen Normandy taking a stand in favor of transfinite numbers. After a time in Hanover studying the writings of Leibniz he became an assistant to Henri-Louis Bergson at the Collège de France in 1905.

He was the French advocate of the symbolic logic that emerged in the years before World War I thanks to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce Giuseppe Peano and his school and especially to The Principles of Mathematics by Couturats friend and correspondent Bertrand Russell. Like Russell Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics. In this he was opposed by Henri Poincaré who took considerable exception to Couturats efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the logicism of Russell while Poincaré anticipated Brouwers intuitionism.

His first major publication was Couturat . In 1901 he published La Logique de Leibniz a detailed study of Leibniz the logician based on his examination of the huge Leibniz Nachlass in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716 his Nachlass was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibnizs unpublished work on logic. In 1903 Couturat published much of that work in another large volume his Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz containing many of the documents he had examined while writing La Logique. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate Aristotle from George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturats editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship.

In 1905 Couturat published a work on logic and the foundations of mathematics that was originally conceived as a translation of Russells Principles of Mathematics. In the same year he published LAlgèbre de la logique a classic introduction to Boolean algebra and the works of C.S. Peirce and Ernst Schröder.

In 1907 Couturat helped found the constructed language Ido an offshoot of Esperanto and was Idos principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages Couturat was paralleling Peanos advocacy of Interlingua. By pushing Ido Couturat walked in Leibnizs footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the characteristica universalis.

Couturat a confirmed pacifist was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the French Army in the first stage of World War I.

He appears as a character in Joseph Skibells 2010 novel A Curable Romantic."
Marc Crépon,"Marc Crépon is a French philosopher and academic who writes on the subject of languages and communities in the French and German philosophies and contemporary political and moral philosophy. He has also translated works by philosophers such as Nietzsche Franz Rosenzweig and Leibniz.

He is Professor of Philosophy at the Ecole Normale Superieure and director of research at the Archives Husserl National Center for Scientific Research.

He was born in Decize Nievre in 1962. After high school Crépon completed a preparatory course at Lycee Condorcet in Paris. He then attended the Ecole Normale Superieure and passed the agrégation in 1986 a French civil service exam for positions in public education.

The topic of his dissertation was The problem of human diversity survey on the characterization of the people and the constitution of geographies of spirit from Leibniz to Hegel .

Crépons first academic position was teaching philosophy at Nanterre University. Shortly after this he moved to Moldova for a period and credits living and working in the USSR with developing many of his attitudes and pedagogical methods. At this time he also developed an interest in the relationship between political and linguistic communities which he would go on to research in greater detail.

He has traveled and lectured at American universities including University of California Irvine and Rice University. Crépon also taught classes while in residence at Northwestern University in Chicago in 2006 and in 2008.

Marc Crépon was the co-founder of the association Ars Industrialis.

Marc Crépon has written 16 books in French the most notable of which are listed below."
Marin Cureau de la Chambre,"Marin Cureau de la Chambre was a French physician and philosopher born in Saint-Jean-dAssé a village near Le Mans.

Details of his youth and where he attended school are unknown. He was initially a physician in Le Mans and around 1630 moved to Paris where he became a friend and physician to Pierre Séguier . Afterwards he was a médecin ordinaire to Louis XIV. Reportedly the monarch was impressed by Cureau de la Chambres ability to judge human character based on physical appearance.

Marin Cureau de la Chambre is largely known for his work in physiognomy. Between 1640 and 1662 he published a five-volume study on mans character and passions called Caractères des passions. He wrote articles on many other topics including palmistry digestion reasoning in animals occult practices and optics. On the latter subject he investigated the nature of light and color refractions and the possibility of primary and secondary colors. He was the author of books on philosophy and published a translation of Aristotles Physica.

In 1634 he became an early member of the Académie française and in 1666 was an original member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was the father of clergyman Pierre Cureau de La Chambre and of François Cureau de La Chambre who succeeded him at the Botanical Garden .. He died in Paris on December 29 1669.

In 1991 astronomer Eric Walter Elst named the asteroid 7126 Cureau after Marin Cureau de la Chambre."
Jean le Rond d'Alembert,"Jean-Baptiste le Rond dAlembert was a French mathematician mechanician physicist philosopher and music theorist. Until 1759 he was together with Denis Diderot a co-editor of the Encyclopédie.DAlemberts formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as dAlemberts equation and the fundamental theorem of algebra is named after dAlembert in French.

Born in Paris dAlembert was the natural son of the writer Claudine Guérin de Tencin and the chevalier Louis-Camus Destouches an artillery officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of dAlemberts birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris church. According to custom he was named after the patron saint of the church. DAlembert was placed in an orphanage for foundling children but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a glazier Madame Rousseau with whom he lived for nearly 50 years. She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied

You will never be anything but a philosopherand what is that but an ass who plagues himself all his life that he may be talked about after he is dead.

Destouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond but did not want his paternity officially recognised.

DAlembert first attended a private school. The chevalier Destouches left dAlembert an annuity of 1200 livres on his death in 1726. Under the influence of the Destouches family at the age of 12 dAlembert entered the Jansenist Collège des Quatre-Nations . Here he studied philosophy law and the arts graduating as baccalauréat en arts in 1735.

In his later life dAlembert scorned the Cartesian principles he had been taught by the Jansenists physical promotion innate ideas and the vortices. The Jansenists steered dAlembert toward an ecclesiastical career attempting to deter him from pursuits such as poetry and mathematics. Theology was however rather unsubstantial fodder for dAlembert. He entered law school for two years and was nominated avocat in 1738.

He was also interested in medicine and mathematics. Jean was first registered under the name Daremberg but later changed it to dAlembert. The name dAlembert was proposed by Frederick the Great of Prussia for a suspected moon of Venus.

In July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics pointing out the errors he had detected in Analyse démontrée in a communication addressed to the Académie des Sciences. At the time Lanalyse démontrée was a standard work which dAlembert himself had used to study the foundations of mathematics. DAlembert was also a Latin scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a superb translation of Tacitus for which he received wide praise including that of Denis Diderot.

In 1740 he submitted his second scientific work from the field of fluid mechanics Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides which was recognised by Clairaut. In this work dAlembert theoretically explained refraction.

In 1741 after several failed attempts dAlembert was elected into the Académie des Sciences. He was later elected to the Berlin Academy in 1746 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1748.

In 1743 he published his most famous work Traité de dynamique in which he developed his own laws of motion.

When the Encyclopédie was organised in the late 1740s dAlembert was engaged as co-editor with Diderot and served until a series of crises temporarily interrupted the publication in 1757. He authored over a thousand articles for it including the famous Preliminary Discourse. DAlembert abandoned the foundation of Materialism when he doubted whether there exists outside us anything corresponding to what we suppose we see. In this way dAlembert agreed with the Idealist Berkeley and anticipated the transcendental idealism of Kant.

In 1752 he wrote about what is now called DAlemberts paradox that the drag on a body immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid is zero.

In 1754 dAlembert was elected a member of the Académie des sciences of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772.

In 1757 an article by dAlembert in the seventh volume of the Encyclopedia suggested that the Geneva clergymen had moved from Calvinism to pure Socinianism basing this on information provided by Voltaire. The Pastors of Geneva were indignant and appointed a committee to answer these charges. Under pressure from Jacob Vernes Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others dAlembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist and that was all he meant and he abstained from further work on the encyclopaedia following his response to the critique.

He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.

DAlemberts first exposure to music theory was in 1749 when he was called upon to review a Mémoire submitted to the Académie by Jean-Philippe Rameau. This article written in conjunction with Diderot would later form the basis of Rameaus 1750 treatise Démonstration du principe de lharmonie. DAlembert wrote a glowing review praising the authors deductive character as an ideal scientific model. He saw in Rameaus music theories support for his own scientific ideas a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure.

Two years later in 1752 dAlembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameaus works in his Eléments de musique théorique et pratique suivant les principes de M. Rameau. Emphasizing Rameaus main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed dAlembert helped to popularise the work of the composer and advertise his own theories. He claims to have clarified developed and simplified the principles of Rameau arguing that the single idea of the corps sonore was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music. DAlembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major musical mode the minor mode and the identity of octaves. Because he was not a musician however dAlembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameaus thinking changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music.

Although initially grateful Rameau eventually turned on dAlembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with J. J. Rousseaus Encyclopédie articles on music. This led to a series of bitter exchanges between the men and contributed to the end of dAlembert and Rameaus friendship. A long preliminary discourse dAlembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his Elémens attempted to summarise the dispute and act as a final rebuttal.

DAlembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated Discours préliminaire of Diderots Encyclopédie. DAlembert claims that compared to the other arts music which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it. He wanted musical expression to deal with all physical sensations rather than merely the passions alone. DAlembert believed that modern music had only achieved perfection in his age as there existed no classical Greek models to study and imitate. He claimed that time destroyed all models which the ancients may have left us in this genre. He praises Rameau as that manly courageous and fruitful genius who picked up the slack left by Jean-Baptiste Lully in the French musical arts.

DAlembert was a participant in several Parisian salons particularly those of Marie Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin of the marquise du Deffand and of Julie de Lespinasse. DAlembert became infatuated with Mlle de Lespinasse and eventually took up residence with her.

He suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a urinary bladder illness. As a known unbeliever DAlembert was buried in a common unmarked grave.

In France the fundamental theorem of algebra is known as the dAlembertGauss theorem as an error in dAlemberts proof was caught by Gauss.

He also created his ratio test a test to see if a series converges.

The DAlembert operator which first arose in DAlemberts analysis of vibrating strings plays an important role in modern theoretical physics.

While he made great strides in mathematics and physics dAlembert is also famously known for incorrectly arguing in Croix ou Pile that the probability of a coin landing heads increased for every time that it came up tails. In gambling the strategy of decreasing ones bet the more one wins and increasing ones bet the more one loses is therefore called the DAlembert system a type of martingale.

In South Australia a small inshore island in south-western Spencer Gulf was named Ile dAlembert by the French explorer Nicolas Baudin during his expedition to New Holland. The island is better known by the alternative English name of Lipson Island. The island is a conservation park and seabird rookery.

Diderot portrayed dAlembert in Le rêve de DAlembert written after the two men had become estranged. It depicts dAlembert ill in bed conducting a debate on materialist philosophy in his sleep.

DAlemberts Principle a 1996 novel by Andrew Crumey takes its title from DAlemberts principle in physics. Its first part describes dAlemberts life and his infatuation with Julie de Lespinasse."
François Dagognet,"François Dagognet was a 20th-century French philosopher.

François Dagognet was born in Langres. He studied both science and philosophy and was a student of Georges Canguilhem. He was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Lyon before becoming Professor of Philosophy at Pantheon-Sorbonne University.

Dagognet wrote extensively on the philosophy of the body."
Étienne Noël Damilaville,"Damilaville authored three articles in the Encyclopédie - Population Peace and The Vingtième.

Damilaville is believed to have coauthored an article in the Encyclopédie on the Vingtieme tax regime with Diderot his trusted associate. His treatise is largely a discussion on the nature of government of civil society and of the economy. Like Montesquie Damilaville makes a clear distinction between the state as an aggregate of people in society and government. The treatise uses this dichotomy between the state and government to rationalize the necessity of taxes; however Damilaville also argues tax simplification or reform. What is important

Voltaire regarded him as a very close friend and wrote him at least 539 letters over eight years. They only actually met for the first time after they had been corresponding for five years on 20 August 1765 when Damilaville visited Ferney.

Opinion of Damilaville was not universally positive Melchior Grimm said of him

He had neither grace nor mental wit and he lacked the worldly savoir-faire which makes up for it. He was sad and heavy and his lack of basic education always showed through."
Jean Philibert Damiron,"Jean-Philibert Damiron was a French philosopher.

Damiron was born at Belleville. At nineteen he entered the École Normale where he studied under Eugène Burnouf Abel-Francois Villemain and Victor Cousin. After teaching for several years in provincial towns he came to Paris where he lectured on philosophy in various institutions and finally became professor in the normal school and titular professor at the Sorbonne. In 1824 he joined Paul-François Dubois and Théodore Simon Jouffroy in establishing Le Globe; and he was also a member of the committee of the society which took for its motto Aide-toi le ciel taidera. In 1833 he was appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour and in 1836 member of the Academy of Moral Sciences. Damiron died in Paris.

Damiron works are known for his accounts of French philosophers"
Hubert Damisch,"Hubert Damisch was a French philosopher specialised in aesthetics and art history and professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1975 until 1996.

Damisch studied at the Sorbonne with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and later with Pierre Francastel. In 1967 he founded the Cercle dhistoirethéorie de lart that would later become the CEHTA at the EHESS.

Françoise Dastur,Françoise Dastur is a French philosopher. She is Professor Emeritus at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis. She is a specialist of the works of Martin Heidegger.
Jean Daujat,"Jean Daujat was a French philosopher of neo-Thomism a disciple of Jacques Maritain and the founder of the Centre détudes religieuses the Center for Religious Studies specializing in teaching Christian doctrine.

Jean Daujat was born on 27 October 1906 in Paris to parents who were non-practicing believers. Daujat was home schooled by his mother until he entered the Lycee Pasteur in 1918. He obtained a BA in philosophy with honors in mathematics.

In September 1923 Daujat entered Lycée Janson-de-Sailly where he studied mathematics. Meanwhile his former high school biology teacher Pastor Jules Lefevre directed him toward the philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Daujat also discovered the philosophy of Jacques Maritain who greatly influenced his own work. Jules Lefevre then introduced him to Amédée dYvignac who had founded the French Gazette which was subtitled organ of Christian politics. Jean Daujat collaborated in this review along with Maritain Henri Massis and Henri Gheon.

In the fall of 1925 Jean Daujat and a group of seven men began the Centre détudes religieuses. The creation of the Centre détudes religieuses would be the focus his work for the rest of his life.

In 1926 Jean Daujat entered the Ecole Normale Superieure to study science. Classmates included Étienne Borne and Merleau-Ponty in the literature department the mathematician Chevalley and the physicist and geneticist Rosenfeld Heir. Other influential men who attended alongside Daujat were Raymond Aron Paul Nizan Jean-Paul Sartre Henri Cartan and Jean Dieudonné two of the founders of the Bourbaki group Louis Neel Nobel Prize laureate in physics Olivier Lacombe also a disciple of Jacques Maritain and specialist in Oriental languages Henri-Irénée Marrou Maurice Bardeche Robert Brasillach Thierry Maulnier and Simone Weil.

During this period Daujat continued his philosophical and spiritual training. With Maritain he became acquainted with Vladimir Ghika a Romanian prince who became a Catholic priest. Daujat dedicated a book to Ghika some fifty years later as well as Father Garrigou-Lagrange. For several years he has collaborated with writer Yvonne ERC Estienne.

In 1930 Daujat married Danish painter Sonia Hansen a talented portraitist and landscape painter.

In 1931 Daujat began teaching himself at the Centre détudes religieuses supported by Cardinal Verdier. He begins to write a treatise on theology and spirituality The Supernatural Life which appeared in 1938 with a preface by Archbishop Beaussart and Father Garrigou-Lagrange. In 1933 he founded the Monthly Magazine which was published until 1939. In addition to its own articles and those of Yvonne Estienne there were many prestigious authors who wrote for the magazine such as Father Garrigou-Lagrange Mgt Ghika Father Lallement Jacques Maritain Henri Gheon Charles Du Bos Stanislas Broth Robert of Harcourt Gustave Thibon Henriette Charasson Olivier Lacombe Merleau-Ponty and Jacques Madaule. Daujat published several books on philosophy and theology. In 1970 The Christian Social Order. And In 1974 Y a-t-il une Verite was published.

After the war his teaching affected thousands of students. He wrote for several magazines like The New Man or The Catholic France. He published over thirty books some of which were translated into several languages.In December 1946 he defended a thesis on the history of science on the theory of electric and magnetic phenomena before a jury that included Gaston Bachelard and Louis de Broglie. He published two books on the philosophy of science Modern Physics and Traditional Philosophy.

Because of a Communist threat he received after publishing a booklet showing the perversion of communism which sold hundreds of thousands of copies Daujat was asked to speak at numerous conferences on this subject. He published his last book in 1996."
Lionel Dauriac,"Lionel Dauriac was a French philosopher and musicologist.

Dauriac was born in Brest the son of an admiral. He was professor of musical aesthetics at the Sorbonne between 1896 and 1903. He died 26 May 1923 in Paris. An internationally minded music critic he wrote biographies of Gioachino Rossini Richard Wagner and Giacomo Meyerbeer."
David of Dinant,"David of Dinant was a pantheistic philosopher. He may have been a member of or at least been influenced by a pantheistic sect known as the Amalricians. David was condemned by the Church in 1210 for his writing of the Quaternuli which forced him to flee Paris. When and where he died is unknown; all that can be ascertained is that he died after the year 1215 as he was condemned again in the council of 1215.

Since Davids works were banned most of what is known of him is from the writings of his contemporaries and opponents chiefly Albert the Great and St. Thomas Aquinas. Davids philosophy was that everything could be divided among bodies minds and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter ; of minds or souls intellect ; and of eternal substances God . These three matter intellect and God are actually one and the same. Consequently all things material intellectual and spiritual have one and the same essence God.

Little is known about the details of his life. It is not certain whether he was born at Dinant in Flanders or at Dinan in Brittany. He is believed to have lived for some time at the Roman Court under Pope Innocent III. He was a magister or teacher most likely at the University of Paris and he studied the classical works of Aristotle which had been reintroduced to Europe after the Crusades. It seems likely he was especially influenced by Aristotles Physics and Metaphysics. It was in Paris that his work entitled Quaternuli was condemned by a provincial council in 1210. The Council was headed by Peter of Corbeil the Bishop of Sens and ordered the body of Amalric of Chartres to be disinterred and burned Davids writings to be burned and forbade reading Aristotles works on natural philosophy. Anyone in the possession of Davids writings after Christmas was declared a heretic. This condemnation of both David and Aristotle was repeated in 1215 by a letter of Cardinal Robert Courçon papal legate. From a work ascribed to Albert the Great Compilatio de Novo Spiritu in the Munich Library we learn further that in consequence of the condemnation David fled from France and so escaped punishment. Besides the Quaternuli another work entitled De Tomis seu Divisionibus is mentioned. It is not improbable however that this was merely another title for the Quaternuli. The effect of the order issued by the council was to cause all the writing of David to disappear. Thus his doctrines are derived from the assertions of his contemporaries and opponents notably Albert the Great and St. Thomas as mentioned above.

From these sources we learn that David was a Pantheist. He identified God with the material substratum of all things materia prima . He reduced all reality to three categories namely bodies minds and eternal substances. The indivisible substrate or constituent of bodies is matter ; of minds or souls intellect ; and of eternal substances God . These three matter intellect and God are one and the same. Consequently all things material intellectual and spiritual have one and the same essence God. The phraseology which must be Davids own as well as the title above mentioned De Tomis suggests the influence of Johannes Scotus Eriugena. Eriugenas work must have been widely known and read in the first decades of the thirteenth century as is evident from many undeniable facts. Whether David was influenced also by Amalric of Chartres is a matter of debate. Albert who was a contemporary of David says that David merely renewed the heresy of someone known as Alexander who taught that God and intellect and matter are one substance. It is impossible to determine whom Albert means by Alexander a disciple of Xenophanes; probably the reference is to some Arabian work that went under the name of a Greek philosopher. There were several works of that kind current in the early part of the thirteenth century. Some critics however put forward the surmise that Davids immediate source was Avicebrons Fons Vitæ or the work De Unitate written by Archdeacon Gundisalvi of Segovia who was well versed in Arabian philosophical literature. Whatever the source the doctrines were pantheistic as all authorities concur in describing them.

The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia takes a rather dim view of Davids philosophy and considers the harsh response understandable. It says

Historians have thought that the reason St. Albert and St. Thomas responded to David at all was not so much out of fear of Davids pantheism but rather to defend Aristotle. David strongly drew on Aristotles thoughts on prime matter and form and Albert and Thomas both of whom respected Aristotle wanted to show that Aristotles writings need not imply pantheism. To do this they had to dispute David lest the banning of Aristotles writings spread outside Paris."

Henri Delacroix,"Henri Delacroix was a French psychologist one of the most famous and most prolific French psychologists working at the beginning of century.

Born in Paris Henri Delacroix was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV and the Sorbonne gaining his agrégation in philosophy in 1894. After two years at the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelberg he became a professor at the Lycée de Pau He later became a professor and subsequently dean of the Faculty of Letters at the Sorbonne. He died in Paris."
Victor Delbos,"Victor Delbos was a Catholic philosopher and historian of philosophy.

Delbos was appointed a lecturer at the Sorbonne in 1902. In 1911 he became a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. He died in July 1916 as a result of an infectious myocarditis brought on by pleurisy. Maurice Blondel a close friend wrote an obituary account of Delbos and saw various posthumous publications through the press.

He wrote on Spinoza Nicolas Malebranche and Kant. A series of lectures on post-Kantian philosophy which Delbos viewed as shaped by contingent psychological and social factors rather than through the unfolding of some internal logic were published posthumously and later collected in a single volume."
Gilles Deleuze,"Gilles Deleuze was a French philosopher who from the early 1950s until his death in 1995 wrote on philosophy literature film and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus. An important part of Deleuzes oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers the Stoics Leibniz Hume Kant Nietzsche and Bergson with particular influence derived from Spinoza.A. W. Moore citing Bernard Williamss criteria for a great thinker ranks Deleuze among the greatest philosophers. Although he once characterized himself as a pure metaphysician his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities including philosophy art and literary theory as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.

Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life. His initial schooling was undertaken during World War II during which time he attended the Lycée Carnot. He also spent a year in khâgne at the Lycée Henri IV. During the Nazi occupation of France Deleuzes older brother Georges was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance and died while in transit to a concentration camp. In 1944 Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy such as Georges Canguilhem Jean Hyppolite Ferdinand Alquié and Maurice de Gandillac. Deleuzes lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers.

Deleuze passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1948 and taught at various lycées until 1957 when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953 he published his first monograph Empiricism and Subjectivity on David Hume. This monograph was based on his 1947 DES thesis roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis which was conducted under the direction of Jean Hyppolite and Georges Canguilhem. From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique. During this time he published the seminal Nietzsche and Philosophy and befriended Michel Foucault. From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the University of Lyon. In 1968 Deleuze defended his dissertations amid the ongoing May 68 demonstrations and later published his two dissertations Difference and Repetition and Expressionism in Philosophy Spinoza .

In 1969 he was appointed to the University of Paris VIII at VincennesSt. Denis an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of well-known academics including Foucault and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. Deleuze taught at Paris VIII until his retirement in 1987.

Deleuzes outlook in life was sympathetic with transcendental ideas nature as god ethics and the monist experience. Some of the important ideas he advocated for and found inspiration in include his personally coined expression pluralism monism as well as the concepts of Being and Univocity. His thoughts were shaped by Spinozas leanings and inclinations; for Deleuze Spinoza was the prince or even the Christ of philosophers.

He married Denise Paul Fanny Grandjouan in 1956 and they had two children.

According to James Miller Deleuze portrayed little visible interest in actually doing many of the risky things he so vividly conjured up in his lectures and writing. Married with two children he outwardly lived the life of a conventional French professor. He kept his fingernails untrimmed because as he once explained he lacked normal protective fingerprints and therefore could not touch an object particularly a piece of cloth with the pads of my fingers without sharp pain.

When once asked to talk about his life he replied Academics lives are seldom interesting. Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus

What do you know about me given that I believe in secrecy... If I stick where I am if I dont travel around like anyone else I make my inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions and express very obliquely and circuitously in what I write.... Arguments from ones own privileged experience are bad and reactionary arguments.

Deleuze who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age developed tuberculosis in 1968 and underwent lung removal. He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life. In the last years of his life simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. On 4 November 1995 he committed suicide throwing himself from the window of his apartment.

Before his death Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled La Grandeur de Marx and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled Ensembles and Multiplicities . He is buried in the cemetery of the village of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat.

Deleuzes works fall into two groups on one hand monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers and artists ; on the other eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept . However both of these aspects are seen by his critics and analysts as often overlapping in particular due to his prose and the unique mapping of his books that allow for multifaceted readings.

Deleuzes main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be summarized as an inversion of the traditional metaphysical relationship between identity and difference. Traditionally difference is seen as derivative from identity e.g. to say that X is different from Y assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities . To the contrary Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference Deleuze argues given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus. That is not only are no two things ever the same the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as X are composed of endless series of differences where X the difference between x and xdisplaystyle prime and xdisplaystyle prime the difference between... and so forth. Difference in other words goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly Deleuze argues we must grasp beings exactly as they are and concepts of identity fail to attain what he calls difference in itself. If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself according to what it is in its difference from everything it is not in other words in its internal difference.

Like Kant Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the subject. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea what Deleuze calls the virtual. While Deleuzes virtual ideas superficially resemble Platos forms and Kants ideas of pure reason they are not originals or models nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience the internal difference in itself. The concept they form is identical to its object. A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces times and sensations.

Thus Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a transcendental empiricism alluding to Kant. In Kants transcendental idealism experience only makes sense when organized by intuitions and concepts . Assuming the content of these intuitions and concepts to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access according to Kant spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs . Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea unfettered by our prior categories forcing us to invent new ways of thinking .

Simultaneously Deleuze claims that being is univocal i.e. that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ontological univocity from the medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus. In medieval disputes over the nature of God many eminent theologians and philosophers held that when one says that God is good Gods goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that God is good the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says Jane is good. That is God only differs from us in degree and properties such as goodness power reason and so forth are univocally applied regardless of whether one is talking about God a person or a flea.

Deleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is univocally difference. With univocity however it is not the differences which are and must be it is being which is Difference in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being. Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance God or Nature. For Deleuze there is no one substance only an always-differentiating process an origami cosmos always folding unfolding refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula pluralism monism.

Difference and Repetition is Deleuzes most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics but his other works develop similar ideas. In Nietzsche and Philosophy for example reality is a play of forces; in Anti-Oedipus a body without organs; in What is Philosophy a plane of immanence or chaosmos.

Deleuzes unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical epistemology or what he calls a transformation of the image of thought. According to Deleuze the traditional image of thought found in philosophers such as Aristotle René Descartes and Edmund Husserl misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discoverit may require a life of pure theorizing or rigorous computation or systematic doubtbut thinking is able at least in principle to correctly grasp facts forms ideas etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a Gods-eye neutral point of view but that is the ideal to approximate a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth Deleuze says we attain a thought without image a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. All this however presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. Its just like theology everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin the immaculate conception and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrationalnot sheltered from the irrational at all but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium and drift.

The Logic of Sense published in 1969 is one of Deleuzes most peculiar works in the field of epistemology. Michel Foucault in his essay Theatrum Philosophicum about the book attributed this to how he begins with his metaphysics but approaches it through language and truth; the book is focused on the simple condition that instead of denouncing metaphysics as the neglect of being we force it to speak of extrabeing. In it he refers to epistemological paradoxes in the first series as he analyzes Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland he remarks that the personal self requires God and the world in general. But when substantives and adjectives begin to dissolve when the names of pause and rest are carried away by the verbs of pure becoming and slide into the language of events all identity disappears from the self the world and God.

Deleuzes peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single correct interpretation but is instead to present a philosophers attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. Philosophers introduce new concepts they explain them but they dont tell us not completely anyway the problems to which those concepts are a response. The history of philosophy rather than repeating what a philosopher says has to say what he must have taken for granted what he didnt say but is nonetheless present in what he did say.

Likewise rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth reason or universals Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of concepts. For Deleuze concepts are not identity conditions or propositions but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking such as Platos ideas Descartess cogito or Kants doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created. In Deleuzes view then philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world .

In his later work Deleuze sharply distinguishes art philosophy and science as three distinct disciplines each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the speed of light or absolute zero . According to Deleuze none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another. For example Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time. Philosophy science and art are equally and essentially creative and practical. Hence instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as is it true or what is it Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical what does it do or how does it work

In ethics and politics Deleuze again echoes Spinoza albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a classical liberal model of society morality begins from individuals who bear abstract natural rights or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation . Guided by the naturalistic ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers.

In the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of desiring-production into the modern individual the nation-state and capitalism . Deleuze following Karl Marx welcomes capitalisms destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.

The first part of Capitalism and Schizophrenia undertakes a universal history and posits the existence of a separate socius for each mode of production the earth for the tribe the body of the despot for the empire and capital for capitalism.

In his 1990 essay Postscript on the Societies of Control Deleuze builds on Foucaults notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as masses samples data markets or banks. The mechanisms of modern societies of control are described as continuous following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records mobile location tracking and other personally identifiable information.

But how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or immanent to live well is to fully express ones power to go to the limits of ones potential rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality which is a flux of change and difference we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can becomethough we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice then is creativity. Herein perhaps lies the secret to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge it is not because everything is of equal value but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment in art could ever bear on the work to come

Deleuzes studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. In Nietzsche and Philosophy for example Deleuze claims that Nietzsches On the Genealogy of Morality is an attempt to rewrite Kants Critique of Pure Reason even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the Genealogy and the Genealogys moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kants book. Likewise Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinozas philosophy despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinozas works. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as buggery as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his yet also monstrous and different.

The various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuzes peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice. A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacons Study after Velázquezit is quite beside the point to say that Bacon gets Velasquez wrong. Similar considerations apply in Deleuzes view to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms pace critics such as Alan Sokal Im not saying that Resnais and Prigogine or Godard and Thom are doing the same thing. Im pointing out rather that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts since there are distinct concepts of these spaces.

Along with several French and Italian Marxist-inspired thinkers like Louis AlthusserÉtienne Balibar and Antonio Negri he was one of the central figures in a great flowering of Spinoza studies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries continental philosophy that was the second remarkable Spinoza revival in history after highly significant Neo-Spinozism in German philosophy and literature of approximately the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A fervent Spinozist in many respects Deleuzes preoccupation with and reverence for Spinoza are well known in contemporary philosophy.

In the 1960s Deleuzes portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of left-wing Nietzscheanism as an intellectual stance. His books Difference and Repetition and The Logic of Sense led Michel Foucault to declare that one day perhaps this century will be called Deleuzian. In the 1970s the Anti-Oedipus written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric offering a sweeping analysis of the family language capitalism and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud Marx Nietzsche and dozens of other writers was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of May 1968. In 1994 and 1995 LAbécédaire de Gilles Deleuze an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and Claire Parnet aired on Frances Arte Channel.

In the 1980s and 1990s almost all of Deleuzes books were translated into English. Deleuzes work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia . Like his contemporaries Foucault Jacques Derrida and Jean-François Lyotard Deleuzes influence has been most strongly felt in North American humanities departments particularly in literary theory where Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus are oft regarded as major statements of post-structuralism and postmodernism though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms. Likewise in the English-speaking academy Deleuzes work is typically classified as continental philosophy.

Deleuze has attracted critics as well. The following list is not exhaustive and gives only the briefest of summaries.

Among French philosophers Vincent Descombes argues that Deleuzes account of a difference that is not derived from identity is incoherent and that his analysis of history in Anti-Oedipus is utter idealism criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming. According to Pascal Engel Deleuzes metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system and so destroys meaning truth and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuzes metaphilosophy thus When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it.Alain Badiou claims that Deleuzes metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity remaining at bottom monist. Badiou further argues that in practical matters Deleuzes monism entails an ascetic aristocratic fatalism akin to ancient Stoicism.

Other European philosophers have criticized Deleuzes theory of subjectivity. For example Manfred Frank claims that Deleuzes theory of individuation as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness.Slavoj Žižek claims that Deleuzes ontology oscillates between materialism and idealism and that the Deleuze of Anti-Oedipus the political Deleuze under the bad influence of Guattari ends up despite protestations to the contrary as the ideologist of late capitalism. Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to just another substance and thereby failing to grasp the nothingness that according to Lacan and Žižek defines subjectivity. What remains worthwhile in Deleuzes oeuvre Žižek finds are precisely Deleuzes engagements with virtuality as the product of negativity.

English-speaking philosophers have also criticized aspects of Deleuzes work. Stanley Rosen objects to Deleuzes interpretation of Nietzsches eternal return.Todd May argues that Deleuzes claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence i.e. his monism. However May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis and accept a Wittgensteinian holism without significantly altering his practical philosophy.Peter Hallward argues that Deleuzes insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into and is supremely indifferent to the material actual conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuzes thought is literally other-worldly aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the theophanic self-creation of nature.

In Fashionable Nonsense physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they dont object to metaphorical reasoning including with mathematical concepts but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being abused by taking them out of their intended meaning rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the abuse of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuzes wider contributions.

Other scholars in continental philosophy feminist studies and sexuality studies have taken Deleuzes analysis of the sexual dynamics of sadism and masochism with a level of uncritical celebration following the 1989 Zone Books translation of the 1967 booklet on Leopold von Sacher-Masoch Le froid et le cruel . As sexuality historian Alison M. Moore notes Deleuzes own value placed on difference is poorly reflected in this booklet which fails to differentiate between Masochs own view of his desire and that imposed upon him by the pathologizing forms of psychiatric thought prevailing in the late nineteenth century which produced the concept of masochism ."
Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales,"Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales or Jean-Baptiste Isoard de Lisle was a French philosopher noted for his multi-edition multi-volume opus The Philosophy of Nature Treatise on Human Moral Nature.

De Sales taught for the Oratorians in Riom and Nantes until 1768 when he resigned to become an independent philosopher in Paris. His bookThe Philosophy of Nature was first published in 1770 and expanded over the years supposedly going through seven editions and increasing in size to up to a dozen volumes. It has been described as long-winded and conventional a hodgepodge of ideas.

De Sales challenged the young earth biblical 6000-year-old date of creation which was popular in his day instead believing on the basis of astronomical data that the earth was around 140000 years old and that it took 40062 years to cool down following its formation. He however rejected the three-million-year-old date of the earth which was taught in India at the time.

Beginning in 1776 a faction in the French court began a campaign against de Sales as a way of attacking the French philosophical movement more generally. Voltaire championed his defense but de Sales was imprisoned in March 1777 for publishing a book deemed to be anti-royalist an event that brought his works out of obscurity.De Sales became a supporter of the early philosophically-based stages of the French Revolution in 17891792. However by 1794 feeling the Revolution had discarded its underlying principles he returned to royalist sympathies and was arrested for publishing anti-Jacobin works. Unlike many he survived his arrest and the revolution."

Chantal Delsol was born into a right-wing Catholic Parisian family the daughter of biologist Michel Delsol. She studied under the liberal-conservative sociologist Julien Freund a disciple of Max Weber. She earned her docteur ès lettres under him in 1982.

She is currently a professor at Université de Marne-la-Vallée where she directs the centre for European studies known as the Hannah Arendt Institute which she founded in 1993.

Chantal Delsol is a strong supporter of European federalism an Idea she traces to Catholicism and the baroque culture of Germanic countries. As such she opposes Jean Bodins idea of the nation state which she believes results in geopolitical deadlock. A federation she argues is an indeterminate contract based on the common goal of peace and prosperity offering a greater degree of flexibility and thus a more fluid and open state.

She considers the current European Union not to be a true federation. Due to the lack of political unity in the EU the only unity is an administrative unity which she has described as technocratic. For example Europe lacks a common policy in terms of defence and foreign affairs.

For Delsol subsidiarity is a principle of social organization allowing for the separation of powers to different authorities.An authority responsible for a group is required to guarantee the existence of the object of the group. The authority is only required to help the group overcome its weaknesses no more and no less.

In her book titled La nature du populisme ou les figures de lidiot Chantal Delsol examines the stakes of contemporary populism i.e. the current resurgence of interest in the concept as well as the need to reevaluate our place in the contemporary world. To Delsol populism appears to be the greatest danger to democracy; on the other hand it reveals the flaws of western democracies owing to their ideas of universalism."
Jacques Derrida,"Jacques Derrida was an Algerian-born French philosopher best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction which he analyzed in numerous texts and developed in the context of phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.

During his career Derrida published more than 40 books together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He had a significant influence on the humanities and social sciences including philosophy literature lawanthropologyhistoriographyapplied linguisticssociolinguisticspsychoanalysis architecture and political theory.

His work retains major academic influence throughout the UScontinental Europe South America and all other countries where continental philosophy has been predominant particularly in debates around ontology epistemology ethics aesthetics hermeneutics and the philosophy of language. In most of the Anglosphere where analytic philosophy is dominant Derridas influence is most presently felt in literary studies due to his longstanding interest in language and his association with prominent literary critics from his time at Yale. He also influenced architecture musicart and art criticism.

Particularly in his later writings Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider Speech and Phenomena to be his most important work. Others cite Of Grammatology Writing and Difference and Margins of Philosophy . These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial.

Derrida was born on July 15 1930 in a summer home in El Biar Algeria into a Sephardic Jewish family that became French in 1870 when the Crémieux Decree granted full French citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. His parents Haïm Aaron Prosper Charles Derrida and Georgette Sultana Esther Safar named him Jackie which they considered to be an American name though he would later adopt a more correct version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor Jackie Coogan who had become well-known around the world via his role in the 1921 Charlie Chaplin film The Kid. He was also given the middle name Élie after his paternal uncle Eugène Eliahou at his circumcision; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings and he would later call it his hidden name.

Derrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Moïse died at less than three months old the year before Derrida was born leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother. Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.

On the first day of the school year in 1942 French administrators in Algeria implementing antisemitism quotas set by the Vichy governmentexpelled Derrida from his lycée. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lycée formed by displaced teachers and students and also took part in numerous football competitions . In this adolescent period Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers an instrument of revolt against family and society. His reading also included Camus and Sartre.

In the late 1940s he attended the Lycée Bugeaud on Edmund Husserl . He then passed the highly competitive agrégation exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at Harvard University and he spent the 195657 academic year reading James Joyces Ulysses at the Widener Library. In June 1957 he married the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier in Boston. During the Algerian War of Independence of 19541962 Derrida asked to teach soldiers children in lieu of military service teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959.

Following the war from 1960 to 1964 Derrida taught philosophy at the Sorbonne where he was an assistant of Suzanne Bachelard Georges Canguilhem Paul Ricœur and Jean Wahl. His wife Marguerite gave birth to their first child Pierre in 1963. In 1964 on the recommendation of Louis Althusser and Jean Hyppolite Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS which he kept until 1984. In 1965 Derrida began an association with the Tel Quel group of literary and philosophical theorists which lasted for seven years. Derridas subsequent distance from the Tel Quel group after 1971 was connected to his reservations about their embrace of Maoism and of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

With Structure Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on structuralism at Johns Hopkins University his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet Jacques Lacan and Paul de Man the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come. A second son Jean was born in 1967. In the same year Derrida published his first three booksWriting and Difference Speech and Phenomena and Of Grammatology.

In 1980 he received his first honorary doctorate and was awarded his State doctorate by submitting to the University of Paris ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title Linscription de la philosophie Recherches sur linterprétation de lécriture . The text of Derridas defense was based on an abandoned draft thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of Jean Hyppolite at the ENS entitled The Ideality of the Literary Object ; his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as The Time of a Thesis Punctuations. In 1983 Derrida collaborated with Ken McMullen on the film Ghost Dance. Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.

Derrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1984 . With François Châtelet and others he in 1983 co-founded the Collège international de philosophie an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 Sylviane Agacinski gave birth to Derridas third child Daniel.

On May 8 1985 Derrida was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to Class IV - Humanities Section 3 -Criticism and Philology.

In 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the University of California Irvine where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. After Derridas death his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCIs archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derridas widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvines collection although it dropped the suit in 2007.

Derrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities including Johns Hopkins University Yale University New York University Stony Brook University and The New School for Social Research.

He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Cambridge Columbia University The New School for Social Research the University of Essex Katholieke Universiteit Leuven the University of Silesia the University of Coimbra the University of Athens and many others around the world. In 2001 he received the Adorno-Preis from the University of Frankfurt.

Derridas honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition. Philosophers including Quine Marcus and Armstrong wrote a letter to the university objecting that Derridas work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour and Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason truth and scholarship is not we submit sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university.

Late in his life Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries Dailleurs Derrida by Safaa Fathy and Derrida by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman .

Derrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 which reduced his speaking and travelling engagements. He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of October 9 2004.

At the time of his death Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to Heidelberg as holder of the Gadamer professorship whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death. Peter Hommelhoff Rector at Heidelberg by that time would summarize Derridas place as Beyond the boundaries of philosophy as an academic discipline he was a leading intellectual figure not only for the humanities but for the cultural perception of a whole age.

Derrida referred to himself as a historian. He questioned assumptions of the Western philosophical tradition and also more broadly Western culture. By questioning the dominant discourses and trying to modify them he attempted to democratize the university scene and to politicize it. Derrida called his challenge to the assumptions of Western culture deconstruction. On some occasions Derrida referred to deconstruction as a radicalization of a certain spirit of Marxism.

With his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models to govern its conception of language and consciousness. He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a metaphysics of presence to which philosophy has bound itself. This logocentrism Derrida argues creates marked or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from our conception of speechs relation to writing to our understanding of racial difference. Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such metaphysics.

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is in a broad sense influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure considered to be one of the fathers of structuralism posited that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language.

Perhaps Derridas most quoted and famous assertion which appears in an essay on Rousseau in his book Of Grammatology is the statement that there is no out-of-context . Critics of Derrida have been often accused of having mistranslated the phrase in French to suggest he had written Il ny a rien en dehors du texte and of having widely disseminated this translation to make it appear that Derrida is suggesting that nothing exists but words. Derrida once explained that this assertion which for some has become a sort of slogan in general so badly understood of deconstruction ... means nothing else there is nothing outside context. In this form which says exactly the same thing the formula would doubtless have been less shocking.

Derrida began his career examining the limits of phenomenology. His first lengthy academic manuscript written as a dissertation for his diplôme détudes supérieures and submitted in 1954 concerned the work of Edmund Husserl. Gary Banham has said that the dissertation is in many respects the most ambitious of Derridas interpretations with Husserl not merely in terms of the number of works addressed but also in terms of the extraordinarily focused nature of its investigation. In 1962 he published Edmund Husserls Origin of Geometry An Introduction which contained his own translation of Husserls essay. Many elements of Derridas thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in Positions Derrida said 

In this essay the problematic of writing was already in place as such bound to the irreducible structure of deferral in its relationships to consciousness presence science history and the history of science the disappearance or delay of the origin etc. ... this essay can be read as the other side of Speech and Phenomena.

Derrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture Structure Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences delivered at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 . The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with structuralism then at the peak of its influence in France but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations; this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of post-structuralism.

The effect of Derridas paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970 the title of the collection had become The Structuralist Controversy. The conference was also where he met Paul de Man who would be a close friend and source of great controversy as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan with whose work Derrida had a mixed relationship.

In the early 1960s Derrida began speaking and writing publicly addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of structuralism which was being widely favoured as the successor to the phenomenology approach the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derridas countercurrent take on the issue at a prominent international conference was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a phenomenology vs structuralism debate.

Phenomenology as envisioned by Husserl is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individuals lived experience; for those with a more phenomenological bent the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis the process of its emergence from an origin or event. For the structuralists this was a false problem and the depth of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.

In that context in 1959 Derrida asked the question Must not structure have a genesis and must not the origin the point of genesis be already structured in order to be the genesis of something In other words every structural or synchronic phenomenon has a history and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis. At the same time in order that there be movement or potential the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity but must already be articulatedcomplexsuch that from it a diachronic process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original positing but more like a default of origin which Derrida refers to as iterability inscription or textuality. It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derridas work in motion and from which all of its terms are derived including deconstruction.

Derridas method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough careful sensitive and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity or intended sense . By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity which by definition cannot ever be completely known works its structuring and destructuring effects.

Derridas interests crossed disciplinary boundaries and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967 Speech and Phenomena Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference.

On several occasions Derrida has acknowledged his debt to Husserl and Heidegger and stated that without them he would not have said a single word. Among the questions asked in these essays are What is meaning what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric voice as a value of presence presence of the object presence of meaning to consciousness self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness In another essay in Writing and Difference entitled Violence and Metaphysics An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas the roots of another major theme in Derridas thought emerges the Other as opposed to the Same Deconstructive analysis deprives the present of its prestige and exposes it to something tout autre wholly other beyond what is foreseeable from the present beyond the horizon of the same. Other than Rousseau Husserl Heidegger and Levinas these three books discussed andor relied upon the works of many philosophers and authors including linguist SaussureHegelFoucaultBatailleDescartes anthropologist Lévi-Strauss paleontologist Leroi-Gourhan psychoanalyst Freud and writers such as Jabès and Artaud.

This collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derridas theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the Western intellectual tradition characterizing this tradition as a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning. The attempt to ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality was referred to by Heidegger as logocentrism and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is essentially logocentric and that this is a paradigm inherited from Judaism and Hellenism. He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic patriarchal and masculinist. Derrida contributed to the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in Western culture arguing that the whole philosophical tradition rests on arbitrary dichotomous categories and that any text contains implicit hierarchies by which an order is imposed on reality and by which a subtle repression is exercised as these hierarchies exclude subordinate and hide the various potential meanings. Derrida refers to his procedure for uncovering and unsettling these dichotomies as deconstruction of Western culture.

In 1968 he published his influential essay Platos Pharmacy in the French journal Tel Quel. This essay was later collected in Dissemination one of three books published by Derrida in 1972 along with the essay collection Margins of Philosophy and the collection of interviews entitled Positions.

Starting in 1972 Derrida produced on average more than one book per year. Derrida continued to produce important works such as Glas and The Post Card From Socrates to Freud and Beyond .

Derrida received increasing attention in the United States after 1972 where he was a regular visiting professor and lecturer at several major American universities. In the 1980s during the American culture wars conservatives started a dispute over Derridas influence and legacy upon American intellectuals and claimed that he influenced American literary critics and theorists more than academic philosophers.

On March 14 1987 Derrida presented at the CIPH conference entitled Heidegger Open Questions a lecture which was published in October 1987 as Of Spirit Heidegger and the Question. It follows the shifting role of Geist through Heideggers work noting that in 1927 spirit was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling. With his Nazi political engagement in 1933 however Heidegger came out as a champion of the German Spirit and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953. Derrida asks What of this meantime His book connects in a number of respects with his long engagement of Heidegger . He considers four guiding threads of Heideggerian philosophy that form the knot of this Geflecht the question of the question the essence of technology the discourse of animality and epochality or the hidden teleology or the narrative order.

Of Spirit contributes to the long debate on Heideggers Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer Victor Farías who charged that Heideggers philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the Nazi Sturmabteilung faction. Derrida responded to Farías in an interview Heidegger the Philosophers Hell and a subsequent article Comment donner raison How to Concede with Reasons He called Farías a weak reader of Heideggers thought adding that much of the evidence Farías and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.

Some have argued that Derridas work took a political and ethical turn in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include Force of Law as well as Specters of Marx and Politics of Friendship . Some refer to The Gift of Death as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work Derrida interprets passages from the Bible particularly on Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac and from Søren Kierkegaards Fear and Trembling.

However scholars such as Leonard Lawlor Robert Magliola and Nicole Anderson have argued that the turn has been exaggerated. Some including Derrida himself have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his political turn can be dated to earlier essays.

Derrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars Derrida was seriously criticized for this.

Derridas contemporary readings of Emmanuel Levinas Walter Benjamin Carl Schmitt Jan Patočka on themes such as law justice responsibility and friendship had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics literary criticism architecture film theory anthropology sociology historiography law psychoanalysis theology feminism gay and lesbian studies and political theory. Jean-Luc Nancy Richard Rorty Geoffrey Hartman Harold Bloom Rosalind Krauss Hélène Cixous Julia Kristeva Duncan Kennedy Gary Peller Drucilla Cornell Alan Hunt Hayden White Mario Kopić and Alun Munslow are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.

Derrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas funeral later published as Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas an appreciation and exploration of Levinass moral philosophy. Derrida used Bracha L. Ettingers interpretation of Lévinas notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively.

Derrida continued to produce readings of literature writing extensively on Maurice Blanchot Paul Celan and others.

In 1991 he published The Other Heading in which he discussed the concept of identity in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed the worst violences the crimes of xenophobia racism anti-Semitism religious or nationalist fanaticism.

At the 1997 Cerisy Conference Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of the autobiographical animal entitled The Animal That Therefore I Am . Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals the address has been seen as initiating a late animal turn in Derridas philosophy although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is present in his earliest writings.

Beginning with The Deaths of Roland Barthes in 1981 Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues many of them new engagements with their work. Memoires for Paul de Man a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derridas Wellek Lecture followed in 1986 with a revision in 1989 that included Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell Paul de Mans War. Ultimately fourteen essays were collected into The Work of Mourning which was expanded in the 2003 French edition Chaque fois unique la fin du monde to include essays dedicated to Gérard Granel and Maurice Blanchot.

In October 2002 at the theatrical opening of the film Derrida he said that in many ways he felt more and more close to Guy Debords work and that this closeness appears in Derridas texts. Derrida mentioned in particular everything I say about the media technology the spectacle and the criticism of the show so to speak and the markets the becoming-a-spectacle of everything and the exploitation of the spectacle. Among the places in which Derrida mentions the Spectacle is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.

Derrida engaged with many political issues movements and debates

Beyond these explicit political interventions however Derrida was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself within and beyond philosophy. Derrida insisted that a distinct political undertone had pervaded his texts from the very beginning of his career. Nevertheless the attempt to understand the political implications of notions of responsibility reason of state the other decision sovereignty Europe friendship difference faith and so on became much more marked from the early 1990s on. By 2000 theorizing democracy to come and thinking the limitations of existing democracies had become important concerns.

Crucial readings in his adolescence were Rousseaus Reveries of a Solitary Walker and Confessions André Gides journal La porte étroite Les nourritures terrestres and The Immoralist; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. The phrase Families I hate you in particular which inspired Derrida as an adolescent is a famous verse from Gides Les nourritures terrestres book IV. In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse also from book IV of the same Gide work I hated the homes the families all the places where man thinks hell find rest .

Other influences upon Derrida are Martin HeideggerPlato Søren Kierkegaard Alexandre Kojève Maurice Blanchot Antonin Artaud Roland Barthes Georges Bataille Edmund Husserl Emmanuel Lévinas Ferdinand de Saussure Sigmund Freud Karl Marx Claude Lévi-Strauss James Joyce Samuel Beckett J. L. Austin and Stéphane Mallarmé.

His book Adieu à Emmanuel Lévinas reveals his mentorship by this philosopher and Talmudic scholar who practiced the phenomenological encounter with the Other in the form of the Face which commanded human response. The use of deconstruction to read Jewish texts like the Talmud is relatively rare but has recently been attempted.

Derridas philosophical friends allies students and the heirs of Derridas thought include Paul de Man Jean-François Lyotard Michel Foucault Louis Althusser Emmanuel Levinas Maurice Blanchot Gilles Deleuze Jean-Luc Nancy Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe Sarah Kofman Hélène Cixous Bernard Stiegler Alexander García Düttmann Joseph Cohen Geoffrey Bennington Jean-Luc Marion Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak Raphael Zagury-Orly Jacques Ehrmann Avital Ronell Judith Butler Béatrice Galinon-Mélénec Ernesto Laclau Samuel Weber and Catherine Malabou.

Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe were among Derridas first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject and often also of a method they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida from the early 1970s.

Derrida wrote on both of them including a long book on Nancy Le Toucher Jean-Luc Nancy .

Derridas most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man which began with their meeting at Johns Hopkins University and continued until de Mans death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.

Shortly after de Mans death Derrida wrote the book Memoires pour Paul de Man and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal Critical Inquiry called Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell Paul de Mans War. The memoir became cause for controversy because shortly before Derrida published his piece it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the German occupation of Belgium including several that were explicitly antisemitic.

Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Mans writing. Some critics have found Derridas treatment of this issue surprising given that for example Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and in the 1960s broke with the Heidegger disciple Jean Beaufret over Beaufrets instances of antisemitism about which Derrida expressed shock.

Derridas criticism of Foucault appears in the essay Cogito and the History of Madness . It was first given as a lecture on March 4 1963 at a conference at Wahls Collège philosophique which Foucault attended and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.

In an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his History of Madness Foucault disputed Derridas interpretation of his work and accused Derrida of practicing a historically well-determined little pedagogy . A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text. According to historian Carlo Ginzburg Foucault may have written The Order of Things and The Archaeology of Knowledge partly under the stimulus of Derridas criticism. Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derridas criticism in Cogito and the History of Madness as facile nihilistic objections without giving further argumentation.

Geoffrey Bennington Avital Ronell and Samuel Weber belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derridas translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.

Having started as a student of de Man Gayatri Spivak took on the translation of Of Grammatology early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. Barbara Johnsons translation of Derridas Dissemination was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and Peggy Kamuf have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas and Pascale-Anne Brault.

Bennington Brault Kamuf Naas Elizabeth Rottenberg and David Wills are currently engaged in translating Derridas previously unpublished seminars which span from 1959 to 2003. Volumes I and II of The Beast and the Sovereign as well as The Death Penalty Volume I have appeared in English translation. Further volumes currently projected for the series include Heidegger The Question of Being and History Death Penalty Volume II Perjury and Pardon Volume I and Perjury and Pardon Volume II .

With Bennington Derrida undertook the challenge published as Jacques Derrida an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derridas work using the top two-thirds of every page while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Benningtons account . Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator noting at the end of the Applied Derrida conference held at the University of Luton in 1995 that everything has been said and as usual Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him which is impossible... so Ill try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again.

Derrida was familiar with the work of Marshall McLuhan and since his early 1967 writings he speaks of language as a medium of phonetic writing as the medium of the great metaphysical scientific technical and economic adventure of the West.

He expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what Derrida called McLuhans ideology about the end of writing. In a 1982 interview he said

I think that there is an ideology in McLuhans discourse that I dont agree with because hes an optimist as to the possibility of restoring an oral community which would get rid of the writing machines and so on. I think thats a very traditional myth which goes back to... lets say Plato Rousseau... And instead of thinking that we are living at the end of writing I think that in another sense we are living in the extension the overwhelming extension of writing. At least in the new sense... I dont mean the alphabetic writing down but in the new sense of those writing machines that were using now . And this is writing too.

And in his 1972 essay Signature Event Context he said

As writing communication if one insists upon maintaining the word is not the means of transport of sense the exchange of intentions and meanings the discourse and communication of consciousnesses. We are not witnessing an end of writing which to follow McLuhans ideological representation would restore a transparency or immediacy of social relations; but indeed a more and more powerful historical unfolding of a general writing of which the system of speech consciousness meaning presence truth etc. would only be an effect to be analyzed as such. It is this questioned effect that I have elsewhere called logocentrism.

Derrida had a direct impact on the theories and practices of influential architects Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi towards the end of the twentieth century. Derrida impacted a project that was theorized by Eisenman in Chora L Works Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman. This design was architecturally conceived by Tschumi for the Parc de la Villette in Paris which included a sieve or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the khôra. Moreover Derridas commentaries on Platos notion of khôra as set in the Timaeus received later reflections in the philosophical works and architectural writings of the philosopher-architect Nader El-Bizri within the domain of phenomenology.

Derrida used χώρα to name a radical otherness that gives place for being. El-Bizri built on this by more narrowly taking khôra to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings. El-Bizris reflections on khôra are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on dwelling and on being and space in Heideggers thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in architectural theory and in history of philosophy and science with a focus on geometry and optics. This also describes El-Bizris take on econtology as an extension of Heideggers consideration of the question of being by way of the fourfold of earth-sky-mortals-divinities ; and as also impacted by his own meditations on Derridas take on χώρα. Ecology is hence co-entangled with ontology whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinkingDerrida argued that the subjectile is like Platos khôra Greek for space receptacle or site. Plato proposes that khôra rests between the sensible and the intelligible through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example an image needs to be held by something just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida khôra defies attempts at naming or the eitheror logic which he deconstructed.

In a paper entitled GhostwritingGayatri Chakravorty Spivakthe translator of Derridas De la grammatologie into Englishcriticised Derridas understanding of Marx. Commenting on Derridas Specters of Marx Terry Eagleton wrote The portentousness is ingrained in the very letter of this book as one theatrically inflected rhetorical question tumbles hard on the heels of another in a tiresomely mannered syntax which lays itself wide open to parody.

Though Derrida addressed the American Philosophical Association on at least one occasion in 1988 and was highly regarded by some contemporary philosophers like Richard Rorty Alexander Nehamas and Stanley Cavell his work has been regarded by other analytic philosophers such as John Searle and Willard Van Orman Quine as pseudophilosophy or sophistry.

Some analytic philosophers have in fact claimed since at least the 1980s that Derridas work is not philosophy. One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derridas influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other humanities disciplines.

In his 1989 Contingency Irony and Solidarity Richard Rorty argues that Derrida purposefully uses words that cannot be defined and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derridas literary self. Rorty however argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the naïve positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.

Roger Scruton wrote in 2004 Hes difficult to summarise because its nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida there is no such thing as meaning it always eludes us and therefore anything goes.

On Derridas scholarship and writing style Noam Chomsky wrote I found the scholarship appalling based on pathetic misreading; and the argument such as it was failed to come close to the kinds of standards Ive been familiar with since virtually childhood. Well maybe I missed something could be but suspicions remain as noted.

Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt also criticized his work for misusing scientific terms and concepts in Higher Superstition The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science .

Three quarrels in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage the 197288 quarrel with John Searle the analytic philosophers pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.

In the early 1970s Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derridas deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derridas papers in the 1988 collection Limited Inc. Searle did not consider Derridas approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searles statement that It would be a mistake to regard Derridas discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions to which Derrida replied that that sentence was the only sentence of the reply to which I can subscribe. Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytical and continental philosophy.

The debate began in 1972 when in his paper Signature Event Context Derrida analyzed J. L. Austins theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austins departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes force Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a structure of absence and by iterability . Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction non-serious or parasitic speech wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning or simply due to a lack of interest. In his brief reply to Derrida Reiterating the Differences A Reply to Derrida Searle argued that Derridas critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austins theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austins inquiry. Searle agreed with Derridas proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. Searle also argued that Derridas disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austins typetoken distinction and his failure to understand Austins concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle by being so grounded in the analytical tradition that he was unable to engage with Derridas continental phenomenological tradition was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.

The substance of Searles criticism of Derrida in relation to topics in the philosophy of languagereferenced in Derridas Signature Event Contextwas that Derrida had no apparent familiarity with contemporary philosophy of language nor of contemporary linguistics in Anglo-Saxon countries. Searle explains When Derrida writes about the philosophy of language he refers typically to Rousseau and Condillac not to mention Plato. And his idea of a modern linguist is Benveniste or even Saussure. Searle describes Derridas philosophical knowledge as pre-Wittgensteinianthat is to say disconnected from analytic traditionand consequently in his perspective naive and misguided concerned with issues long-since resolved or otherwise found to be non-issues.

Searle also wrote in The New York Review of Books that he was surprised by the low level of philosophical argumentation the deliberate obscurantism of the prose the wildly exaggerated claims and the constant striving to give the appearance of profundity by making claims that seem paradoxical but under analysis often turn out to be silly or trivial.

Derrida in his response to Searle ridiculed Searles positions. Claiming that a clear sender of Searles message could not be established he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a société à responsabilité limitée due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searles reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not reply. Later in 1988 Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle reiterating that he found the constant appeal to normality in the analytical tradition to be problematic from which they were only paradigmatic examples.

In the description of the structure called normal normative central ideal this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility. The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic. It cannot be and hence ought not to be and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty. In the analysis of so-called normal cases one neither can nor ought in all theoretical rigor to exclude the possibility of transgression. Not even provisionally or out of allegedly methodological considerations. It would be a poor method since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensable about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general.

He continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between nonfiction or standard discourse and fiction defined as its parasite for part of the most original essence of the latter is to allow fiction the simulacrum parasitism to take place-and in so doing to de-essentialize itself as it were. He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become

In the debate Derrida praises Austins work but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls infelicities from the normal operation of language. One infelicity for instance occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is sincere or merely citational . Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily citational due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speakers inaccessible intention. Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance Derrida argues cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.

In 1994 Searle argued that the ideas upon which deconstruction is founded are essentially a consequence of a series of conceptual confusions made by Derrida as a result of his outdated knowledge or are merely banalities. He insisted that Derridas conception of iterability and its alleged corrupting effect on meaning stems from Derridas ignorance of the typetoken distinction that exists in current linguistics and philosophy of language. As Searle explains Most importantly from the fact that different tokens of a sentence type can be uttered on different occasions with different intentions that is different speaker meanings nothing of any significance follows about the original speaker meaning of the original utterance token.

In 1995 Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derridas conclusion preposterous and stated that Derrida as far as I can tell does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts... Searles reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate but to a mistranslation of the phrase il ny a pas de hors-texte which appears in Derridas Of Grammatology.

According to Searle the consistent pattern of Derridas rhetoric is announce a preposterous thesis e.g. there is no outside-text ; when challenged on respond that you have been misunderstood and revise the claim in such that it becomes a truism e.g. il ny a pas de hors-texte means nothing else there is nothing outside contexts; when the reformulation from is acknowledged then proceed as if the original formulation from was accepted. The revised ideafor example that everything exists in some contextis a banality but a charade ensues as if the original claimnothing exists outside of text had been established.

In 1992 some academics at Cambridge University mostly not from the philosophy faculty proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by among others the universitys Professor of Philosophy Hugh Mellor. Eighteen other philosophers from US Austrian Australian French Polish Italian German Dutch Swiss Spanish and British institutions including Barry Smith Willard Van Orman Quine David Armstrong Ruth Barcan Marcus and René Thom then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derridas work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour and describing Derridas philosophy as being composed of tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists. The letter concluded that

In the end the protesters were outnumbered336 votes to 204when Cambridge put the motion to a formal ballot; though almost all of those who proposed Derrida and who voted in favour were not from the philosophy faculty. Hugh Mellor continued to find the award undeserved explaining He is a mediocre unoriginal philosopher he is not even interestingly bad.

Derrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work was that it questioned and modified the rules of the dominant discourse it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene. To answer a question about the exceptional violence the compulsive ferocity and the exaggeration of the attacks he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case a sort of obsessive personality cult which philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate.

Richard Wolin has argued since 1991 that Derridas work as well as that of Derridas major inspirations leads to a corrosive nihilism. For example Wolin argues that the deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism.

In 1991 when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of The Heidegger Controversy Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation which was demonstrably execrable and weak simplistic and compulsively aggressive. As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of The Heidegger Controversy by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolins book by the Heideggerian scholar Thomas Sheehan that appeared in The New York Review of Books in which Sheehan characterised Derridas protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters. Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin in The Work of Intellectuals and the Press which was published in the book Points....

Twenty-four academics belonging to different schools and groups often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction signed a letter addressed to The New York Review of Books in which they expressed their indignation for the magazines behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.

Critical obituaries of Derrida were published in The New York TimesThe Economist and The Independent. The magazine The Nation responded to the New York Times obituary saying that even though American papers had scorned and trivialized Derrida before the tone seemed particularly caustic for an obituary of an internationally acclaimed philosopher who had profoundly influenced two generations of American humanities scholars.

Contrary to what some people believe or have an interest in making believe I consider myself very much a historian very historicist Deconstruction calls for a highly historians attitude .

I take great interest in questions of language and rhetoric and I think they deserve enormous consideration but there is a point where the authority of final jurisdiction is neither rhetorical nor linguistic nor even discursive. The notion of trace or of text is introduced to mark the limits of the linguistic turn. This is one more reason why I prefer to speak of mark rather than of language. In the first place the mark is not anthropological; it is prelinguistic; it is the possibility of language and it is everywhere there is a relation to another thing or relation to another. For such relations the mark has no need of language.

In language there are only differences. Even more important a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.

All these formulations have been possible thanks to the initial distinction between different irreducible types of genesis and structure worldly genesis and transcendental genesis empirical structure eidetic structure and transcendental structure. To ask oneself the following historico-semantic question What does the notion of genesis in general on whose basis the Husserlian diffraction could come forth and be understood mean and what has it always meant What does the notion of structure in general on whose basis Husserl operates and operates distinctions between empirical eidetic and transcendental dimensions mean and what has it always meant throughout its displacements And what is the historico-semantic relationship between Genesis and structure in general is not only simply to ask a prior linguistic question. It is to ask the question about the unity of the historical ground on whose basis a transcendental reduction is possible and is motivated by itself. It is to ask the question about the unity of the world from which transcendental freedom releases itself in order to make the origin of this unity appear.

Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an event if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structuralor structuralistthought to reduce or to suspect.

Between these two papers is staked Derridas philosophical ground if not indeed his step beyond or outside philosophy.

If the alterity of the other is posed that is only posed does it not amount to the same for example in the form of the constituted object or of the informed product invested with meaning etc. From this point of view I would even say that the alterity of the other inscribes in this relationship that which in no case can be posed. Inscription as I would define it in this respect is not a simple position it is rather that by means of which every position is of itself confounded inscription mark text and not only thesis or theme-inscription of the thesis.

On the phrase default of origin as applied to Derridas work cf. Bernard Stiegler Derrida and Technology Fidelity at the Limits of Deconstruction and the Prosthesis of Faith in Tom Cohen Jacques Derrida and the Humanities . Stiegler understands Derridas thinking of textuality and inscription in terms of a thinking of originary technicity and in this context speaks of the originary default of origin that arche-writing constitutes . See also Stiegler Technics and Time 1 The Fault of Epimetheus .

It is an opening that is structural or the structurality of an opening. Yet each of these concepts excludes the other. It is thus as little a structure as it is an opening; it is as little static as it is genetic as little structural as it is historical. It can be understood neither from a genetic nor from a structuralist and taxonomic point of view nor from a combination of both points of view.

And note that this complexity of the origin is thus not only spatial but temporal which is why différancedifférance is a matter not only of difference but of delay or deferral. One way in which this question is raised in relation to Husserl is thus the question of the possibility of a phenomenology of history which Derrida raises in Edmund Husserls Origin of Geometry An Introduction .

One of the more persistent misunderstandings that have thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derridas philosophical thought is the assumption shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics that within that thought just anything is possible. Derridas philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation traditional requirements of thought and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community. Undoubtedly some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect and may have contributed however obliquely to fostering to some extent that very misconception. But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derridas thinking reveals to even a superficial examination a well-ordered procedure a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions a marked thoroughness and regularity. ... Deconstruction must be understood we contend as the attempt to account in a certain manner for a heterogeneous variety or manifold of nonlogical contradictions and discursive equalities of all sorts that continues to haunt and fissure even the successful development of philosophical arguments and their systematic exposition."
John Theophilus Desaguliers,"John Theophilus Desaguliers FRS was a British natural philosopher clergyman engineer and freemason who was elected to the Royal Society in 1714 as experimental assistant to Isaac Newton. He had studied at Oxford and later popularized Newtonian theories and their practical applications in public lectures. Desagulierss most important patron was James Brydges 1st Duke of Chandos. As a Freemason Desaguliers was instrumental in the success of the first Grand Lodge in London in the early 1720s and served as its third Grand Master. 

Desaguliers was born in La Rochelle several months after his father Jean Desaguliers a Protestant minister had been exiled as a Huguenot by the French government. Jean Desaguliers was ordained as an Anglican by Bishop Henry Compton of London and sent to Guernsey. Meanwhile the baby was baptised Jean Théophile Desaguliers in the Protestant Temple in La Rochelle and he and his mother then escaped to join Jean in Guernsey.

In 1692 the family moved to London where Jean Desaguliers later set up a French school in Islington. He died in 1699. His son who now used the anglicised name John Theophilus attended Bishop Veseys Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield until 1705 when he entered Christ Church Oxford and followed the usual classical curriculum and graduated BA in 1709. He also attended lectures by John Keill who used innovative demonstrations to illustrate difficult concepts of Newtonian natural philosophy. When Keill left Oxford in 1709 Desaguliers continued giving the lectures at Hart Hall the forerunner of Hertford College Oxford. He obtained a masters degree there in 1712. In 1719 Oxford granted him the honorary degree of Doctor in Civil Laws after which he was often referred to as Dr Desaguliers. His doctorate was incorporated by Cambridge University in 1726.

Desaguliers was ordained as a deacon in 1710 at Fulham Palace and as a priest in 1717 at Ely Palace in London.

In 1712 Desaguliers moved back to London and advertised courses of public lectures in Experimental Philosophy. He was not the first to do this but became the most successful offering to speak in English French or Latin. By the time of his death he had given over 140 courses of some 20 lectures each on mechanics hydrostatics pneumatics optics and astronomy. He kept his lectures up to date published notes for his auditors and designed his own apparatus including a renowned planetarium to demonstrate the solar system and a machine to explain tidal motion. In 1717 Desaguliers lodged at Hampton Court and lectured in French to King George I and his family.

In 1714 Isaac Newton President of the Royal Society invited Desaguliers to replace Francis Hauksbee as demonstrator at the Societys weekly meetings; he was soon thereafter made a Fellow of the Royal Society. Desaguliers promoted Newtons ideas and maintained the scientific nature of the meetings when Hans Sloane took over the Presidency after Newton died in 1727. Desaguliers contributed over 60 articles to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. He received the Societys prestigious Copley Medal in 1734 1736 and 1741. The last award was for his summary of knowledge to date on the phenomenon of electricity. He had worked on this with Stephen Gray who at one time lodged at the Desaguliers home. Desagulierss Dissertation concerning Electricity in which he coined the terms conductor and insulator was awarded a gold medal by the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences.

James Brydges 1st Duke of Chandos appointed Desaguliers as his chaplain in 1716 but probably as much for his scientific expertise as his ecclesiastic duties. He was also gifted the living of St Lawrence Church Little Stanmore which was close to the Dukes mansion called Cannons then under construction at nearby Edgware. The church was rebuilt in the baroque style in 1715. As the chapel at Cannons was not completed until 1720 the church was the location of first performances of the so-called Chandos Anthems by George Frideric Handel who was in 171718 like Desaguliers a member of the Dukes household.

The Cannons estate benefited from Desaguliers scientific expertise which was applied to the elaborate water garden there. He was also technical adviser to an enterprise in which Chandos had invested the York Buildings Company which used steam-power to extract water from the Thames. In 1718 Desaguliers dedicated to the Duke his translation of Edme Mariottes treatise on the motion of water. It is perhaps no coincidence that in the summer of 1718 Handel composed his opera Acis and Galatea for performance at Cannons. In this work the hero Acis is turned into a fountain and since by tradition the work was first performed outside on the terraces overlooking the garden a connection with Desaguliers new water works seems probable.

Desaguliers advised the Duke of Chandos on many projects and appears to have been distracted from his parochial duties by his other interests. The Duke once complained that there were unreasonable delays in burying the dead but this was attributed to the curate who was left in charge of the church.

Desaguliers applied his knowledge to practical applications. As well as his interest in steam engines and hydraulic engineering he developed expertise in ventilation. He devised a more efficient fireplace which was used in the House of Lords and also invented the blowing wheel which removed stale air from the House of Commons for many years.Desaguliers studied the movements made by the human body when working as a machine. He befriended the strong man Thomas Topham and although there is no firm evidence that he used Topham as a body guard Desaguliers recorded several of the feats that he performed.

Desaguliers was a parliamentary adviser to the board concerned with the first Westminster Bridge. This much-needed second crossing of the Thames was not completed until 1750 after his death but construction work resulted in the demolition of Desagulierss home in Channel Row.

Desaguliers also made significant contributions to the field of tribology. He was the first to recognise the possible role of adhesion in the friction process. For this contribution he was named by Duncan Dowson as one of the 23 Men of Tribology.

Desaguliers was a member of the Lodge which met at the Goose and Gridiron tavern. This Lodge later known as the Lodge of Antiquity joined with three others lodges on 24 June 1717 to form what would become the Premier Grand Lodge of England. The new Grand Lodge grew rapidly as more lodges joined and Desaguliers is remembered as being instrumental in its early success. He became the third Grand Master in 1719 and was later three times Deputy Grand Master. He helped James Anderson draw up the rules in the Constitutions of the Freemasons published in 1723 and he was active in the establishment of masonic charity. During a lecture trip to the Netherlands in 1731 Desaguliers initiated into Freemasonry Francis Duke of Lorraine who later became Holy Roman Emperor. Desaguliers also presided when Frederick Prince of Wales became a Freemason in 1731 and he additionally became a chaplain to the Prince.

On 14 October 1712 John Theophilus Desaguliers married Joanna Pudsey daughter of William and Anne Pudsey of Kidlington near Oxford. For most of their married life the couple lived at Channel Row Westminster where Desaguliers gave the majority of his lectures. When forced to leave due to work on Westminster Bridge they separated and John Theophilus took lodgings at the Bedford Coffee House in Covent Garden and carried on his lectures there. The Desaguliers had four sons and three daughters for most of whom they acquired aristocratic godparents but only two children survived beyond infancy John Theophilus jnr graduated from Oxford became a clergyman and died childless while Thomas had a distinguished military career in the Royal Artillery rising to the rank of General. He became chief firemaster at the Arsenal Woolwich and seems to have been the first to be employed by the English army to apply scientific principles to the production of cannon and the powers of gunnery for which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. It was Thomas Desaguliers who in part designed and supervised the fireworks for the first performance of Handels Music for the Royal Fireworks in Green Park. He later became an equerry to King George III.

John Theophilus Desaguliers had long suffered from gout. He died at his lodgings in the Bedford Coffee House on 29 February 1744 and was buried on 6 March 1744 in a prestigious location within the Savoy Chapel in London. The chapel was probably chosen for its Huguenot associations and in memory of Desagulierss origins. The press announcements of his death referred to him as a gentleman universally known and esteemed. In his will Desaguliers left his estate to his elder son who organised the publication of the second edition of his Course of Experimental Philosophy. Although never a wealthy man he did not die in poverty as suggested by the oft-quoted but inaccurate lines of the poet James Cawthorn

These are taken from a long poem entitled The Vanity of Human Enjoyment in which the poet attempted to draw attention to the general lack of funding for men of science and not Desaguliers in particular.

There are two known engravings by Peter Pelham and by James Tookey taken from a lost portrait of Desaguliers painted in about 1725 by Hans Hysing and an engraving by R. Scaddon of a Thomas Frye painting also apparently lost which showed the subject as an old man in 1743. An engraving by Etienne-Jehandier Desrochers was almost certainly made in 1735 when Desaguliers was on his only visit to Paris. There is also an oil attributed to Jonathan Richardson.

Desaguliers wrote on many topics for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society produced several editions of notes for the auditors of his lectures and wrote occasional poetry. He translated technical works from French and Latin into English often adding his own comments. His own Course of Experimental Philosophy was translated into Dutch and French"
Jean-Toussaint Desanti,"Jean-Toussaint Desanti was a French educator and philosopher known for his work on both the philosophy of mathematics and phenomenology.

The son of Jean-François Desanti and Marie-Paule Colonna he was born in Ajaccio and studied the philosophy of mathematics with Jean Cavaillès. During World War II he was a member of the French Resistance associating with Jean-Paul Sartre and André Malraux. He joined the French Communist Party in 1943 with his wife Dominique remaining a member until 1956.

In 1950 he participated in the publication of Science bourgeoise et science proletarienne with Raymond Guyot Francis Cohen and Gérard Vassails. This book was part of a campaign by the French Communist Party to advocate support for Lysenkoism.

Also in 1956 he published his Introduction à lhistoire de la philosophie.

Desanti taught philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris at the Lycée Lakanal at the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud and at the Sorbonne. His students included Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser. In 1968 he published Les Idéalités mathématiques recherches épistémologiques sur le développement de la théorie des fonctions de variables réelles.

According to Etienne Balibar Desantis originality is to be found in his choice to set aside the traditional problems of the criteria or the status of mathematical truth whether in their Platonic or transcendental forms in order to attend to another question that of the mediations according to which a naive or elementary mathematical theory comes to open itself towards its own generalization and consequent re-foundation in more abstract terms.

He died less than three weeks after undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery in early 2002 in Paris."
René Descartes,"René Descartes ; Latinized Renatus Cartesius; 31 March 1596 11 February 1650 was a French philosopher mathematician and scientist who invented analytic geometry linking the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra. He spent a large portion of his working life in the Dutch Republic initially serving the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the Dutch Golden Age Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy and algebraic geometry.

Many elements of Descartes philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism the revived Stoicism of the 16th century or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy he differed from the schools on two major points first he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second he rejected any appeal to final ends divine or natural in explaining natural phenomena. In his theology he insists on the absolute freedom of Gods act of creation. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the Passions of the Soul an early modern treatise on emotions Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic as if no one had written on these matters before. His best known philosophical statement is cogito ergo sum found in Discourse on the Method and Principles of Philosophy .

Descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century. He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes Locke Berkeley and Hume. In the 17th-century Dutch Republic the rise of early modern rationalism as a highly systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history exerted an immense and profound influence on modern Western thought in general with the birth of two influential rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes and Spinoza namely Cartesianism and Spinozism. It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz who have given the Age of Reason its name and place in history. Leibniz Spinoza and Descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.

Descartes Meditations on First Philosophy continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system was named after him. He is credited as the father of analytic geometry the bridge between algebra and geometryused in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution.

René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine Province of Touraine France on 31 March 1596. His mother Jeanne Brochard died soon after giving birth to him and so he was not expected to survive. Descartes father Joachim was a member of the Parlement of Brittany at Rennes. René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots. In 1607 late because of his fragile health he entered the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Flèche where he was introduced to mathematics and physics including Galileos work. After graduation in 1614 he studied for two years at the University of Poitiers earning a Baccalauréat and Licence in canon and civil law in 1616 in accordance with his fathers wishes that he should become a lawyer. From there he moved to Paris.

I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world I spent the rest of my youth traveling visiting courts and armies mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it.

In accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618 Descartes joined as a mercenary the Protestant Dutch States Army in Breda under the command of Maurice of Nassau and undertook a formal study of military engineering as established by Simon Stevin. Descartes therefore received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics. In this way he became acquainted with Isaac Beeckman the principal of a Dordrecht school for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music . Together they worked on free fall catenary conic section and fluid statics. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.

While in the service of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria since 1619 Descartes was present at the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague in November 1620.

According to Adrien Baillet on the night of 1011 November 1619 while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau Descartes shut himself in a room with an oven to escape the cold. While within he had three dreams and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However it is speculated that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome. Upon exiting he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be for him the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his lifes work. Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon his famous I think therefore I am.

In 1620 Descartes left the army. He visited Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto then visited various countries before returning to France and during the next few years he spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii . He arrived in La Haye in 1623 selling all of his property to invest in bonds which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life. Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in 1627. In the fall of the same year in the residence of the papal nuncio Guidi di Bagno where he came with Mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist Nicolas de Villiers Sieur de Chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy Cardinal Bérulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the Inquisition.

Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628. In April 1629 he joined the University of Franeker studying under Adriaan Metius either living with a Catholic family or renting the Sjaerdemaslot. The next year under the name Poitevin he enrolled at Leiden University to study both mathematics with Jacobus Golius who confronted him with Pappuss hexagon theorem and astronomy with Martin Hortensius. In October 1630 he had a falling-out with Beeckman whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam he had a relationship with a servant girl Helena Jans van der Strom with whom he had a daughter Francine who was born in 1635 in Deventer. She died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.

Unlike many moralists of the time Descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francines death in 1640. According to a recent biography by Jason Porterfield Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man.Russell Shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartess work changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.

Despite frequent moves he wrote all of his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy. In 1633 Galileo was condemned by the Italian Inquisition and Descartes abandoned plans to publish Treatise on the World his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless in 1637 he published parts of this work in three essays Les Météores La Dioptrique and La Géométrie preceded by an introduction his famous Discours de la méthode . In it Descartes lays out four rules of thought meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation

The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not know to be such; that is to say carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.

In La Géométrie Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with Pierre de Fermat having been able to do so because his paper Introduction to Loci was published posthumously in 1679. This later became known as Cartesian Geometry.

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics treatise Meditationes de Prima Philosophia written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by Principia Philosophiae a kind of synthesis of the Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First Philosophy. In 1643 Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague settling in Egmond-Binnen.

Christia Mercer suggested that Descartes may have been influenced by Spanish author and Roman Catholic nun Teresa of Ávila who fifty years earlier published The Interior Castle concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth.

Descartes began a six-year correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence in 1649 he published Les Passions de lâme which he dedicated to the Princess. A French translation of Principia Philosophiae prepared by Abbot Claude Picot was published in 1647. This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In the preface to the French edition Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth better and more secure consisting in the search for first causes.

By 1649 Descartes had become one of Europes most famous philosophers and scientists. That year Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. Descartes accepted and moved to Sweden in the middle of winter. She was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish The Passions of the Soul.

He was a guest at the house of Pierre Chanut living on Västerlånggatan less than 500 meters from Tre Kronor in Stockholm. There Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian mercury barometer. Challenging Blaise Pascal Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather.

Descartes arranged to give lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday three times a week at 5 am in her cold and draughty castle. It soon became clear they did not like each other; she did not care for his mechanical philosophy nor did he share her interest in Ancient Greek. By 15 January 1650 Descartes had seen Christina only four or five times. On 1 February he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 February. The cause of death was pneumonia according to Chanut but peripneumonia according to Christinas physician Johann van Wullen who was not allowed to bleed him. 

E. Pies has questioned this account based on a letter by the Doctor van Wullen; however Descartes had refused his treatment and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since. In a 2009 book German philosopher Theodor Ebert argues that Descartes was poisoned by a Catholic missionary who opposed his religious views.

As a Catholic in a Protestant nation he was interred in a graveyard used mainly for orphans in Adolf Fredriks kyrka in Stockholm. His manuscripts came into the possession of Claude Clerselier Chanuts brother-in-law and a devout Catholic who has begun the process of turning Descartes into a saint by cutting adding and publishing his letters selectively. In 1663 the Pope placed Descartes works on the Index of Prohibited Books. In 1666 sixteen years after his death his remains were taken to France and buried in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. In 1671 Louis XIV prohibited all the lectures in Cartesianism. Although the National Convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the Panthéon he was reburied in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 1819 missing a finger and the skull. His skull is on display in the Musée de lHomme in Paris.

In his Discourse on the Method he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this he employs a method called hyperbolicalmetaphysical doubt also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or Cartesian doubt he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge. Descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in The Meditations on First Philosophy. He relates this to architecture the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes Aristotles foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.

Initially Descartes arrives at only a single first principle that he thinks. This is expressed in the Latin phrase in the Discourse on Method Cogito ergo sum . Descartes concluded if he doubted then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence that is in and of itself proof that he does exist. These two first principlesI think and I existwere later confirmed by Descartes clear and distinct perception as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles Descartes reasoned ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a thinking thing. Thinking is what he does and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines thought as what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it insofar as I am conscious of it. Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious. He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams and that ones mind cannot have been hijacked by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before ones senses.

And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.

In this manner Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge discarding perception as unreliable and instead admitting only deduction as a method.

Descartes influenced by the automatons on display throughout the city of Paris began to investigate the connection between the mind and body and how the two interact. His main influences for dualism were theology and physics. The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as Cartesian dualism his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies. In Meditations on First Philosophy Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body; thus Descartess dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of modes which are the ways in which substances exist. In Principles of Philosophy Descartes explained we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it whereas we cannot conversely understand the mode apart from the substance. To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction which Descartes explained as follows

The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is I make a mental abstraction.

According to Descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another. He argued that the great differences between body and mind make the two ontologically distinct. According to Descartes indivisibility argument the mind is utterly indivisible because when I consider the mind or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.

Moreover in The Meditations Descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substancesthe mind or soul defined as thinking and the body defined as matter and unthinking. The Aristotelian philosophy of Descartes days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the final cause and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of Kepler and Galileo which denied the role of a divine power and final causes in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe in favor of the mind . Therefore while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul.

Descartes dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body but the body could not exist without the mind. In The Meditations Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance the body is composed only of accidents. But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined

Nature also teaches me by the sensations of pain hunger thirst and so on that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship but that I am very closely joined and as it were intermingled with it so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so I who am nothing but a thinking thing would not feel pain when the body was hurt but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.

Descartes discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person Therefore Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mindbody problem for many years after Descartes death. Descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas. Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher John Locke an empiricist.Empiricism holds that all knowledge is acquired through experience.

In The Passions of the Soul published in 1649 Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions wonder love hatred desire joy and sadness. All of these passions he argued represented different combinations of the original spirit and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued for example that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector. Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on Gods will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century reflex theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. For example heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire. Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.

Above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous In the 20th century Alan Turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist Ivan Pavlov was a great admirer of Descartes.

For Descartes ethics was a science the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences ethics had its roots in metaphysics. In this way he argues for the existence of God investigates the place of man in nature formulates the theory of mindbody dualism and defends free will. However as he was a convinced rationalist Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good choices and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia and as a result wrote his work The Passions of the Soul that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man with an emphasis on emotions or passions. His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be specifically how it should invoke emotion.

Humans should seek the sovereign good that Descartes following Zeno identifies with virtue as this produces blessedness. For Epicurus the sovereign good was pleasure and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zenos teaching because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding Aristotles opinion that happiness depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth Descartes does not deny that fortunes contribute to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside ones own control whereas ones mind is under ones complete control. The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life but earlier in his Discourse on the Method he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his Provisional Morals.

In the third and fifth Meditation Descartes offers proofs of a benevolent God . Because God is benevolent Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him for God has provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition however Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception. Regarding epistemology therefore Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes however was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.

Descartes invokes his causal adequacy principle to support his trademark argument for the existence of God quoting Lucretius in defence Ex nihilo nihil fit meaning Nothing comes from nothing .Oxford Reference summarises the argument as follows that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker. In the fifth Meditation Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite and suggests that of all the ideas that are in me the idea that I have of God is the most true the most clear and distinct. Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic and one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. Pascal regarded Descartes views as a rationalist and mechanist and accused him of deism I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that he had no more use for God while a powerful contemporary Martin Schoock accused him of atheist beliefs though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his Meditations. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663. Descartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism. Through this method of scepticism he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words certainty. He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses and according to Descartes this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind and thus an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted and that God has given him the propensity to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true substance. But minds are substances meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.

Descartes steered clear of theological questions restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances he replied I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God.

Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences. For him philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge as he related in a letter to a French translator

Thus all Philosophy is like a tree of which Metaphysics is the root Physics the trunk and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk which are reduced to three principals namely Medicine Mechanics and Ethics. By the science of Morals I understand the highest and most perfect which presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences is the last degree of wisdom.

Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence. He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions but these could be explained mechanistically. Whereas humans had a soul or mind and were able to feel pain and anxiety animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent. Although Descartes views were not universally accepted they became prominent in Europe and North America allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century. The publications of Charles Darwin would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals. Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer.

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for modernity. The first two of his Meditations on First Philosophy those that formulate the famous methodic doubt represent the portion of Descartess writings that most influenced modern thinking. It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move. In shifting the debate from what is true to of what can I be certain Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity while the traditional concept of truth implies an external authority certainty instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an anthropocentric revolution the human being is now raised to the level of a subject an agent an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity the repercussions of which are still being felt the emancipation of humanity from Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand. In modernity the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings each of whom is a self-conscious shaper and guarantor of their own reality. In that way each person is turned into a reasoning adult a subject and agent as opposed to a child obedient to God. This change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the Christian medieval period to the modern period a shift that had been anticipated in other fields and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by Descartes.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartess work establishing human reason as autonomous provided the basis for the Enlightenments emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger the perspective of Descartess work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology. Descartess philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism.

One of Descartess most enduring legacies was his development of Cartesian or analytic geometry which uses algebra to describe geometry. Descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x y and z and knowns by a b and c. He also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents; for example the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared. He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning particularly about abstract unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as Pacioli Cardan Tartaglia and Ferrari. Equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal because a three-dimensional form such as a cube occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity a2 could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as François Viète who insisted that a second power must represent an area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject he preceded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or universal mathematics as a precursor to symbolic logic that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically and mechanize general reasoning.

Descartess work provided the basis for the calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics. His rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

The beginning to Descartess interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician Isaac Beeckman who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy. With this foundation of reasoning Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics. Descartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line as opposed to perfect circular motion as Galileo had envisioned it. He outlined his views on the universe in his Principles of Philosophy where he describes his three laws of motion. 

Descartes also made contributions to the field of optics. He showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees . He also independently discovered the law of reflection and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.

Current popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Isaac Newton and this is arguably one of his most important contributions. Decartes influence extended not directly from his original French edition of La Géométrie however but rather from Frans van Schootens expanded second Latin edition of the work. Newton continued Descartes work on cubic equations which freed the subject from fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables. Newton rejected Descartes vortex theory of planetary motion in favor of his law of universal gravitation and most of the second book of Newtons Principia is devoted to his counterargument.

In commercial terms The Discourse appeared during Descartess lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The Meditations which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartess death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was however eagerly sought out by Europes scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.

Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht was condemned by the Rector of the university Gijsbert Voet for teaching Descartess physics.

The membership of Descartes to the Rosicrucians is debated.

The initials of his name have been linked to the R.C. acronym widely used by Rosicrucians. Furthermore in 1619 Descartes moved to Ulm which was a well renowned international center of the Rosicrucian movement.During his journey in Germany Descartes met Johannes Faulhaber who had previously expressed his personal commitment to join the brotherhood.

Descartes dedicated the work titled The Mathematical Treasure Trove of Polybius Citizen of the World to learned men throughout the world and especially to the distinguished B.R.C. in Germany. The work wasnt completed and its publication is uncertain.

In January 2010 a previously unknown letter from Descartes dated 27 May 1641 was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through Google. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by Haverford College in Haverford Pennsylvania. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.

Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern metaphysics.

The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two Meditations someone proccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.

Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go the great discovery he had in his hands.

For up to Descartes...a particular sub-iectum...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a sub-iectum...arises out of the claim of man to a...self-supported unshakeable foundation of truth in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.

With the interpretation of man as subiectum Descartes creates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency.

When with the beginning of modern times religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention men of intellect were lifted by a new belief their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science. in philosophy the Meditations were epoch-making in a quite unique sense and precisely because of their going back to the pure ego cogito. Descartes work has been used in fact to inaugurates an entirely new kind of philosophy. Changing its total style philosophy takes a radical turn from naïve objectivism to transcendental subjectivism."
Léger Marie Deschamps,"Léger Marie Deschamps Benedictine monk known under his Benedictine name of Dom Deschamps was a French philosopher and utopian socialist who taught a form of modified Spinozism.

During his lifetime he published very little but corresponded with most of the leaders of the French Enlightenment. Rediscovered in 1862 he was hailed as a precursor of Hegel. His metaphysical system anticipates Hegel by asserting that truth includes contradictory elements and he had much to say about how the concept Being collapses into that of Nothing. There was a further revival of interest in his work after 1974 and his collected works were finally published in 1993.

Vincent Descombes,"Vincent Descombes is a French philosopher. His major work has been in the philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.

Descombes is particularly noted for a lengthy critique in two volumes of the project he calls cognitivism and which is roughly the view current in philosophy of mind that mental and psychological facts can ultimately be treated as or reduced to physical facts about the brain.

Descombes has also written an introduction to modern French philosophy focused on the transition after 1960 from a focus on the three Hs Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger to the three masters of suspicion Karl Marx Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. In the same book he introduced the term post-Kojèvian discourse to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s .

Descombes teaches at the Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron part of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. He holds an appointment in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.

Descombes was a member of the French libertarian socialist group Socialisme ou Barbarie."
Antoine Destutt de Tracy,"Antoine Louis Claude Destutt comte de Tracy was a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher who coined the term ideology.

The son of a distinguished soldier Claude Destutt he was born in Paris. His family was of Scottish descent tracing its origin to Walter Stutt who had accompanied the Earls of Buchan and Douglas to the court of France in 1420 and whose family afterwards rose to be counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the University of Strasbourg where he was noted for his athletic skill. He went into the army and when the French Revolution broke out he took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. Elected a deputy of the nobility to the estates-general he sat alongside his friend the Marquis de La Fayette. In the spring of 1792 he received the rank of maréchal de camp in command of the cavalry in the army of the north but the influence of the extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of absence and settled at Auteuil where with Condorcet and Cabanis he devoted himself to scientific studies. Under the Reign of Terror he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a year during which he studied Étienne Bonnot de Condillac and John Locke and abandoned the natural sciences for philosophy.

In 1795 he was named associate of the Institut de France when it was first established. On the motion of Cabanis he was named in the class of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract attention by the memoires which he read before his colleaguespapers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work on ideology named Eléments didéologie. He conceived of ideology as the science of ideas. The society of ideologists at Auteuil embraced besides Cabanis and Tracy Constantin-François de Chassebœuf Comte de Volney and Dominique Joseph Garat professor in the National Institute. Along with some of these colleagues he was a member of the cultural society Les Neuf Sœurs. In 1806 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

Under the Empire Tracy was a member of the senate but he took little part in its deliberations. Under the Restoration he became a peer of France but protested against the reactionary split of the government and remained in opposition. In 1808 he was elected a member of the Académie française in place of Cabanis and in 1832 was also named a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. He appeared only once at its conferences owing to his age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his work. Destutt de Tracy was one of the principal advocates of liberalism during and after the Revolution. He died in Paris.

Destutt de Tracy was the last eminent representative of the sensualistic school which Condillac founded in France upon a one-sided interpretation of Locke. In full agreement with the materialist views of Cabanis de Tracy pushed the sensualist principles of Condillac to their most necessary consequences. While the attention of Cabanis was devoted mostly to the physiological side of man Tracys interests concerned the then newly determined ideological in contrast to psychological sides of humanity. His grounding notion of ideology he frankly stated fell as a part of zoology . The four faculties into which de Tracy divides the conscious lifeperception memory judgment and volitionare all varieties of sensation. Perception is sensation caused by a present affection of the external extremities of the nerves; memory is sensation caused in the absence of present excitation by dispositions of the nerves which are the result of past experiences; judgment is the perception of relations between sensations and is itself a species of sensation because if we are aware of the sensations we must be aware also of the relations between them; and volition he identifies with the feeling of desire and is therefore included as a type of sensation.

Considered for the influences of his philosophy de Tracy minimally deserves credit for his distinction between active and passive touch which ultimately fed the development of psychological theories of muscular sense. His account of the notion of external existence as it derived not from pure sensation but from the experience of action on the one hand and resistance on the other stands in this light to be compared with the works of Alexander Bain and later psychologists.

His chief works are the five-volume Éléments didéologie the first volume of which was presented as Ideology Strictly Defined and which completed the arguments made in earlier completed monographs; Commentaire sur lesprit des lois de Montesquieu and Essai sur le génie et les ouvrages de Montesquieu . The fourth volume of the Eléments didéologie the author regarded as the introduction to a second section of the planned nine-part work which he titled Traité de la volonté . When translated into English editor Thomas Jefferson retitled the volume A Treatise on Political Economy which obscured the aspects of Tracys concern not with politics but with far more basic questions of will and the possibility of understanding the conditions of its determinations.

Tracy advanced a rigorous use of deductive method in social theory seeing economics in terms of actions and exchanges . Tracys influence can be seen both on the Continent particularly on Stendhal Augustin Thierry Auguste Comte and Charles Dunoyer and in the United States where the general approach of the French Liberal School of political economy competed evenly with British classical political economy well until the end of the 19th century as evidence in the work and reputation of Arthur Latham Perry and others. In his political writings Tracy rejected monarchism favoring the American republican form of government. This republicanism as well as his advocacy of reason in philosophy and laissez-faire for economic policy lost him favor with Napoleon who turned Tracys coinage of ideology into a term of abuse. Karl Marx followed this vein of invective to refer to Tracy as a fischblütige Bourgeoisdoktrinär .

On the other hand Thomas Jefferson thought highly enough of Destutt de Tracys work to ready two of his manuscripts for American publication. In his preface to the 1817 publication Jefferson wrote By diffusing sound principles of Political Economy it will protect the public industry from the parasite institutions now consuming it. Tracys criticism of Montesquieu and his endorsement of representative democracy were influential on Jeffersons thinking.

Stendhal was much influenced by Tracys enlightenment ideals and attended the de Tracy salon regularly in the 1820s as he described in Memoirs of an Egotist. According to Richard Stites he was important to the liberals of the 1820s

Franco Venturi noted that the Commentary resounded throughout the whole period of the liberal revolutions from the Spain of 1820 to the Russia of 1825. An American historian wrote that the Russian Decembrists along with numerous other liberals Carbonari and revolutionaries of the 1820s used this Commentary as their political Bible. The Decembrist Mikhail Orlov recalled that his circle considered it the epitome of wisdom."
Théodore Dézamy,"Alexandre Théodore Dézamy was a French socialist a representative of the Neo-Babouvist tendency in early French communism along with Albert Laponneraye Richard Lahautière Jacques Pillot and others. He was also an early associate of Louis-Auguste Blanqui. He and his colleagues formed a link between the extreme left wing of the French Revolution and Marxism.

Alexandre Théodore Dézamy was born in Luçon . He worked as a schoolteacher in Luçon before moving to Paris in the 1830s where he became superintendent of a rooming house. Dézamy had already been developing ideas for a reorganisation of society on republican communalistic and collectivist principles. He admired Gracchus Babeuf and Philippe Buonarroti and was influenced by the writing of the utopian communist Étienne Cabet. In Paris he joined Cabets association and for a time worked as his secretary. He also contributed to Cabets journal Le Populaire. Dézamy also made contact with several revolutionary secret societies. In particular he joined the Society of the Season of Auguste Blanqui and Armand Barbès which carried out an unsuccessful insurrection in 1839. Blanqui and Barbès went to prison where they became enemies. Dézamy was arrested but in 1840 he was free and collaborated with Jacques Pillot and others in organising the first communist banquet at Belleville. 

Dézamy subsequently broke with Cabet whom he considered too opportunistic and reformist; instead of appealing to the bourgeoisie for sympathy with the proletariat as Cabet was doing Dézamy thought the workers should organise themselves and achieve their own liberation. Instead of hoping for reforms from a benevolent monarch workers should support a revolution and the establishment of a unitary centralised egalitarian republic. Dézamy also deplored Cabets religiosity seeing the Church as an enemy of the people. He envisaged a republic of federated communes each comprising about 10000 people and combining industrial agricultural and cultural work. Private property was to be abolished; work was to be assigned on the basis of ability; goods were to be distributed on the basis of need. Dézamy combined this social system with militant anti-clericalism atheism and a materialist metaphysics derived from dHolbach. Dézamy called his system unitary communism and propagated it in his own journal LÉgalitaire. In 1842 he published his best-known book Code de la Communauté. In The Holy Family Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote that the more scientific French Communists Dézamy Gay and others developed the teaching of materialism as the teaching of real humanism and the logical basis of communism.

In 1846 Dézamy founded his own association the Egalitarian Communists. They devoted themselves to revolutionary propaganda and education among workers in preparation for a revolution and the establishment of a communitarian society. They also tried to combat the influence of religious and reformist communists like Cabet and Lamennais. When the Revolution of 1848 occurred Dézamy joined the newly liberated Blanqui in founding the Central Republican Society one of the most radical republican socialist clubs of the period. Dézamy also launched a new journal Les Droits de lHomme with the slogan Liberty Equality Fraternity Association Alliance of Peoples. He also stood for elections to the National Assembly.

Louis Bonaparte became President in 1849 and the Second Republic took an increasingly conservative turn with the Second Empire looming on the horizon. Dézamy returned to Luçon where he died aged 42. Besides Babeuf and Cabet his ideas were also influenced by the eighteenth-century utopians Morelly and Mably and by Charles Fourier.

Denis Diderot,"Denis Diderot was a French philosopher art critic and writer best known for serving as co-founder chief editor and contributor to the Encyclopédie along with Jean le Rond dAlembert. He was a prominent figure during the Age of Enlightenment.

Diderot initially studied philosophy at a Jesuit college then considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734 his father disowned him. He lived a bohemian existence for the next decade. In the 1740s he wrote many of his best-known works in both fiction and non-fiction including the 1748 novel The Indiscreet Jewels.

In 1751 Diderot co-created the Encyclopédie with Jean le Rond dAlembert. It was the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors and the first to describe the mechanical arts. Its secular tone which included articles skeptical about Biblical miracles angered both religious and government authorities; in 1758 it was banned by the Catholic Church and in 1759 the French government banned it as well although this ban was not strictly enforced. Many of the initial contributors to the Encyclopédie left the project as a result of its controversies and some were even jailed. DAlembert left in 1759 making Diderot the sole editor. Diderot also became the main contributor writing around 7000 articles. He continued working on the project until 1765. He was increasingly despondent about the Encyclopédie by the end of his involvement in it and felt that the entire project might have been a waste. Nevertheless the Encyclopédie is considered one of the forerunners of the French Revolution.

Diderot struggled financially throughout most of his career and received very little official recognition of his merit including being passed over for membership in the Académie française. His fortunes improved significantly in 1766 when Empress Catherine the Great who heard of his financial troubles paid him 50000 francs to serve as her librarian. He remained in this position for the rest of his life and stayed a few months at her court in Saint Petersburg in 1773 and 1774.

Diderots literary reputation during his life rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the Encyclopédie; many of his most important works including Jacques the Fatalist Rameaus Nephew Paradox of the Actor and DAlemberts Dream were published only after his death.

Denis Diderot was born in Langres Champagne. His parents were Didier Diderot a cutler maître coutelier and Angélique Vigneron . Three of five siblings survived to adulthood Denise Diderot and their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot and finally their sister Angélique Diderot . According to Arthur McCandless Wilson Denis Diderot greatly admired his sister Denise sometimes referring to her as a female Socrates.

Diderot began his formal education at a Jesuit college in Langres earning a Master of Arts degree in philosophy in 1732. He then entered the Collège dHarcourt of the University of Paris. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy in 1735 and instead decided to study at the Paris Law Faculty. His study of law was short-lived however and in the early 1740s he decided to become a writer and translator. Because of his refusal to enter one of the learned professions he was disowned by his father and for the next ten years he lived a bohemian existence.

In 1742 he befriended Jean-Jacques Rousseau whom he met while watching games of chess and drinking coffee at the Café de la Régence. In 1743 he further alienated his father by marrying Antoinette Champion a devout Roman Catholic. The match was considered inappropriate due to Champions low social standing poor education fatherless status and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. The marriage in October 1743 produced one surviving child a girl. Her name was Angélique named after both Diderots dead mother and sister. The death of his sister a nun in her convent may have affected Diderots opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun La Religieuse in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a convent where she suffers at the hands of the other nuns in the community.

Diderot had affairs with Mlle. Babuti Madeleine de Puisieux Sophie Volland and Mme de Maux. His letters to Sophie Volland are known for their candor and are regarded to be among the literary treasures of the eighteenth century.

Diderots earliest works included a translation of Temple Stanyans History of Greece ; with two colleagues François-Vincent Toussaint and Marc-Antoine Eidous he produced a translation of Robert Jamess Medicinal Dictionary . In 1745 he published a translation of Shaftesburys Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit to which he had added his own reflections.

In 1746 Diderot wrote his first original work the Philosophical Thoughts . In this book Diderot argued for a reconciliation of reason with feeling so as to establish harmony. According to Diderot without feeling there is a detrimental effect on virtue and no possibility of creating sublime work. However since feeling without discipline can be destructive reason is necessary to control feeling.

At the time Diderot wrote this book he was a deist. Hence there is a defense of deism in this book and some arguments against atheism. The book also contains criticism of Christianity.

In 1747 Diderot wrote The Skeptics Walk in which a deist an atheist and a pantheist have a dialogue on the nature of divinity. The deist gives the argument from design. The atheist says that the universe is better explained by physics chemistry matter and motion. The pantheist says that the cosmic unity of mind and matter which are co-eternal and comprise the universe is God. This work remained unpublished till 1830. Accounts differ as to why. It was either because the local police warned by the priests of another attack on Christianity seized the manuscript; or because the authorities forced Diderot to give an undertaking that he would not publish this work.

In 1748 Diderot needed to raise money on short notice. He had become a father through his wife and his mistress Mme. de Puisieux was making financial demands from him. At this time Diderot had stated to Mme. de Puisieux that writing a novel was a trivial task whereupon she challenged him to write a novel. In response Diderot wrote his novel The Indiscreet Jewels . The book is about the magical ring of a Sultan which induces any womans discreet jewels to confess their sexual experiences when the ring is pointed at them. In all the ring is pointed at thirty different women in the bookusually at a dinner or a social meetingwith the Sultan typically being visible to the woman. However since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required a few of the sexual experiences recounted are through direct observation with the Sultan making himself invisible and placing his person in the unsuspecting womans boudoir.

Besides the bawdiness there are several digressions into philosophy music and literature in the book. In one such philosophical digression the Sultan has a dream in which he sees a child named Experiment growing bigger and stronger till it demolishes an ancient temple named Hypothesis. The book proved to be lucrative for Diderot even though it could only be sold clandestinely. It is Diderots most published work.

The book is believed to be an imitation of Le Sopha.

Diderot would keep writing on science in a desultory way all his life. The scientific work of which he was most proud was Memoires sur differents sujets de mathematique . This work contains original ideas on acoustics tension air resistance and a project for a new organ which could be played by all. Some of Diderots scientific works were applauded by contemporary publications of his time like The Gentlemans Magazine the Journal des savants; and the Jesuit publication Journal de Trevoux which invited more such work on the part of a man as clever and able as M. Diderot seems to be of whom we should also observe that his style is as elegant trenchant and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious.

On the unity of nature Diderot wrote Without the idea of the whole philosophy is no more and Everything changes; everything passes; nothing remains but the whole. He wrote of the temporal nature of molecules and rejected emboîtement the view that organisms are pre-formed in an infinite regression of non-changing germs. He saw minerals and species as part of a spectrum and was fascinated with hermaphroditism. His answer to the universal attraction in corpuscular physics models was universal elasticity. His view of natures flexibility foreshadows the discovery of evolution but it is not Darwinistic in a strict sense.

Diderots celebrated Letter on the Blind introduced him to the world as an original thinker. The subject is a discussion of the relation between reasoning and the knowledge acquired through perception . The title of his book also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were the blind under discussion. In the essay blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson argues that since knowledge derives from the senses mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree on. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch. According to Jonathan Israel what makes the Lettre sur les aveugles so remarkable however is its distinct if undeveloped presentation of the theory of variation and natural selection.

This powerful essay for which La Mettrie expressed warm appreciation in 1751 revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher Saunderson rejects the arguments of a deist clergyman who endeavours to win him round to a belief in a providential God during his last hours. Saundersons arguments are those of a neo-Spinozist Naturalist and fatalist using a sophisticated notion of the self-generation and natural evolution of species without Creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of thinking matter is upheld and the argument from design discarded as hollow and unconvincing. The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749 and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot who had been under police surveillance since 1747 was swiftly identified as the author had his manuscripts confiscated and was imprisoned for some months under a lettre de cachet on the outskirts of Paris in the dungeons at Vincennes where he was visited almost daily by Rousseau at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.

Voltaire wrote an enthusiastic letter to Diderot commending the Lettre and stating that he had held Diderot in high regard for a long time to which Diderot had sent a warm response. Soon after this Diderot was arrested.

Science historian Conway Zirkle has written that Diderot was an early evolutionary thinker and noted that his passage that described natural selection was so clear and accurate that it almost seems that we would be forced to accept his conclusions as a logical necessity even in the absence of the evidence collected since his time.

Angered by public resentment over the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle the government started incarcerating many of its critics. It was decided at this time to rein in Diderot. On 23 July 1749 the governor of the Vincennes fortress instructed the police to incarcerate Diderot and the next day he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the Vincennes. It is during this time that Jean-Jacques Rousseau came to visit Diderot in prison and came out a changed man with newfound ideas about the downsides of knowledge civilization and Enlightenment the so-called illumination de Vincennes.

Diderot had been permitted to retain one book that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest Paradise Lost which he read during his incarceration. He wrote notes and annotations on the book using a toothpick as a pen and ink that he made by scraping slate from the walls and mixing it with wine.

In August 1749 Mme du Chatelet presumably at Voltaires behest wrote to the governor of Vincennes who was her relative pleading that Diderot be lodged more comfortably while jailed. The governor then offered Diderot access to the great halls of the Vincennes castle and the freedom to receive books and visitors providing he would write a document of submission. On 13 August 1749 Diderot wrote to the governor

I admit to you...that the Pensées the Bijoux and the Lettre sur les aveugles are debaucheries of the mind that escaped from me; but I can...promise you on my honor that they will be the last and that they are the only ones...As for those who have taken part in the publication of these works nothing will be hidden from you. I shall depose verbally in the depths of your heart the names both of the publishers and the printers.

On 20 August Diderot was lodged in a comfortable room in the Vincennes allowed to meet visitors and to walk in the gardens of the Vincennes. On 23 August Diderot signed another letter promising to never leave the Vincennes without permission. On 3 November 1749 Diderot was released from the Vincennes. Subsequently in 1750 he released the prospectus for the Encyclopédie.

André le Breton a bookseller and printer approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of Ephraim Chambers Cyclopaedia or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences into French first undertaken by the Englishman John Mills and followed by the German Gottfried Sellius. Diderot accepted the proposal and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the Republic of Letters. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. Jean le Rond dAlembert was persuaded to become Diderots colleague and permission was procured from the government.

In 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the project and in 1751 the first volume was published. This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies but each and every branch of human knowledge. Comprehensive knowledge will give the power to change mens common way of thinking. The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.

Diderots work however was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed accusations arose regarding seditious content concerning the editors entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles but the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They were hidden in the house of an unlikely confederateChretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes who originally ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist and loyal to the monarchyhe was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support and that of other well-placed influential confederates the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.

These twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the Encyclopédie in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure it no longerthe subscribers had grown from 2000 to 4000 a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power. Diderot wanted the Encyclopédie to give all the knowledge of the world to the people of France. However the Encyclopédie threatened the governing social classes of France because it took for granted the justice of religious tolerance freedom of thought and the value of science and industry. It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nations government ought to be the nations common people. It was believed that the Encyclopédie was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759 the Encyclopédie was formally suppressed. The decree did not stop the work which went on but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. Jean le Rond dAlembert withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues including Anne Robert Jacques Turgot Baron de Laune declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired a bad reputation.

Diderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote about 7000 articles some very slight but many of them laborious comprehensive and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less competent contributors. He spent his days at workshops mastering manufacturing processes and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765.

In 1764 when his immense work was drawing to an end he encountered a crowning mortification he discovered that the bookseller Le Breton fearing the governments displeasure had struck out from the proof sheets after they had left Diderots hands all passages that he considered too dangerous. He and his printing-house overseer writes Furbank had worked in complete secrecy and had moreover deliberately destroyed the authors original manuscript so that the damage could not be repaired. The monument to which Diderot had given the labor of twenty long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced. It was 12 years in 1772 before the subscribers received the final 28 folio volumes of the Encyclopédie ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences des arts et des métiers since the first volume had been published.

When Diderots work on the Encyclopédie project came to an end in 1765 he expressed concerns to his friends that the twenty-five years he had spent on the project had been wasted.

Although the Encyclopédie was Diderots most monumental product he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every intellectual field with new and creative ideas. Diderots writing ranges from a graceful trifle like the Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre up to the heady DAlemberts Dream a philosophical dialogue in which he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of matter and the meaning of life.Jacques le fataliste is similar to Tristram Shandy and The Sentimental Journey in its challenge to the conventional novels structure and content.

La Religieuse was a novel that claimed to show the corruption of the Catholic Churchs institutions.

The novel began not as a work for literary consumption but as an elaborate practical joke aimed at luring the Marquis de Croismare a companion of Diderots back to Paris. The Nun is set in the 18th century that is contemporary France. Suzanne Simonin is an intelligent and sensitive sixteen-year-old French girl who is forced against her will into a Catholic convent by her parents. Suzannes parents initially inform her that she is being sent to the convent for financial reasons. However while in the convent she learns that she is actually there because she is an illegitimate child as her mother committed adultery. By sending Suzanne to the convent her mother thought she could make amends for her sins by using her daughter as a sacrificial offering.

At the convent Suzanne suffers humiliation harassment and violence because she refuses to make the vows of the religious community. She eventually finds companionship with the Mother Superior Sister de Moni who pities Suzannes anguish. After Sister de Monis death the new Mother Superior Sister Sainte-Christine does not share the same empathy for Suzanne that her predecessor had blaming Suzanne for the death of Sister de Moni. Suzanne is physically and mentally harassed by Sister Sainte-Christine almost to the point of death.

Suzanne contacts her lawyer Monsieur Manouri who attempts to legally free her from her vows. Manouri manages to have Suzanne transferred to another convent Sainte-Eutrope. At the new convent the Mother Superior is revealed to be a lesbian and she grows affectionate towards Suzanne. The Mother Superior attempts to seduce Suzanne but her innocence and chastity eventually drives the Mother Superior to insanity leading to her death.

Suzanne escapes the Sainte-Eutrope convent using the help of a priest. Following her liberation she lives in fear of being captured and taken back to the convent as she awaits the help from Diderots friend the Marquis de Croismare.

Diderot did not use the novel as an outlet to condemn Christianity but as a way to criticize cloistered life. In Diderots telling the Church fostered a hierarchical society prevalent in the power dynamic between the Mother Superior and the girls in the convent. Girls were forced against their will to take their vows and endure the intolerable life of the convent. Diderot highlighted the victimization of women by the Catholic Church. Their subjection to the convent dehumanized them and represses their sexuality. Furthermore the novel took place during a time in France when religious vows were regulated and enforced by the government. Through his cross-identification writing style Diderot manifested the demeaning Catholic standards towards women that forced them to obey their determined fate under the hierarchical society.

Although The Nun was completed in about 1780 the work was not published until 1796 after Diderots death.

The dialogue Rameaus Nephew is a farce-tragedy reminiscent of the Satires of Horace a favorite classical author of Diderots whose lines Vertumnis quotquot sunt natus iniquis the unfavorable Vertumnuses however many they are appear as epigraph. According to Nicholas Cronk Rameaus Nephew is arguably the greatest work of the French Enlightenments greatest writer.

The narrator in the book recounts a conversation with Jean-François Rameau nephew of the famous Jean-Philippe Rameau. The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but feels disadvantaged by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wifes death he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot a man who was once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife who is now living in poverty and decadence shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothingnot in religion nor in morality; nor in the Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another. He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system. The wise man according to the nephew will consequently practice hedonism

Hurrah for wisdom and philosophythe wisdom of Solomon to drink good wines gorge on choice foods tumble pretty women sleep on downy beds; outside of that all is vanity.

The dialogue ends with Diderot calling the nephew a wastrel a coward and a glutton devoid of spiritual values to which the nephew replies I believe you are right.

Diderots intention in writing the dialoguewhether as a satire on contemporary manners a reduction of the theory of self-interest to an absurdity the application of irony to the ethics of ordinary convention a mere setting for a discussion about music or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human originalis disputed. In political terms it explores the bipolarisation of the social classes under absolute monarchy and insofar as its protagonist demonstrates how the servant often manipulates the master Le Neveu de Rameau can be seen to anticipate Hegels masterslave dialectic.

The publication history of the Nephew is circuitous. Written between 1761 and 1774 Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime and apparently did not even share it with his friends. After Diderots death a copy of the text reached Schiller who gave it to Goethe who in 1805 translated the work into German. Goethes translation entered France and was retranslated into French in 1821. Another copy of the text was published in 1823 but it had been expurgated by Diderots daughter prior to publication. The original manuscript was only found in 1891.

Diderots most intimate friend was the philologist Friedrich Melchior Grimm. They were brought together by their common friend at that time Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1753 Grimm began writing a newsletter the La Correspondance littéraire philosophique et critique which he would send to various high personages in Europe.

In 1759 Grimm asked Diderot to report on the biennial art exhibitions in the Louvre for the Correspondance. Diderot reported on the Salons between 1759 and 1771 and again in 1775 and 1781. Diderots reports would become the most celebrated contributions to La Correspondance.

According to Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve Diderots reports initiated the French into a new way of laughing and introduced people to the mystery and purport of colour by ideas. Before Diderot Anne Louise Germaine de Staël wrote I had never seen anything in pictures except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave them relief and life and it is almost a new sense for which I am indebted to his genius.

Diderot had appended an Essai sur la peinture to his report on the 1765 Salon in which he expressed his views on artistic beauty. Goethe described the Essai sur la peinture as a magnificent work; it speaks even more usefully to the poet than to the painter though for the painter too it is a torch of blazing illumination.

Jean-Baptiste Greuze was Diderots favorite contemporary artist. Diderot appreciated Greuzes sentimentality and more particularly Greuzes portrayals of his wife who had once been Diderots mistress.

Diderot wrote sentimental plays Le Fils naturel and Le Père de famille accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice including Les Entretiens sur Le Fils Naturel in which he announced the principles of a new drama the serious genre a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage. In 1758 Diderot introduced the concept of the fourth wall the imaginary wall at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled box set in a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play. He also wrote Paradoxe sur le comédien written between 1770 and 1778 but first published after his death in 1830 which is a dramatic essay elucidating a theory of acting in which it is argued that great actors do not experience the emotions they are displaying. That essay is also of note for being where the term lesprit de lescalier comes from. It is a French term used in English for the predicament of thinking of the perfect reply too late.

When the Russian Empress Catherine the Great heard that Diderot was in need of money she arranged to buy his library and appoint him caretaker of it until his death at a salary of 1000 livres per year. She even paid him 50 years salary in advance. Although Diderot hated traveling he was obliged to visit her.

On 9 October 1773 he reached St. Petersburg met Catherine the next day and they had several discussions on various subjects. During his five-month stay at her court he met her almost every day. During these conversations he would later state they spoke man to man.

He would occasionally make his point by slapping her thighs. In a letter to Madame Geoffrin Catherine wrote

Your Diderot is an extraordinary man. I emerge from interviews with him with my thighs bruised and quite black. I have been obliged to put a table between us to protect myself and my members.

One of the topics discussed was Diderots ideas about how to transform Russia into a utopia. In a letter to Comte de Ségur the Empress wrote that if she followed Diderots advice chaos would ensue in her kingdom.

When returning Diderot asked the Empress for 1500 rubles as reimbursement for his trip. She gave him 3000 rubles an expensive ring and an officer to escort him back to Paris. He wrote a eulogy in her honor upon reaching Paris.

In 1766 when Catherine heard that Diderot had not received his annual fee for editing the Encyclopédie she arranged for him to receive a massive sum of 50000 livres as an advance for his services as her librarian.

In July 1784 upon hearing that Diderot was in poor health Catherine arranged for him to move into a luxurious suite in the Rue de Richelieu. Diderot died two weeks after moving thereon 31 July 1784.

Among Diderots last works were notes On the Instructions of her Imperial Majesty...for the Drawing up of Laws. This commentary on Russia included replies to some arguments Catherine had made in the Nakaz. Diderot wrote that Catherine was certainly despotic due to circumstances and training but was not inherently tyrannical. Thus if she wished to destroy despotism in Russia she should abdicate her throne and destroy anyone who tries to revive the monarchy. She should publicly declare that there is no true sovereign other than the nation and there can be no true legislator other than the people. She should create a new Russian legal code establishing an independent legal framework and starting with the text We the people and we the sovereign of this people swear conjointly these laws by which we are judged equally. In the Nakaz Catherine had written It is for legislation to follow the spirit of the nation. Diderots rebuttal stated that it is for legislation to make the spirit of the nation. For instance he argued it is not appropriate to make public executions unnecessarily horrific.

Ultimately Diderot decided not to send these notes to Catherine; however they were delivered to her with his other papers after he died. When she read them she was furious and commented that they were an incoherent gibberish devoid of prudence insight and verisimilitude.

In his youth Diderot was originally a follower of Voltaire and his deist Anglomanie but gradually moved away from this line of thought towards materialism and atheism a move which was finally realised in 1747 in the philosophical debate in the second part of his The Skeptics Walk . Diderot opposed mysticism and occultism which were highly prevalent in France at the time he wrote and believed religious truth claims must fall under the domain of reason not mystical experience or esoteric secrets. However Diderot showed some interest in the work of Paracelsus. He was a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another .

What I like is a philosophy clear definite and frank such as you have in the System of Nature. The author is not an atheist on one page and a deist on another. His philosophy is all of one piece.

In conceiving the Encyclopédie Diderot had thought of the work as a fight on behalf of posterity and had expressed confidence that posterity would be grateful for his effort. According to Diderot posterity is for the philosopher what the other world is for the man of religion.

According to Andrew S. Curran the main questions of Diderots thought are the following

Diderot died of pulmonary thrombosis in Paris on 31 July 1784 and was buried in the citys Église Saint-Roch. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II who had it deposited at the National Library of Russia. He has several times been denied burial in the Panthéon with other French notables.

Diderots remains were unearthed by grave robbers in 1793 leaving his corpse on the churchs floor. His remains were then presumably transferred to a mass grave by the authorities.

The French government considered memorializing him on the 300th anniversary of his birth but this did not come to pass.

Marmontel and Henri Meister commented on the great pleasure of having intellectual conversations with Diderot.Morellet a regular attendee at DHolbachs salon wrote It is there that I heard...Diderot treat questions of philosophy art or literature and by his wealth of expression fluency and inspired appearance hold our attention for a long stretch of time. Diderots contemporary and rival Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote in his Confessions that after a few centuries Diderot would be accorded as much respect by posterity as was given to Plato and Aristotle. In Germany Goethe Schiller and Lessing expressed admiration for Diderots writings Goethe pronouncing Diderots Rameaus Nephew to be the classical work of an outstanding man and that Diderot is Diderot a unique individual; whoever carps at him and his affairs is a philistine.

As atheism fell out of favor during the French Revolution Diderot was vilified and considered responsible for the excessive persecution of the clergy.

In the next century Diderot was admired by Balzac Delacroix Stendhal Zola and Schopenhauer. According to Comte Diderot was the foremost intellectual in an exciting age. Historian Michelet described him as the true Prometheus and stated that Diderots ideas would continue to remain influential long into the future. Marx chose Diderot as his favourite prose-writer.

Otis Fellows and Norman Torrey have described Diderot as the most interesting and provocative figure of the French eighteenth century.

In 1993 American writer Cathleen Schine published Rameaus Niece a satire of academic life in New York that took as its premise a womans research into an 18th-century pornographic parody of Diderots Rameaus Nephew. The book was praised by Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times as a nimble philosophical satire of the academic mind and an enchanting comedy of modern manners.

French author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt wrote a play titled Le Libertin which imagines a day in Diderots life including a fictional sitting for a woman painter which becomes sexually charged but is interrupted by the demands of editing the Encyclopédie. It was first staged at Paris Théâtre Montparnasse in 1997 starring Bernard Giraudeau as Diderot and Christiane Cohendy as Madame Therbouche and was well received by critics.

In 2013 the tricentennial of Diderots birth his hometown of Langres held a series of events in his honor and produced an audio tour of the town highlighting places that were part of Diderots past including the remains of the convent where his sister Angélique took her vows. On 6 October 2013 a museum of the Enlightenment focusing on Diderots contributions to the movement the Maison des Lumières Denis Diderot was inaugurated in Langres.

Catherine You have a hot head and I have one too. We interrupt each other we do not hear what the other one says and so we say stupid things.

Diderot With this difference that when I interrupt your Majesty I commit a great impertinence.

Catherine No between men there is no such thing as impertinence."
Georges Didi-Huberman,"Georges Didi-Huberman FBA is a French philosopher and art historian.

In July 2017 Didi-Huberman was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy the United Kingdoms national academy for the humanities and social sciences."
Jean Domat,"Jean Domat or Daumat was a French jurist.

Domat was born at Clermont in Auvergne. He studied the humaniora in Paris where he befriended Blaise Pascal and later law at the University of Bourges. Domat closely sympathized with the Port-Royalists and on Pascals death he was entrusted with the latters private papers. After Domats promotion in 1645 he practised law in Clermont and was appointed a crown prosecutor there in 1655. In 1683 he retired from this office with a pension from Louis XIV to concentrate on his scholarship.

Together with Antoine Dadin de Hauteserre Antoine Favre and the Godefroy brothers Domat was one of the few later French scholars of Roman law of international significance. He is principally known from his elaborate legal digest in three quarto volumes under the title of Lois civiles dans leur ordre naturel an undertaking for which Louis XIV settled on him a pension of 2000 livres. A fourth volume Le droit public was published in 1697 a year after his death. After Hugo Doneaus more thorough but less consistent Commentarii iuris civilis the work was the first of this type of pan-European significance. It was to become one of the principal sources of the ancien droit on which the Napoleonic Code was later founded.

Domats work was in line with earlier Humanist attempts to transform the seemingly random historical sources of law into a rational system of rules. However as a supporter of a Cartesian juridical order Domat endeavoured to found all law upon ethical or religious principles his motto being Lhomme est fait par Dieu et pour Dieu . The work was thus an attempt to establish a system of French law on the basis of moral principles and it presented the contents of the Corpus Juris Civilis in the form of a new system of natural law.

After the work of Robert Joseph Pothier Domats work is regarded as the second most important influence on the Civil Code of Lower Canada.

Besides the Lois civiles Domat prepared in Latin a selection of the laws in the Digesta and the Codex Justinianeus under the title Legum delectus ; it was subsequently appended to the Lois civiles. Domat died in Paris on 14 March 1696."

Joseph Droz,"François-Xavier-Joseph Droz was a reactionaryFrench writer on ethics political science and political economy.

He was born at Besançon where his family had supplied many notable members of the legal profession. Drozs own legal studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived the day after the dethronement of King Louis XVI of France and was present during the massacres of September. On the declaration of war he joined the volunteer battalion of the Doubs and for the next three years served in the Army of the Rhine.Discharged on health grounds he obtained a much more congenial post in the newly founded école centrale of Besançon; and in 1799 he made his first appearance as an author by an Essai sur lart oratoire in which he acknowledges his indebtedness more especially to Hugh Blair.

Moving to Paris in 1803 he became friendly not only with the like-minded Ducis but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on this philosophers advice that in order to catch the public ear he produced the romance of Lina which Sainte-Beuve has characterized as a mingled echo of Florian and Werther.

Like several other literary men of the time he obtained a post in the revenue office known as the Droits runis; but from 1814 he devoted himself exclusively to literature and became a contributor to various journals. Already favorably known by his Essai sur lart dêtre heureux his Éloge de Montaigne and his Essai sur le beau dans les arts he not only gained the Montyon Prize in 1823 by his work De la philosophie morale ou des différents systèmes sur la science de la vie but also in 1824 obtained admission to the Académie française.

The main doctrine that this treatise seeks to inculcate is that society will never be in a proper state until men have been educated to think of their duties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by Application de la morale à la politique and in 1829 by Léconomie politique ou principes de la science des richesses a methodical and clearly written treatise which was edited by Michel Chevalier in 1854. His next and greatest work was a Histoire du règne de Louis XVI in three volumes . As he advanced in life Droz became more and more decidedly religious and the last work of his prolific pen was Pensées sur le christianisme . In the words of Sainte-Beuve he was born and he remained all his life of the race of the good and the just.

Joseph Droz is quoted by Peter Kropotkin in his history of the French Revolution when people were allowed to tour the oubliettes of the royalty and according to Joseph Droz people were horrified at what they saw and that even given this that in the Bastille there were even worse things to be seen."

Dany-Robert Dufour,"Dany-Robert Dufour is a French philosopher professor of educational sciences at the university Paris-VIII. He teaches regularly abroad particularly in Latin America.His main focus is symbolic processes with relevance to language philosophy political philosophy and psychoanalysis. He is a frequent participant in cooperative artistic activities with music literature or theatre.

In his books a large portion is dedicated to neoteny and the human physical inability of becoming full-grown. This has forced humans to invent culture.This condition may be weakness as well as greatness of man.

Culture is created by intersubjectivity where an I is talking to a you about an it. The it in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their neotenian state. This abstract leader he calls The Grand Subject and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages spirits machinery of gods the monotheistic almighty God the Proletariate the Race and lately the neoliberal Market.

In the book Lart de réduire les têtes Dufour considers the postmodern change which Lyotard refers to as the end of the Grand Narrative.

This new aspect suits liberalism in an excellent way being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise he claims.

In the book Le Divin Marché la révolution culturelle libérale Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion the Divine Market functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which Bernard Mandeville described in The Fable of the Bees in 1704 it is the vices which alone by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living stimulate society into action and progress. This miracle is produced by divine providence what Adam Smith was to call The Invisible Hand.

Dufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of school in Antiquity Greek σχολή Latin otium free time i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual before entering business life to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions neither his own nor those of others.

We are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education the classical one with self-control and the liberal one where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude according to Dufour. This world however creates a new problem when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.

More generally this book describes and analyses one year before the big Financial crisis of 200708 the potentially destructive effects of liberalism not only on the market economy but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as politics use of symbols semiotics psychology... And not to disregard what contains everything how to handle ones own living.

In La cité perverse libéralisme et pornographie 2009 Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of todays society.

We live in a world that has made egoism its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct whether in the uppermost classes among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of being together or being your-self it urges us to live in a perverted society pornography selfishness contestation of every law whatsoever acceptance of social darwinism. It makes the Other a tool and results in our world becoming de Sade-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between Adam Smith and Marquis de Sade. 

Against the old moral order which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now on the contrary fashionable to display ones passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses todays world as a result of the revolution of western metaphysics during the century between Pascals puritan philosophy and de Sades porno fixated one .

Lindividu qui vient après le libéralisme published in 2011 is a new step in Dufours work. He considers that he has sufficiently deconstructed the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible axioms for a real civilizational policy.

He first states that western civilization after a century of two forceful turbulences nazism and stalinism now is drawn into todays neoliberalism. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension the nature of which is political economical ecological moral subjective esthetical intellectual 

Dufour however sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest totalitarianism which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.

Dufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called le divin Marché . Like all religions a promise makes it function salvation by continual growth of riches a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its renaissance.

For this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing The Divine Market.He proposes to go back to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and his public Oration on the Dignity of Man which has been called the Manifesto of the Renaissance.

What it is all about is the perspective of a new Renaissance new dynamics like those during the Quattrocento when knowledge was attained how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and supported by this how to overcome the grip of obscure tenets dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by herhimself while giving the same right to the Other. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law . An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny of mass consumption.

In Le délire occidental Dufour starts from what Descartes argued in his Discourse on the Method humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.

If this occidental madness today causes problems it is because it has become worldwide the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything including people and environment. A madness which like all forms of madness is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life which are work leisure and love by voiding them of all substance.

This is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. Yet all is not lost a new reason free from this madness is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.

In his book La situation désespéré du présent me remplit despoir 2016 Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the Occidental madness founded on the will to always have more has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of fundamentalist expression like for instance jihadism where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of infidels. This second madness leads in turn to a third madness that of madness of identity which can cause civil wars in the search for alien elements to exterminate.

That is why the present day philosophical question according to Dany-Robert Dufour is about how to get out of these impasses."

Durandus of Saint-Pourçain,"He was born at Saint-Pourçain Auvergne. Little is known of Durandus of Saint-Pourçain prior to 1307 but some small facts. His preliminary work was prepared in some Dominican studium. He entered the Dominican Order at Clermont and studied at the University of Paris to which he obtained his doctoral degree in 1313. Clement V called him to be Master of the Sacred Palace.

He lectured on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. He was at this time submitting ideas that were not exactly parallel to those of Thomas Aquinas. This was the production of the first extensive commentary on the Sentences published in 13038 . After review of the first commentary it seemed very improbable that Durandus could have been a follower of Aquinas prior to 1307.

Since Thomas Aquinas was held at a higher standing than any other doctor within the Dominican order they were to defend and uphold his ideas predominately. This caused Durand to be criticized from one of the leading Dominican followers of Aquinas Hervaeus Natalis. This was a doctoral quarrel and an illustration of the fourteenth-century doctoral tensions. It was at this time that Durandus of Saint-Pourçain set out to write his second commentary on the Sentences which he adhered more closely to Aquinass way.

This second version of the commentary was written around 13101312 . This did much to help respond to the criticisms that he had received previously but instead brought on more criticism and grief. Additionally his scholarly efforts and the receipt of his doctrine in theology from the University of Paris in 1312 did not make much of a difference either leading to the Dominican order initiating two formal investigations. The first investigation was in 13121314 and the other in 131617.

Despite these conflicts Durandus was appointed to lecture at papal curia in Avignon. He was consecrated Bishop in three places; first of Limoux then of Le Puy-en-Velay in 1318 and was transferred to the diocese of Meaux in 1326 where he would later die. He was highly regarded by Pope John XXII and assigned by him to examine the orthodoxy of William Ockham in 132425. The pope also consulted him on difficult cases with many entrusted diplomatic missions attributed to him.

Meanwhile Durand wrote his last of the three commentaries the one for which he is most famous. In this final commentary Durand returned to several of his initial stances. He was not just famous for this controversial commentary and the earlier one but also for his surveying of Aquinas in the Dominican order and being influential throughout the early modern period. He became known as Doctor Resolutissimus owing to his strenuous advocacy of certain opinions novel to contemporary academics. Although Durandus faced many controversial issues both inside and outside his order centuries later he was commended for his work alongside Bonaventure.

His nominalism was so much opposed to the contemporary philosophical realism that the third period of Scholasticism is made to begin with him. He rejects both the sensible and the intelligible species introduced he says to explain sense-perception as also the active intellect. He denies the principle of individuation as distinct from the specific nature of the individual.

Durandus invented the notion of an intrinsically evil act which he explains in the context of the concept of fortification where it is intrinsically evil. In the ideas of fortification Durandus does indeed coincide with Thomas Aquinas and his natural-law argument but only in simple fortification.

In theology he argued for a separation of natural knowledge from that obtained through faith and revelation. Certain dogmas as that of the Trinity cannot be shown not to contain impossibilities but to believe them withal increases the merit of faith. Because the miracles of Christ do not prove His Divinity His acceptance by the faithful enhances the merit of believing. After all he says theology is not strictly a science since it rests on faith not on the first principles of knowledge. In theology it is sufficient to know the idea of him who being inspired cannot err. He teaches besides that all actions proceed from God Who gives the power to act but this is no immediate influx of the Creator upon the actions of the creature. The sacraments are only causes without which grace is not conferred. Marriage is not strictly a sacrament. He also insinuates that Christ could be present in the Eucharist with the substances of bread and wine remaining.

Throughout Durandus shows submission to the corrective prerogative of the Church the exercise of which was not unnecessary. By order of Pope John XXII the treatise De statu animarum was examined and was found to contain eleven errors."

His mother Eléanore Médélice was of Afro-Martinican and white Alsatian descent and worked as a shopkeeper. Frantz was the third of four sons in a family of eight children. Two of them died young including his sister Gabrielle with whom Frantz was very close. His family was socio-economically middle-class. They could afford the fees for the Lycée Schoelcher at the time the most prestigious high school in Martinique where Fanon came to admire one of the schools teachers poet and writer Aimé Césaire. Fanon left Martinique in 1943 when he was 18 years old in order to join the Free French forces.

After France fell to the Nazis in 1940 Vichy French naval troops were blockaded on Martinique. Forced to remain on the island French sailors took over the government from the Martiniquan people and established a collaborationist Vichy regime. In the face of economic distress and isolation under the blockade they instituted an oppressive regime; Fanon described them as taking off their masks and behaving like authentic racists. Residents made many complaints of harassment and sexual misconduct by the sailors. The abuse of the Martiniquan people by the French Navy influenced Fanon reinforcing his feelings of alienation and his disgust with colonial racism. At the age of seventeen Fanon fled the island as a dissident traveling to Dominica to join the Free French Forces. After three attempts he made it to Dominica but it was too late to enlist. After the pro-Vichy Robert regime was deposed in Martinique in June 1943 Fanon returned to Fort-de-France to join the newly created all black Fifth Infantry Battalion.

He enlisted in the Free French army and joined an Allied convoy that reached Casablanca. He was later transferred to an army base at Béjaïa on the Kabylie coast of Algeria. Fanon left Algeria from Oran and served in France notably in the battles of Alsace. In 1944 he was wounded at Colmar and received the Croix de guerre. When the Nazis were defeated and Allied forces crossed the Rhine into Germany along with photojournalists Fanons regiment was bleached of all non-white soldiers.

During the war Fanon was exposed to more white European racism. For example European women liberated by black soldiers often preferred to dance with fascist Italian prisoners rather than fraternize with their liberators.

In 1945 Fanon returned to Martinique. He lasted a short time there. He worked for the parliamentary campaign of his friend and mentor Aimé Césaire who would be a major influence in his life. Césaire ran on the communist ticket as a parliamentary delegate from Martinique to the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. Fanon stayed long enough to complete his baccalaureate and then went to France where he studied medicine and psychiatry.

Fanon was educated in Lyon where he also studied literature drama and philosophy sometimes attending Merleau-Pontys lectures. During this period he wrote three plays of which two survive. After qualifying as a psychiatrist in 1951 Fanon did a residency in psychiatry at Saint-Alban-sur-Limagnole under the radical Catalan psychiatrist François Tosquelles who invigorated Fanons thinking by emphasizing the role of culture in psychopathology.

In France while completing his residency Fanon wrote and published his first book Black Skin White Masks an analysis of the negative psychological effects of colonial subjugation upon black people. Originally the manuscript was the doctoral dissertation submitted at Lyon entitled Essay on the Disalienation of the Black which was a response to the racism that Fanon experienced while studying psychiatry and medicine at university in Lyon; the rejection of the dissertation prompted Fanon to publish it as a book. For his doctor of philosophy degree he submitted another dissertation of narrower scope and different subject. Left-wing philosopher Francis Jeanson leader of the pro-Algerian independence Jeanson network read Fanons manuscript and as a senior book editor at Éditions du Seuil in Paris gave the book its new title and wrote its epilogue.

After receiving Fanons manuscript at Seuil Jeanson invited him to an editorial meeting which revealed Fanons thin skin. Amid Jeansons praise of the book Fanon exclaimed Not bad for a nigger is it Insulted Jeanson dismissed Fanon from his office. Later Jeanson learned that his response had earned him the writers lifelong respect and Fanon acceded to Jeansons suggestion that the book be entited Black Skin White Masks.

In the book Fanon described the unfair treatment of black people in France and how they were disapproved of by white people. Black people also had a sense of inferiority when facing white people. Fanon believed that even though they could speak French they could not fully integrate into the life and environment of white people. 

After his residency Fanon practised psychiatry at Pontorson near Mont Saint-Michel for another year and then in Algeria. He was chef de service at the Blida-Joinville Psychiatric Hospital in Algeria. He worked there until his deportation in January 1957.

Fanons methods of treatment started evolving particularly by beginning socio-therapy to connect with his patients cultural backgrounds. He also trained nurses and interns. Following the outbreak of the Algerian revolution in November 1954 Fanon joined the Front de Libération Nationale after having made contact with Dr Pierre Chaulet at Blida in 1955. Working at a French hospital in Algeria Fanon became responsible for treating the psychological distress of the French soldiers and officers who carried out torture in order to suppress anti-colonial resistance. Additionally Fanon was also responsible for treating Algerian torture victims.

Fanon made extensive trips across Algeria mainly in the Kabyle region to study the cultural and psychological life of Algerians. His lost study of The marabout of Si Slimane is an example. These trips were also a means for clandestine activities notably in his visits to the ski resort of Chrea which hid an FLN base.

By summer 1956 Fanon realized that he could no longer continue to support French efforts even indirectly via his hospital work. In November he submitted his Letter of resignation to the Resident Minister which later became an influential text of its own in anti-colonialist circles.

There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty. The ruling intentions of personal existence are not in accord with the permanent assaults on the most commonplace values. For many months my conscience has been the seat of unpardonable debates. And the conclusion is the determination not to despair of man in other words of myself. The decision I have reached is that I cannot continue to bear a responsibility at no matter what cost on the false pretext that there is nothing else to be done.

Shortly afterwards Fanon was expelled from Algeria and moved to Tunis where he joined the FLN openly. He was part of the editorial collective of Al Moudjahid for which he wrote until the end of his life. He also served as Ambassador to Ghana for the Provisional Algerian Government . He attended conferences in Accra Conakry Addis Ababa Leopoldville Cairo and Tripoli. Many of his shorter writings from this period were collected posthumously in the book Toward the African Revolution. In this book Fanon reveals war tactical strategies; in one chapter he discusses how to open a southern front to the war and how to run the supply lines.

Upon his return to Tunis after his exhausting trip across the Sahara to open a Third Front Fanon was diagnosed with leukemia. He went to the Soviet Union for treatment and experienced some remission of his illness. When he came back to Tunis once again he dictated his testament The Wretched of the Earth. When he was not confined to his bed he delivered lectures to Armée de Libération Nationale officers at Ghardimao on the Algerian-Tunisian border. He traveled to Rome for a three-day meeting with Jean-Paul Sartre who had greatly influenced his work. Sartre agreed to write a preface to Fanons last book The Wretched of the Earth.

In 1961 the CIA arranged a trip to the U.S. for further leukemia treatment at a National Institutes of Health facility. During his time in the United States Fanon was handled by CIA agent Oliver Iselin.

Fanon died in Bethesda Maryland on 6 December 1961 under the name of Ibrahim Fanon a Libyan nom de guerre he had assumed in order to enter a hospital in Rome after being wounded in Morocco during a mission for the Algerian National Liberation Front. He was buried in Algeria after lying in state in Tunisia. Later his body was moved to a martyrs graveyard at Ain Kerma in eastern Algeria. 

Frantz Fanon was survived by his French wife Josie their son Olivier Fanon and his daughter from a previous relationship Mireille Fanon-Mendès France. Josie Fanon died by suicide in Algiers in 1989. Mireille became a professor of international law and conflict resolution and serves as president of the Frantz Fanon Foundation. Olivier became president of the Frantz Fanon National Association which was created in Algiers in 2012.

Black Skin White Masks was published in 1952 and is one of Fanons most important works. In Black Skin White Masks Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed Black person who is perceived to have to be a lesser creature in the White world that they live in and studies how they navigate the world through a performance of White-ness. Particularly in discussing language he talks about how the black persons use of a colonizers language is seen by the colonizer as predatory and not transformative which in turn may create insecurity in the blacks consciousness. He recounts that he himself faced many admonitions as a child for using Creole French instead of real French or French French that is white French. Ultimately he concludes that mastery of language for the sake of recognition as white reflects a dependency that subordinates the blacks humanity.

Chapter 1 of Black Skin White Masks is entitled The Negro and Language. In this chapter Fanon discusses how colored people were perceived by the whites. He says that the black man has two dimensions. One with his fellows the other with the white man. A Negro behaves differently with a white man than with another Negro. That this self-division is a direct result of colonialist subjugation is beyond question. To speak a language is to take on a world a culture. The Antilles Negro who wants to be white will be the whiter as he gains greater mastery of the cultural tool that language is. Fanon concludes this theorizing by saying Historically it must be understood that the Negro wants to speak French because it is the key that can open doors which were still barred to him fifty years ago. In the Antilles Negro who comes within this study we find a quest for subtleties for refinements of languageso many further means of proving to himself that he has measured up to the culture.

Chapter 5 of Black Skin White Masks is entitled The Fact of Blackness. In this chapter Fanon tackles many theories. One theory he addresses is the different schema that are said to exist within a person and how they exist differently for Black people. He talks about ones bodily schema and theorizes that because of both the historical-racial schema -- one that exists because of the history of racism and makes it so there is no one bodily-schema because of the context that comes with Blacknessand ones epidermal-racial schema -- where Black people cannot be seen for their single bodily-schema because they are seen to represent their race and the history and therefore cannot be seen past their fleshthere is no universal Black schema. He describes this experience as no longer a question of being aware of my body in the third person but in a triple person. Fanon concludes this theorizing by saying As long as the black man is among his own he will have no occasion except in minor internal conflicts to experience his being through others.

Fanon also addresses Ontology stating that it does not permit us to understand the being of the black man. He says that because Blackness was created in and continues to exist in negation to whiteness that ontology is not a philosophy that can be used to understand the Black experience. Fanon states that this ontology cant be used to understand the Black experience because it ignores the lived experience. He argues that a black man has to be black while also being black in relation to the white man.

Chapter 6 of Black Skin White Masks is entitled The Negro and Psychopathology. In this chapter Fanon discussed how being Black can and does affect ones psyche. He makes it clear that the treatment of Black people causes emotional trauma. Fanon argues that as a result of ones skin color being Black Black people are unable to truly process this trauma or make it unconscious . Black people are unable to not think about the fact that they are Black and all of the historical and current stigma that come with that. Fanons work in this chapter specifically shows the short-comings of major names in psychology such as Sigmund Freud. However Fanon repeatedly mentions the importance of Jacques Lacans theory of language. Fanon discusses the mental health of Black people to show that traditional psychology was created and founded without thinking about Black people and their experiences.

Although Fanon wrote Black Skin White Masks while still in France most of his work was written in North Africa. It was during this time that he produced works such as LAn Cinq de la Révolution Algérienne in 1959 later republished as Sociology of a Revolution and later still as A Dying Colonialism. Fanons original title was Reality of a Nation; however the publisher François Maspero refused to accept this title.

Fanon is best known for the classic analysis of colonialism and decolonization The Wretched of the Earth.The Wretched of the Earth was first published in 1961 by Éditions Maspero with a preface by Jean-Paul Sartre. In it Fanon analyzes the role of class race national culture and violence in the struggle for national liberation. The book includes an article which focuses on the ideas of violence and decolonization. He claims that decolonization is inherently a violent process because the relationship between the settler and the native is a binary of opposites. In fact he uses the Biblical metaphor The last shall be first and the first last to describe the moment of decolonization. The situation of settler colonialism creates within the native a tension which grows over time and in many ways is fostered by the settler. This tension is initially released among the natives but eventually it becomes a catalyst for violence against the settler. His work would become an academic and theoretical foundation for many revolutions.

Fanon uses the Jewish people to explain how the prejudice expressed towards blacks cannot not be generalized to other races or ethnicities. He discusses this in Black Skins White Masks and pulls from Jean-Paul Sartres Reflections on the Jewish Question to inform his understanding of French colonialism relationship with the Jewish people and how it can be compared and contrasted with the oppressions of Blacks across the world. In his seminal book Fanon issues many rebuttals to Octave Mannonis Prospero and Caliban The Psychology of Colonization. Mannoni asserts that colonial exploitation is not the same as other forms of exploitation and colonial racialism is different from other kinds of racialism. Fanon responds by arguing that racism or anti-Semitism colonial or otherwise are not different because they rip away a persons ability to feel human. He says I am deprived of the possibility of being a man. I cannot disassociate myself from the future that is proposed for my brother. Every one of my acts commits me as a man. Every one of my silences every one of my cowardices reveals me as a man. In this same vein Fanon echoes the philosophies of Maryse Choisy who believed that remaining neutral in times of great injustice implied an unforgivable complicity. Specifically Fanon mentions the ravages of racism and anti-Semitism because he believes that those who are one are necessarily the other as well. Yet he is careful to distinguish between the causes of the two. Fanon argues that the reasons for hating The Jew are born from a different fear than those for hating Blacks. Bigots are scared of Jews because they are threatened by what the Jew represents. The many tropes and stereotypes of Jewish cruelty laziness and cunning are the antithesis of the Western work ethic. The Black man is feared for perhaps similar traits but the impetus is different. Essentially The Jew is simply an idea but Blacks are feared for their physical attributes. Jewishness is not easily detectable to the naked eye but race is.

Both books established Fanon in the eyes of much of the Third World as the leading anti-colonial thinker of the 20th century.

Fanons three books were supplemented by numerous psychiatry articles as well as radical critiques of French colonialism in journals such as Esprit and El Moudjahid.

The reception of his work has been affected by English translations which are recognized to contain numerous omissions and errors while his unpublished work including his doctoral thesis has received little attention. As a result it has been argued Fanon has often been portrayed as an advocate of violence and that his ideas have been extremely oversimplified. This reductionist vision of Fanons work ignores the subtlety of his understanding of the colonial system. For example the fifth chapter of Black Skin White Masks translates literally as The Lived Experience of the Black but Markmanns translation is The Fact of Blackness which leaves out the massive influence of phenomenology on Fanons early work.

A Dying Colonialism is a 1959 book by Fanon that provides an account of how during the Algerian Revolution the people of Algeria changed centuries-old cultural patterns and embraced certain ancient cultural practices long derided by their colonialist oppressors as primitive in order to destroy those oppressors. Fanon uses the fifth year of the Algerian Revolution as a point of departure for an explication of the inevitable dynamics of colonial oppression. This is a strong lucid and militant book; to read it is to understand why Fanon says that for the colonized having a gun is the only chance you still have of giving a meaning to your death. One of the most influential articles Unveiled Algeria also comes from this book. It signifies the fall of imperialism and demonstrates how people struggle to decolonize their mind to avoid assimilation.

In The Wretched of the Earth published shortly before Fanons death Fanon defends the right of a colonized people to use violence to gain independence. In addition he delineated the processes and forces leading to national independence or neocolonialism during the decolonization movement that engulfed much of the world after World War II. In defence of the use of violence by colonized peoples Fanon argued that human beings who are not considered as such shall not be bound by principles that apply to humanity in their attitude towards the colonizer. His book was censored by the French government.

For Fanon in The Wretched of the Earth the colonizers presence in Algeria is based on sheer military strength. Any resistance to this strength must also be of a violent nature because it is the only language the colonizer speaks. Thus violent resistance is a necessity imposed by the colonists upon the colonized. The relevance of language and the reformation of discourse pervades much of his work which is why it is so interdisciplinary spanning psychiatric concerns to encompass politics sociology anthropology linguistics and literature.

His participation in the Algerian Front de Libération Nationale from 1955 determined his audience as the Algerian colonized. It was to them that his final work Les damnés de la terre was directed. It constitutes a warning to the oppressed of the dangers they face in the whirlwind of decolonization and the transition to a neo-colonialist globalized world.

An often overlooked aspect of Fanons work is that he did not like to physically write his pieces. Instead he would dictate to his wife Josie who did all of the writing and in some cases contributed and edited.

Fanon was influenced by a variety of thinkers and intellectual traditions including Jean-Paul Sartre Lacan Négritude and Marxism.

Aimé Césaire was a particularly significant influence in Fanons life. Césaire a leader of the Négritude movement was teacher and mentor to Fanon on the island of Martinique. Fanon was first introduced to Négritude during his lycée days in Martinique when Césaire coined the term and presented his ideas in Tropiques the journal that he edited with Suzanne Césaire his wife in addition to his now classic Cahier dun retour au pays natal . Fanon referred to Césaires writings in his own work. He quoted for example his teacher at length in The Lived Experience of the Black Man a heavily anthologized essay from Black Skins White Masks.

Fanon has had an influence on anti-colonial and national liberation movements. In particular Les damnés de la terre was a major influence on the work of revolutionary leaders such as Ali Shariati in Iran Steve Biko in South Africa Malcolm X in the United States and Ernesto Che Guevara in Cuba. Of these only Guevara was primarily concerned with Fanons theories on violence; for Shariati Biko and also Guevara the main interest in Fanon was the new man and black consciousness respectively.

With regard to the American liberation struggle more commonly known as The Black Power Movement Fanons work was especially influential. His book Wretched of the Earth is quoted directly in the preface of Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamiltons book Black Power The Politics of Liberation which was published in 1967 shortly after Carmichael left the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee . In addition Carmichael and Hamilton include much of Fanons theory on Colonialism in their work beginning by framing the situation of former slaves in America as a colony situated inside a nation. To put it another way there is no American dilemma because black people in this country form a colony and it is not in the interest of the colonial power to liberate them . Another example is the indictment of the black middle class or what Fanon called the colonized intellectual as the indoctrinated followers of the colonial power. Fanon states The native intellectual has clothed his aggressiveness in his barely veiled desire to assimilate himself to the colonial world . A third example is the idea that the natives should be constructing new social systems rather than participating in the systems created by the settler population. Ture and Hamilton contend that black people should create rather than imitate .

The Black Power group that Fanon had the most influence on was the Black Panther Party . In 1970 Bobby Seale the Chairman of the BPP published a collection of recorded observations made while he was incarcerated entitled Seize the Time The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton. This book while not an academic text is a primary source chronicling the history of the BPP through the eyes of one of its founders. While describing one of his first meetings with Huey P. Newton Seale describes bringing him a copy of Wretched of the Earth. There are at least three other direct references to the book all of them mentioning ways in which the book was influential and how it was included in the curriculum required of all new BPP members. Beyond just reading the text Seale and the BPP included much of the work in their party platform. The Panther 10 Point Plan contained 6 points which either directly or indirectly referenced ideas in Fanons work including their contention that there must be an end to the robbery by the white man and education that teaches us our true history and our role in present day society . One of the most important elements adopted by the BPP was the need to build the humanity of the native. Fanon claimed that the realization by the native that she was human would mark the beginning of the push for freedom . The BPP embraced this idea through the work of their Community Schools and Free Breakfast Programs.

Bolivian indianist Fausto Reinaga also had some Fanon influence and he mentions The Wretched of the Earth in his magnum opus La Revolución India advocating for decolonisation of native South Americans from European influence. In 2015 Raúl Zibechi argued that Fanon had become a key figure for the Latin American left. In August 2021 Fanons book Voices of liberation was one of those brought by Elisa Loncón to the new plurinational library of the Constitutional Convention of Chile.

Fanons influence extended to the liberation movements of the Palestinians the Tamils African Americans and others. His work was a key influence on the Black Panther Party particularly his ideas concerning nationalism violence and the lumpenproletariat. More recently radical South African poor peoples movements such as Abahlali baseMjondolo have been influenced by Fanons work. His work was a key influence on Brazilian educationist Paulo Freire as well.

Fanon has also profoundly affected contemporary African literature. His work serves as an important theoretical gloss for writers including Ghanas Ayi Kwei Armah Senegals Ken Bugul and Ousmane Sembène Zimbabwes Tsitsi Dangarembga and Kenyas Ngũgĩ wa Thiongo. Ngũgĩ goes so far to argue in Decolonizing the Mind that it is impossible to understand what informs African writing without reading Fanons Wretched of the Earth.

The Caribbean Philosophical Association offers the Frantz Fanon Prize for work that furthers the decolonization and liberation of mankind.

Fanons writings on black sexuality in Black Skin White Masks have garnered critical attention by a number of academics and queer theory scholars. Interrogating Fanons perspective on the nature of black homosexuality and masculinity queer theory academics have offered a variety of critical responses to Fanons words balancing his position within postcolonial studies with his influence on the formation of contemporary black queer theory.

Fanons legacy has expanded even further into Black Studies and more specifically into the theories of Afro-pessimism and Black Critical Theory. Thinkers such as Sylvia Wynter David Marriott Frank B. Wilderson III Jared Sexton Calvin Warren Patrice Douglass Zakkiyah Iman Jackson Axelle Karera and Selamawit Terrefe have taken up Fanons ontological phenomenological and psychoanalytic analyses of the Negro and the zone of non-being in order to develop theories of anti-Blackness. Putting Fanon in conversation with prominent thinkers like Sylvia Wynter Saidiya Hartman and Hortense Spillers and focusing primarily on the Charles Lam Markmann translation of Black Skin White Masks Black Critical Theorists and Afropessimists take seriously the ontological implications of the Fact of Blackness and The Negro and Psychopathology formulating the Black or the Slave as the non-relational phobic object that constitutes civil society."

François Fénelon,"François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon more commonly known as François Fénelon was a French Catholic archbishop theologian poet and writer. Today he is remembered mostly as the author of The Adventures of Telemachus first published in 1699.

Fénelon was born on 6 August 1651 at the Château de Fénelon in Sainte-Mondane Périgord Aquitaine in the Dordogne river valley the second of the three children of Pons de Salignac Comte de La Mothe-Fénelon by his wife Louise de La Cropte. Reduced to the status of impecunious old nobility by François time the La Mothe-Fénelons had produced leaders in both Church and state. His uncle Francois currently served as bishop of nearby Sarlat a see in which fifteen generations of the Fénelon family had filled the episcopal chair. In fact so many members of the family occupied the position that it had begun to be considered as practically a familial apanage to which the Salignac-Fénelon had a right as seigneurs of the locality 

Fénelons early education was provided in the Château de Fénelon by private tutors who gave him a thorough grounding in the language and literature of the Greek and Latin classics. In 1663 at age 12 he was sent to the University of Cahors where he studied rhetoric and philosophy under the influence of the Jesuit ratio studiorum. When the young man expressed interest in a career in the church his uncle the Marquis Antoine de Fénelon arranged for him to study at the Collège du Plessis in Paris whose theology students followed the same curriculum as the theology students at the Sorbonne. While there he became friends with Antoine de Noailles who later became a cardinal and the Archbishop of Paris. Fénelon demonstrated so much talent at the Collège du Plessis that at age 15 he was asked to give a public sermon.

About 1672 Fénelons uncle managed to get him enrolled in the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice the Sulpician seminary in Paris.

In about 1675 Fénelon was ordained as a priest. He initially dreamed of becoming a missionary to the East but instead and at the instigation of friends he preached in Sulpician parishes and performed routine pastoral work as his reputation for eloquence began to grow.

In early 1679 François Harlay de Champvallon Archbishop of Paris selected Fénelon as director of Nouvelles-Catholiques a community in Paris for young Huguenot girls who had been removed from their families and were about to join the Church of Rome. In 1681 he published a pedagogical work Traité de léducation des filles which brought him much attention not only in France but abroad as well.

From 1681 to 1695 Fénelon was prior of the fortified monastery at Carennac.

During this period Fénelon had become friends with his future rival Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. When Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685 the Church began a campaign to send the greatest orators in the country into the regions of France with the highest concentration of Huguenots to persuade them of the errors of Protestantism. Upon Bossuets suggestion Fénelon was included in this group alongside such oratorical greats as Louis Bourdaloue and Esprit Fléchier.

He spent the next three years in the Saintonge region of France preaching to Protestants. He persuaded the king to remove troops from the region and tried to avoid outright displays of religious oppression. But in the end he was willing to resort to force to make Protestants listen to his message. He believed that to be obliged to do good is always an advantage and that heretics and schismatics when forced to apply their minds to the consideration of truth eventually lay aside their erroneous beliefs whereas they would never have examined these matters had not authority constrained them.

During this period Fénelon assisted Bossuet during his lectures on the Bible at Versailles. It was probably at Bossuets urging that he now composed his Réfutation du système de Malebranche sur la nature et sur la grâce a work in which he attacked Nicolas Malebranches views on optimism the creation and the Incarnation. This work was not published until 1820 long after Fénelons death.

Fénelon also became friendly with the Duc de Beauvilliers and the Duc de Chevreuse who were married to the daughters of Louis XIVs minister of finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert. He wrote a Treatise on the Existence of God.

In 1688 Fénelon first met his cousin Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon usually known simply as Madame Guyon. At that time she was well received in the social circle of the Beauvilliers and Chevreuses. Fénelon was deeply impressed by her piety and actively discipled her. He would later become a devotee and defend her brand of Quietism.

In 1689 Louis XIV named Fénelons friend the Duc de Beauvilliers as governor of the royal grandchildren. Upon Beauvilliers recommendation Fénelon was named the tutor of the Dauphins eldest son the 7-year-old Duke of Burgundy who was second in line for the throne. This brought him a good deal of influence at court.

As tutor Fénelon was charged with guiding the character formation of a future King of France. He wrote several important works specifically to guide his young charge. These include his Fables and his Dialogues des Morts.

But by far the most lasting of his works that Fénelon composed for the duke was his Les Aventures de Télémaque written in 169394. On its surface The Adventures of Telemachus was a novel about Ulysses son Telemachus. On another level it became a biting attack on the divine right absolute monarchy which was the dominant ideology of Louis XIVs France. In sharp contrast to Bossuet who when tutor to the Dauphin had written Politique tirée de lÉcriture sainte which affirmed the divine foundations of absolute monarchy while also exhorting the future king to use restraint and wisdom in exercising his absolute power Fénelon went so far as to write Good kings are rare and the generality of monarchs bad.

French literary historian Jean-Claude Bonnet calls Télémaque the true key to the museum of the eighteenth-century imagination. One of the most popular works of the century it became an immediate best seller both in France and abroad going through many editions and translated into every European language and even Latin verse . It inspired numerous imitations such as the Abbé Jean Terrassons novel Life of Sethos which in turn inspired Mozarts Magic Flute. It also more directly supplied the plot for Mozarts opera Idomeneo . Scenes from Télémaque appeared in wallpaper. The American president Andrew Jackson wallpapered the entrance hall to his slave plantation The Hermitage in Tennessee with scenes from Telemachus on the Island of Calypso.

Most believed Fénelons tutorship resulted in a dramatic improvement in the young dukes behaviour. Even the memoirist Louis de Rouvroy duc de Saint-Simon who generally disliked Fénelon admitted that when Fénelon became tutor the duke was a spoiled violent child; when Fénelon left him the duke had learned the lessons of self-control as well as being thoroughly impressed with a sense of his future duties. Telemachus is therefore widely seen as the most thorough exposition of the brand of reformism in the Beauvilliers-Chevreuse circle which hoped that following Louis XIVs death his brand of autocracy could be replaced by a monarchy less centralized and less absolute and with a greater role for aristocrats such as Beauvilliers and Chevreuse.

In 1693 Fénelon was elected to Seat 34 of the Académie française.

In 1694 the king named Fénelon Abbot of Saint-Valery a lucrative post worth 14000 livres a year.

The early- to mid-1690s are significant since it was during this period that Mme de Maintenon began to regularly consult Fénelon on matters of conscience. Also since Fénelon had a reputation as an expert on educating girls she sought his advice on the house of Saint-Cyr which she was founding for girls.

In February 1696 the king nominated Fénelon to become the Archbishop of Cambrai while at the same time asking him to remain in his position as tutor to the duke of Burgundy. Fénelon accepted and he was consecrated by his old friend Bossuet in August.

As already noted Fénelon had met Madam Guyon in 1688 and became an admirer of her work.

In 1697 following a visit by Mme Guyon to Mme de Maintenons school at Saint-Cyr Paul Godet des Marais Bishop of Chartres expressed concerns about Mme Guyons orthodoxy to Mme de Maintenon. The bishop noted that Mme Guyons opinions bore striking similarities to Miguel de Molinos Quietism which Pope Innocent XI condemned in 1687. Mme de Maintenon responded by requesting an ecclesiastical commission to examine Mme Guyons orthodoxy the commission consisted of two of Fénelons old friends Bossuet and de Noailles as well as the head of the Sulpician order of which Fénelon was a member. The commission sat at Issy and after six months of deliberations delivered its opinion in the Articles dIssy 34 articles which briefly condemned certain of Mme Guyons opinions as well as set forth a brief exposition of the Catholic view of prayer. Both Fénelon and the Bishop of Chartres signed the articles as did all three commission members. Mme Guyon immediately submitted to the decision.

At Issy the commission asked Bossuet to follow up the Articles with an exposition. Bossuet thus proceeded to write Instructions sur les états doraison which he submitted to the commission members as well as to the Bishop of Chartres and Fénelon requesting their signatures before its publication. Fénelon refused to sign arguing that Mme Guyon had already admitted her mistakes and there was no point in further condemning her. Furthermore Fénelon disagreed with Bossuets interpretation of the Articles dIssy as he wrote in Explication des Maximes des Saints . Fénelon interpreted the Articles dIssy in a way much more sympathetic to the Quietist viewpoint than Bossuet proposed.

Louis XIV responded to the controversy by chastising Bossuet for not warning him earlier of Fénelons opinions and ordered Bossuet de Noailles and the Bishop of Chartres to respond to the Maximes des Saints. Shocked that his grandsons tutors held such views the king removed Fénelon from his post as royal tutor and ordered Fénelon to remain within the boundaries of the archdiocese of Cambrai.

This unleashed two years of pamphlet warfare as the two sides traded opinions. On 12 March 1699 the Inquisition formally condemned the Maximes des Saints with Pope Innocent XII listing 23 specific propositions as unorthodox.

Fénelon immediately declared that he submitted to the popes authority and set aside his own opinion. With this the Quietist matter was dropped.

However that same year The Adventures of Telemachus was published. This book also enraged Louis XIV for it appeared to question his regimes very foundations. Thus even after Fénelon abjured his Quietist views the king refused to revoke his order forbidding Fénelon from leaving his archdiocese.

As Archbishop of Cambrai Fénelon spent most of his time in the archiepiscopal palace but also spent several months of each year visiting churches and other institutions within his archdiocese. He preached in his cathedral on festival days and took an especial interest in seminary training and in examining candidates for the priesthood prior to their ordination.

During the War of the Spanish Succession Spanish troops encamped in his archdiocese but they never interfered with the exercise of his archiepiscopal duties. Warfare however produced refugees and Fénelon opened his palace to refugees fleeing the ongoing conflict.

For Fénelon all wars were civil wars. Humanity was a single society and all wars within it the greatest evil for he argued that ones obligation to mankind as a whole was always greater than what was owed to ones particular country.

During these latter years Fénelon wrote a series of anti-Jansenist works. The impetus was the publication of the Cas de Conscience which revived the old Jansenist distinction between questions of law and questions of fact and argued that though the church had the right to condemn certain opinions as heretical it did not have the right to oblige one to believe that these opinions were actually contained in Cornelius Jansens Augustinus. The treatises sermons and pastoral letters Fénelon wrote in response occupy seven volumes in his collected works. Fénelon particularly condemned Pasquier Quesnels Réflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament. His writings contributed to the tide of scholarly opinion which led to Pope Clement XIs 1713 bull Unigenitus condemning Quesnels opinions.

Although confined to the Cambrai archdiocese in his later years Fénelon continued to act as a spiritual director for Mme de Maintenon as well as the ducs de de Chevreuse and de Beauvilliers the duke of Burgundy and other prominent individuals.

Fénelons later years were blighted by the deaths of many of his close friends. Shortly before his death he asked Louis XIV to replace him with a man opposed to Jansenism and loyal to the Sulpician order. He died on 7 January 1715.

Fénelon wrote about the dangers of power in government. Historian Paul Hazard remarks that the author posed hard questions for his fictional hero Telemachus to put to Idomeneus King of Salente 

Fénelon defended universal human rights and the unity of humankind. He wrote

A people is no less a member of the human race which is society as a whole than a family is a member of a particular nation. Each individual owes incomparably more to the human race which is the great fatherland than to the particular country in which he was born. As a family is to the nation so is the nation to the universal commonweal; wherefore it is infinitely more harmful for nation to wrong nation than for family to wrong family. To abandon the sentiment of humanity is not merely to renounce civilization and to relapse into barbarism it is to share in the blindness of the most brutish brigands and savages; it is to be a man no longer but a cannibal.

He also wrote of womens education as a means against heresy.

The world is not abstraction; it is the sum total of families; and who can civilize it more effectively than women . . . . are scarcely less important to the public than those of men since women have a household to rule a husband to make happy and children to bring up well. . . . In short one has to consider not only the good which women do when they are well brought up but also the evil which they cause in the world when they lack an education which inspire them to virtue..."
Pierre de Fermat,"Pierre de Fermat was a French mathematician who is given credit for early developments that led to infinitesimal calculus including his technique of adequality. In particular he is recognized for his discovery of an original method of finding the greatest and the smallest ordinates of curved lines which is analogous to that of differential calculus then unknown and his research into number theory. He made notable contributions to analytic geometry probability and optics. He is best known for his Fermats principle for light propagation and his Fermats Last Theorem in number theory which he described in a note at the margin of a copy of Diophantus Arithmetica. He was also a lawyer at the Parlement of Toulouse France.

Fermat was born in 1607 in Beaumont-de-Lomagne Francethe late 15th-century mansion where Fermat was born is now a museum. He was from Gascony where his father Dominique Fermat was a wealthy leather merchant and served three one-year terms as one of the four consuls of Beaumont-de-Lomagne. His mother was Claire de Long. Pierre had one brother and two sisters and was almost certainly brought up in the town of his birth.

He attended the University of Orléans from 1623 and received a bachelor in civil law in 1626 before moving to Bordeaux. In Bordeaux he began his first serious mathematical researches and in 1629 he gave a copy of his restoration of Apolloniuss De Locis Planis to one of the mathematicians there. Certainly in Bordeaux he was in contact with Beaugrand and during this time he produced important work on maxima and minima which he gave to Étienne dEspagnet who clearly shared mathematical interests with Fermat. There he became much influenced by the work of François Viète.

In 1630 he bought the office of a councilor at the Parlement de Toulouse one of the High Courts of Judicature in France and was sworn in by the Grand Chambre in May 1631. He held this office for the rest of his life. Fermat thereby became entitled to change his name from Pierre Fermat to Pierre de Fermat. On 1 June 1631 Fermat married Louise de Long a fourth cousin of his mother Claire de Fermat . The Fermats had eight children five of whom survived to adulthood Clément-Samuel Jean Claire Catherine and Louise.

Fluent in six languages Fermat was praised for his written verse in several languages and his advice was eagerly sought regarding the emendation of Greek texts. He communicated most of his work in letters to friends often with little or no proof of his theorems. In some of these letters to his friends he explored many of the fundamental ideas of calculus before Newton or Leibniz. Fermat was a trained lawyer making mathematics more of a hobby than a profession. Nevertheless he made important contributions to analytical geometry probability number theory and calculus. Secrecy was common in European mathematical circles at the time. This naturally led to priority disputes with contemporaries such as Descartes and Wallis.

Anders Hald writes that The basis of Fermats mathematics was the classical Greek treatises combined with Vietas new algebraic methods.

Fermats pioneering work in analytic geometry was circulated in manuscript form in 1636 predating the publication of Descartes famous La géométrie which exploited the work. This manuscript was published posthumously in 1679 in Varia opera mathematica as Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge .

In Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam and in De tangentibus linearum curvarum Fermat developed a method for determining maxima minima and tangents to various curves that was equivalent to differential calculus. In these works Fermat obtained a technique for finding the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures which led to his further work in quadrature.

Fermat was the first person known to have evaluated the integral of general power functions. With his method he was able to reduce this evaluation to the sum of geometric series. The resulting formula was helpful to Newton and then Leibniz when they independently developed the fundamental theorem of calculus.

In number theory Fermat studied Pells equation perfect numbers amicable numbers and what would later become Fermat numbers. It was while researching perfect numbers that he discovered Fermats little theorem. He invented a factorization methodFermats factorization methodand popularized the proof by infinite descent which he used to prove Fermats right triangle theorem which includes as a corollary Fermats Last Theorem for the case n 4. Fermat developed the two-square theorem and the polygonal number theorem which states that each number is a sum of three triangular numbers four square numbers five pentagonal numbers and so on.

Although Fermat claimed to have proven all his arithmetic theorems few records of his proofs have survived. Many mathematicians including Gauss doubted several of his claims especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat. His famous Last Theorem was first discovered by his son in the margin in his fathers copy of an edition of Diophantus and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof. It seems that he had not written to Marin Mersenne about it. It was first proven in 1994 by Sir Andrew Wiles using techniques unavailable to Fermat.

Through their correspondence in 1654 Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped lay the foundation for the theory of probability. From this brief but productive collaboration on the problem of points they are now regarded as joint founders of probability theory. Fermat is credited with carrying out the first-ever rigorous probability calculation. In it he was asked by a professional gambler why if he bet on rolling at least one six in four throws of a die he won in the long term whereas betting on throwing at least one double-six in 24 throws of two dice resulted in his losing. Fermat showed mathematically why this was the case.

The first variational principle in physics was articulated by Euclid in his Catoptrica. It says that for the path of light reflecting from a mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Hero of Alexandria later showed that this path gave the shortest length and the least time. Fermat refined and generalized this to light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time now known as the principle of least time. For this Fermat is recognized as a key figure in the historical development of the fundamental principle of least action in physics. The terms Fermats principle and Fermat functional were named in recognition of this role.

Pierre de Fermat died on January 12 1665 at Castres in the present-day department of Tarn. The oldest and most prestigious high school in Toulouse is named after him the Lycée Pierre-de-Fermat. French sculptor Théophile Barrau made a marble statue named Hommage à Pierre Fermat as a tribute to Fermat now at the Capitole de Toulouse.

Together with René Descartes Fermat was one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century. According to Peter L. Bernstein in his 1996 book Against the Gods Fermat was a mathematician of rare power. He was an independent inventor of analytic geometry he contributed to the early development of calculus he did research on the weight of the earth and he worked on light refraction and optics. In the course of what turned out to be an extended correspondence with Blaise Pascal he made a significant contribution to the theory of probability. But Fermats crowning achievement was in the theory of numbers.

Regarding Fermats work in analysis Isaac Newton wrote that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from Fermats way of drawing tangents.

Of Fermats number theoretic work the 20th-century mathematician André Weil wrote that what we possess of his methods for dealing with curves of genus 1 is remarkably coherent; it is still the foundation for the modern theory of such curves. It naturally falls into two parts; the first one ... may conveniently be termed a method of ascent in contrast with the descent which is rightly regarded as Fermats own. Regarding Fermats use of ascent Weil continued The novelty consisted in the vastly extended use which Fermat made of it giving him at least a partial equivalent of what we would obtain by the systematic use of the group theoretical properties of the rational points on a standard cubic. With his gift for number relations and his ability to find proofs for many of his theorems Fermat essentially created the modern theory of numbers."
Jean-Marc Ferry,"Jean-Marc Ferry is a French philosopher who is best known for his book Les puissances de lexpérience described by Paul Ricoeur as one of the most important works recently published in the field of social and political philosophy. He has also translated the work of Jürgen Habermas by whom he was influenced into French.

According to Ferry the forms of discourse through which identity is constructed are narration interpretation argumentation and reconstruction. P. Smith summarizes Ferry as follows

Historical and discursive progress from narration toward reconstruction is associated with increasing reflexivity about identity and the grounds upon which it is established. Narration in Ferrys view consists of ossified traditional myths which define identities in a more or less prescriptive taken-forgranted way. Interpretation on the other hand involves the assimilation of identity to universal categories like law and justice and is exemplified in early Christian and ancient Greek thought. Argumentation opens up claims of identity to rational dialogue as embodied for example in the Enlightenment. Reconstruction the final step toward reflexivity involves hermeneutic attempts to understand the historical grounds behind the good reasons offered by others in argumentation. This is in part a logical and ethical consequence of the shift from it to you which emerges with argumentation itself.

Ferry also discusses what he considers to be the building of postnational identity in Europe a way to think of the European Union as a medium to separate national identity and political identity. The former and the latter are unified in the classical Nation-State but separated by the process of the building of a new Europe whose ultimate political identity is not the Nation-State but a Political Community which according to Ferry is not a Federal State nor a State in general but an absolutely other form of political construction. This new construction derives from the experience of World Wars I II which Ferry believes forced the European people to organize their inter-relationship beyond classical models of sovereignty and warfare.

On 15 September 2010 Ferry supported the new initiative Spinelli Group in the European Parliament which was founded to reinvigorate the strive for federalisation of the European Union . Other prominent supporters of the initiative are Jacques Delors Daniel Cohn-Bendit Guy Verhofstadt Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok."
Luc Ferry,"Luc Ferry is a French philosopher and politician and a proponent of secular humanism. He is a former member of the Saint-Simon Foundation think-tank.

He received an Agrégation de philosophie a Doctorate in Political science and an Agrégation in political science .As a professor of political science and political philosophy Luc Ferry taught at the Institut détudes politiques de Lyon during which time he also taught and directed graduate research at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne then at the University of Caen . He finally was a professor at Paris Diderot University from 1996 until he resigned in 2011 when asked to actually teach there.

From 2002 and until 2004 he served as the Minister of Education on the cabinet led by the conservative Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. During his tenure he was the minister in charge of the implementation of the French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. He received the award of Docteur honoris causa from the Université de Sherbrooke . He is the 2013 Telesio Galilei Academy of science Laureate for Philosophy.

He was created Chevalier of the Bacchanalian fraternity De La Dive Bouteille De Gaillac on the 20 March 2012 together with French mathematician Max Karoubi and Italian philosopher Francesco Fucilla.

He is the creator of the comic book series La Sagesse des mythes which is based on Greek mythology and is published since 2016.

Despite repeated efforts Luc Ferry was rejected for the third time by the Académie Française in January 2019.

As a humanist Ferry is highly critical of animal rights deep ecology and environmentalism which he dismisses for elevating the moral status of nature.

In June 2011 Ferry announced on television that he knew about a former government minister who had sexually abused young boys in an orgy in Morocco. According to him the case was known at the highest levels of the French state but he provided no specifics as to the persons involved citing the risk of being sued for libel. A criminal investigation was then opened and he was asked to cooperate with the prosecutors.

In June 2011 Le Canard enchaîné Le Monde and other media revealed that Luc Ferry a professor at Paris Diderot University since 1996 had not ever taught therewhen he was minister he was on leave and when not on leave his obligation to teach was waived in order for him to undertake other official duties. Some of those came with compensation pay while he was still paid as a professor. In 2010 however a change in legislation made the University financially autonomous. It did not want to have professors on its payroll that did not teach which may have made its president liable for misuse of public funds; it then required Luc Ferry to do his allocated teaching share which he declined to do. In 2011 according to some sources the university is threatening to get him to refund his salary ."
André-Jean Festugière,André-Jean Festugière O.P. was a French Dominican friar philosopher philologist and expert on Neoplatonism and in particular the works of Proclus. He is also notable for his translation of the works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.
Alain Finkielkraut,"Alain Finkielkraut is a French philosopher and public intellectual. He has written books and essays on a wide range of topics many on the ideas of tradition and identitary nonviolence including Jewish identity and antisemitism French colonialism the mission of the French education system in immigrant assimilation and the Yugoslav Wars. He often appears on French television.

He joined the Department of French Literature in the University of California Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1976 and from 1989 to 2014 he was professor of History of Ideas in the École Polytechnique department of humanities and social sciences. He was elected member of the Académie française on 10 April 2014.

As a thinker Finkielkraut defines himself as being at the same time classical and romantic. Finkielkraut deplores what he sees as the deterioration of Western tradition through multiculturalism and relativism. 

In 2010 he was involved in founding JCall a left-wing advocacy group based in Europe to lobby the European Parliament on foreign policy issues concerning the Middle East and Israel in particular.

Finkielkraut is the son of a Polish Jewish manufacturer of fine leather goods who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Finkielkraut studied modern literature at the École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud. Broadly speaking his ideas may be described as being in the same vein as those of Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah Arendt a filiation he has repeatedly pointed out.

Finkielkraut first came to public attention when he and Pascal Bruckner co-authored a number of short but controversial essays intended to question the idea that a new emancipation was underway; these included The New Love Disorder and At the Corner of the Street as well as The Adventure . Finkielkraut then began publishing singly authored works on the publics betrayal of memory and our intransigence in the presence of events that he argued should move the public. This reflection led Finkielkraut to address post-Holocaust Jewish identity in Europe . Seeking to promote what he calls a duty of memory Finkielkraut also published The Future of a Negation Reflexion on the Genocide Issue and later his comments on the Klaus Barbie trial Remembering in Vain .

Finkielkraut feels particularly indebted to Emmanuel Levinas. In The Wisdom of Love Finkielkraut discusses this debt in terms of modernity and its mirages. Finkielkraut continues his reflection on the matter in The Defeat of the Mind and The Ingratitude Talks About Our Times .

At the end of the 1990s he founded with Benny Lévy and Bernard-Henri Lévy an Institute on Levinassian Studies at Jerusalem.

In recent years Alain Finkielkraut has given his opinion on a variety of topics in society such as the Internet in The Internet The Troubling Ecstasy . In the book Present Imperfect akin to a personal diary he expresses his thoughts about various events in the world .

In 1995 Finkielkraut denounced the Cannes Film Festivals jury award saying

In recognizing Underground the Cannes jury thought it was honouring a creator with a thriving imagination. In fact it has honoured a servile and flashy illustrator of criminal clichés. The Cannes jury... praised a version of the most hackneyed and deceitful Serb propaganda. The devil himself could not have conceived so cruel an outrage against Bosnia nor such a grotesque epilogue to Western incompetence and frivolity.

It was later revealed that Finkielkraut had not seen the film before writing his criticism.

His interview published in the Haaretz magazine in November 2005 in which he gave his opinion about the 2005 French riots stirred up much controversy. Finkielkrauts remarked that the France national football team was black black black which causes sneers all over Europe adding that if you point this out in France you are thrown in jail. He also denounced African-American Muslims claiming that there is an Islamization of the blacks happening in both America and France.

Anti-Zionist filmmaker Eyal Sivan took legal action against Finkielkraut after the Frenchman said Sivan is if you will one of the actors in this particularly painful particularly alarming reality the Jewish anti-Semitism that rages today.

In 2009 he was criticized for his comment on Roman Polanski sexual offence in which a 13-year-old girl was involved. Finkielkraut claimed that she was a teenager not a child.

He has been criticized for his close friendship with Croatian president Franjo Tuđman and was accused by David Bruce MacDonald of supporting a nation whose leader was a Holocaust revisionist at the helm of an authoritarian government.

In August 2018 Finkielkraut expressed in an interview with The Times of Israel his worries for French Jews and the future of France The anti-Semitism were now experiencing in France is the worst Ive ever seen in my lifetime and Im convinced its going to get worse.

On 16 February 2019 Finkielkraut was accosted on the street by a group of yellow vest protesters in Paris when they chanced on him in Boulevard du Montparnasse. A 36-year-old French convert to Islam was indicted after saying that Finkelkraut was going to die. Finkelkraut had previously expressed his sympathy for the yellow vest movement. In April Finkelkraut stated that he had been repeatedly accosted by street protestors and told reporters I can no longer show my face on the street.

In April 2019 IEP announced the cancellation of a forum where Finkielkraut was to be a speaker due to threats by antifas. Eugénie Bastié of Le Figaro denounced the cancellation as a gangrenous symptom of the Americanisation of French university life. The announcement was intended to mislead far-left protestors and the lecture went on in a different location.

While on the French TV channel LCI he commented on the Duhamel scandal involving incest with a 13-14 boy and his father-in-law. Finkielkraut analyzed the affair from a post-68 perspective and described the victim as a teenager as a result of which he was summarily fired within days by the French TV news network he was working for as a commentator."
Edmond Fleg,"Edmond Flegenheimer better known as Edmond Fleg was a Jewish French writer thinker novelist essayist and playwright of the 20th century. Flegs oeuvre was crucial in constructing a modern French Jewish identity rendering him an instrumental figure in the Jewish awakening during the interwar years.After World War IJewish writers began articulating a new cultural definition of what it meant to be a Jew within the context ofFrench Third Republic universalism. Through his writings based on Jewish and Christian textsFleg formed the foundation of a modern French Jewish spirituality and self-understanding which allowed secular French Jews to preserve their Jewish identity. In doing so Fleg was calling for an exploration of the living texts of traditional Judaism as the basis for a modern Jewish identity establishing a new literary direction devoted to re-interpreting biblical texts and legends and liturgies.

Edmond Fleg was born in Geneva on 26 November 1874 to a Swiss-based Alsatian Jewish family. At the time of his birth Flegs parents were residing in Geneva but their familial roots were in France. Given their connection to France Flegs family expressed a strong loyalty to the emancipatory values of the French Revolution when Jews were granted full citizenship. As French-identified Jews Flegs parents found the principles of Judaism as they understood them to be identical with the liberal ideals of the French revolution tolerance equality and freedom.

Throughout his childhood Fleg received both a religious and secular education. As a young boy Fleg quickly began to question god spirituality and religion. While reflecting on his Bar Mitzvah Fleg recalled I had no understanding of Hebrew I didnt understand one word. According to Fleg the entire spectacle felt artificial to him. Years later he would say lying in bed my soul was searching asking the Eternal to show me when Judaism had become so distasteful. He developed a disdain for his parents apparent inconsistencies and found the rabbi and cantor to be boring and uninspiring.

He began his formal education first in Paris at the Lycée Louis Le Grand and then at École Normale Supérieure. Both institutions were known for its emphasis on Neo-Kantianism which appealed to middle-class Frenchman such as Fleg. In 1899 he qualified as a teacher of the German language.He became the best friend of the editor Lucien Moreau later one of the leaders of the Action Française. They agreed that Jewish and French nationalisms traveled in parallel lines and rejected assimilation.

During World War One Fleg joined the French Foreign Legion in order to fight for his adopted country. He won the Croix de Guerre and he was honored later in 1937 by being made an officer of the Legion of Honor.

From 1904 to 1920 Fleg was a successful playwright.His work was influenced by the disturbances caused by the Dreyfus affair by his participation in the Third Zionist Congress in Basel and by the reports of pogroms.The antisemitism unleashed by the Dreyfus affair which put France in turmoil shattered Flegs world view. Fleg would later write Initially the Dreyfus Affair passed unnoticed for me...but later it pushed me into reality and the Jewish problem. It became very difficult to forget completely that you were a Jew. As the affair progressed Fleg had no doubt that Dreyfus was innocent. This woke Fleg up to the political and social realities around him. Fleg came to believe that the injustice was a sign that he shared the same destiny of Dreyfus by the mere fact that they were both Jews whether he liked it or not. Fleg and other Franco-Jewish intellectuals developed a deep sense of betrayal and many began openly identifying as Dreyfusards. This is also when Fleg heard for the first time about Zionism.

Ecoute Israël appeared between 1913 and 1948 and the Anthologie juive from 1923 to 1953.In 1928 F. die Schrift published his Pourquoi je suis juif.In 1949 he was co-founder of the Amitiés judéo-chrétiennes.His 1960 work Vers le Monde qui vient gave his message of hope with which he wanted to build a bridge to Christianity.

Both of Flegs sons were killed fighting for France in the Second World War.

Edmond Flegs writing can be divided into three main categories religious poetry biographical works and autobiographical and other essays on Jewish themes. Considered to be one of Frances leading writers he authored countless essays 17 plays and operas 10 books of poetry and four novels. He also he compiled anthologies and translated and adapted work by other writers and poets.

He translated a part of the Bible in French; Genesis in 1946 and Exodus in 1963."
Michel Foucault,"Paul-Michel Foucault was a French philosopher historian of ideas writer political activist and literary critic.

Foucaults theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics especially those working in communication studies anthropology psychology sociology criminology cultural studies literary theory feminism Marxism and critical theory.

Born in Poitiers France into an upper-middle-class family Foucault was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV at the École Normale Supérieure where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser and at the University of Paris where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad he returned to France and published his first major book The History of Madness . After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand he produced The Birth of the Clinic and The Order of Things publications which displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called archaeology.

From 1966 to 1968 Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge . In 1970 Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish and The History of Sexuality in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.

Foucault died in Paris from complications of HIVAIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory.

Paul-Michel Foucault was born on 15 October 1926 in the city of Poitiers west-central France as the second of three children in a prosperous socially-conservative upper-middle-class family. Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father Paul Foucault but his mother insisted on the addition of Michel; referred to as Paul at school he expressed a preference for Michel throughout his life.

His father a successful local surgeon born in Fontainebleau moved to Poitiers where he set up his own practice. He married Anne Malapert the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers School of Medicine. Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-laws medical practice while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house Le Piroir in the village of Vendeuvre-du-Poitou. Together the couple had three childrena girl named Francine and two boys Paul-Michel and Denyswho all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes. The children were raised to be nominal Catholics attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair and while Michel briefly became an altar boy none of the family was devout.

In later life Foucault revealed very little about his childhood. Describing himself as a juvenile delinquent he claimed his father was a bully who sternly punished him. In 1930 two years early Foucault began his schooling at the local Lycée Henry-IV. There he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main lycée where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards he took his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment excelling in French Greek Latin and history though doing poorly at mathematics including arithmetic.

In 1939 the Second World War began followed by Nazi Germanys occupation of France in 1940. Foucaults parents opposed the occupation and the Vichy regime but did not join the Resistance. That year Foucaults mother enrolled him in the Collège Saint-Stanislas a strict Catholic institution run by the Jesuits. Although he later described his years there as an ordeal Foucault excelled academically particularly in philosophy history and literature. In 1942 he entered his final year the terminale where he focused on the study of philosophy earning his baccalauréat in 1943.

Returning to the local Lycée Henry-IV he studied history and philosophy for a year aided by a personal tutor the philosopher Louis Girard. Rejecting his fathers wishes that he become a surgeon in 1945 Foucault went to Paris where he enrolled in one of the countrys most prestigious secondary schools which was also known as the Lycée Henri-IV. Here he studied under the philosopher Jean Hyppolite an existentialist and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the dialectical theories of Hegel and Karl Marx. These ideas influenced Foucault who adopted Hyppolites conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.

I wasnt always smart I was actually very stupid in school ... here was a boy who was very attractive who was even stupider than I was. And to ingratiate myself with this boy who was very beautiful I began to do his homework for himand thats how I became smart I had to do all this work to just keep ahead of him a little bit to help him. In a sense all the rest of my life Ive been trying to do intellectual things that would attract beautiful boys.

In autumn 1946 attaining excellent results Foucault was admitted to the élite École Normale Supérieure for which he undertook exams and an oral interrogation by Georges Canguilhem and Pierre-Maxime Schuhl to gain entry. Of the hundred students entering the ENS Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates he lived in the schools communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue dUlm.

He remained largely unpopular spending much time alone reading voraciously. His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the Napoleonic Wars by Spanish artist Francisco Goya and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger. Prone to self-harm in 1948 Foucault allegedly attempted suicide; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist Jean Delay at the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center. Obsessed with the idea of self-mutilation and suicide Foucault attempted the latter several times in ensuing years praising suicide in later writings. The ENSs doctor examined Foucaults state of mind suggesting that his suicidal tendencies emerged from the distress surrounding his homosexuality because same-sex sexual activity was socially taboo in France. At the time Foucault engaged in homosexual activity with men whom he encountered in the underground Parisian gay scene also indulging in drug use; according to biographer James Miller he enjoyed the thrill and sense of danger that these activities offered him.

Although studying various subjects Foucault soon gravitated towards philosophy reading not only Hegel and Marx but also Immanuel Kant Edmund Husserl and most significantly Martin Heidegger. He began reading the publications of philosopher Gaston Bachelard taking a particular interest in his work exploring the history of science. He graduated from the ENS with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1948 and a DES in Philosophy in 1949. His DES thesis under the direction of Hyppolite was titled La Constitution dun transcendental dans La Phénoménologie de lesprit de Hegel .

In 1948 the philosopher Louis Althusser became a tutor at the ENS. A Marxist he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students encouraging them to join the French Communist Party. Foucault did so in 1950 but never became particularly active in its activities and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint rejecting core Marxist tenets such as class struggle. He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the partys ranks; he personally faced homophobia and was appalled by the anti-semitism exhibited during the 195253 Doctors plot in the Soviet Union. He left the Communist Party in 1953 but remained Althussers friend and defender for the rest of his life. Although failing at the first attempt in 1950 he passed his agrégation in philosophy on the second try in 1951. Excused from national service on medical grounds he decided to start a doctorate at the Fondation Thiers in 1951 focusing on the philosophy of psychology but he relinquished it after only one year in 1952.

Foucault was also interested in psychology and he attended Daniel Lagaches lectures at the University of Paris where he obtained a B.A. in Psychology in 1949 and a Diploma in Psychopathology from the Universitys Institute of Psychology in June 1952.

Over the following few years Foucault embarked on a variety of research and teaching jobs. From 1951 to 1955 he worked as a psychology instructor at the ENS at Althussers invitation. In Paris he shared a flat with his brother who was training to become a surgeon but for three days in the week commuted to the northern town of Lille teaching psychology at the Université de Lille from 1953 to 1954. Many of his students liked his lecturing style. Meanwhile he continued working on his thesis visiting the Bibliothèque Nationale every day to read the work of psychologists like Ivan Pavlov Jean Piaget and Karl Jaspers. Undertaking research at the psychiatric institute of the Sainte-Anne Hospital he became an unofficial intern studying the relationship between doctor and patient and aiding experiments in the electroencephalographic laboratory. Foucault adopted many of the theories of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud undertaking psychoanalytical interpretation of his dreams and making friends undergo Rorschach tests.

Embracing the Parisian avant-garde Foucault entered into a romantic relationship with the serialist composer Jean Barraqué. Together they tried to produce their greatest work heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity. In August 1953 Foucault and Barraqué holidayed in Italy where the philosopher immersed himself in Untimely Meditations a set of four essays by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Later describing Nietzsches work as a revelation he felt that reading the book deeply affected him being a watershed moment in his life. Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of Samuel Becketts new play Waiting for Godot in 1953.

Interested in literature Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher Maurice Blanchots book reviews published in Nouvelle Revue Française. Enamoured of Blanchots literary style and critical theories in later works he adopted Blanchots technique of interviewing himself. Foucault also came across Hermann Brochs 1945 novel The Death of Virgil a work that obsessed both him and Barraqué. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an epic opera Foucault admired Brochs text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life. The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the Marquis de Sade Fyodor Dostoyevsky Franz Kafka and Jean Genet all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.

I belong to that generation who as students had before their eyes and were limited by a horizon consisting of Marxism phenomenology and existentialism. For me the break was first Becketts Waiting for Godot a breathtaking performance.

Interested in the work of Swiss psychologist Ludwig Binswanger Foucault aided family friend Jacqueline Verdeaux in translating his works into French. Foucault was particularly interested in Binswangers studies of Ellen West who like himself had a deep obsession with suicide eventually killing herself. In 1954 Foucault authored an introduction to Binswangers paper Dream and Existence in which he argued that dreams constituted the birth of the world or the heart laid bare expressing the minds deepest desires. That same year Foucault published his first book Maladie mentale et personalité in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of sociologists and anthropologists such as Émile Durkheim and Margaret Mead he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative. Biographer James Miller noted that while the book exhibited erudition and evident intelligence it lacked the kind of fire and flair which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works. It was largely critically ignored receiving only one review at the time. Foucault grew to despise it unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.

Foucault spent the next five years abroad first in Sweden working as cultural diplomat at the University of Uppsala a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion Georges Dumézil. At Uppsala he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career. Although finding it difficult to adjust to the Nordic gloom and long winters he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen biochemist Jean-François Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-Lépine and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new Jaguar car. In spring 1956 Barraqué broke from his relationship with Foucault announcing that he wanted to leave the vertigo of madness. In Uppsala Foucault spent much of his spare time in the universitys Carolina Rediviva library making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research. Finishing his doctoral thesis Foucault hoped that Uppsala University would accept it but Sten Lindroth a positivistic historian of science there remained unimpressed asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection Foucault left Sweden. Later Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.

Again at Dumézils behest in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the capital of Polish Peoples Republic Warsaw and took charge of the University of Warsaws Centre Français. Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the Polish October of 1956 when students had protested against the governing communist Polish United Workers Party he felt that most Poles despised their government as a puppet regime of the Soviet Union and thought that the system ran badly. Considering the university a liberal enclave he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular he adopted the position of de facto cultural attaché. Like France and Sweden Poland legally tolerated but socially frowned on homosexual activity and Foucault undertook relationships with a number of men; one was with a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation which therefore would reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination. Various positions were available in West Germany and so Foucault relocated to the Institut français Hamburg teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw. Spending much time in the Reeperbahn red light district he entered into a relationship with a transvestite.

Histoire de la folie is not an easy text to read and it defies attempts to summarise its contents. Foucault refers to a bewildering variety of sources ranging from well-known authors such as Erasmus and Molière to archival documents and forgotten figures in the history of medicine and psychiatry. His erudition derives from years pondering to cite Poe over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore and his learning is not always worn lightly.

In West Germany Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis for his State doctorate titled Folie et déraison Histoire de la folie à lâge classique a philosophical work based upon his studies into the history of medicine. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases the Renaissance the later 17th and 18th centuries and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud who exerted a strong influence over Foucaults thought at the time.

Histoire de la folie was an expansive work consisting of 943 pages of text followed by appendices and a bibliography. Foucault submitted it at the University of Paris although the universitys regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis. Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process. The first step was to obtain a rapporteur or sponsor for the work Foucault chose Georges Canguilhem. The second was to find a publisher and as a result Folie et déraison was published in French in May 1961 by the company Plon whom Foucault chose over Presses Universitaires de France after being rejected by Gallimard. In 1964 a heavily abridged version was published as a mass market paperback then translated into English for publication the following year as Madness and Civilization A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason.

Folie et déraison received a mixed reception in France and in foreign journals focusing on French affairs. Although it was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot Michel Serres Roland Barthes Gaston Bachelard and Fernand Braudel it was largely ignored by the leftist press much to Foucaults disappointment. It was notably criticised for advocating metaphysics by young philosopher Jacques Derrida in a March 1963 lecture at the University of Paris. Responding with a vicious retort Foucault criticised Derridas interpretation of René Descartes. The two remained bitter rivals until reconciling in 1981. In the English-speaking world the work became a significant influence on the anti-psychiatry movement during the 1960s; Foucault took a mixed approach to this associating with a number of anti-psychiatrists but arguing that most of them misunderstood his work.

Foucaults secondary thesis written in Hamburg between 1959 and 1960 was a translation and commentary on German philosopher Immanuel Kants Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View ; the thesis was titled Introduction à lAnthropologie. Largely consisting of Foucaults discussion of textual datingan archaeology of the Kantian texthe rounded off the thesis with an evocation of Nietzsche his biggest philosophical influence. This works rapporteur was Foucaults old tutor and then-director of the ENS Hyppolite who was well acquainted with German philosophy. After both theses were championed and reviewed he underwent his public defense of his doctoral thesis on 20 May 1961. The academics responsible for reviewing his work were concerned about the unconventional nature of his major thesis; reviewer Henri Gouhier noted that it was not a conventional work of history making sweeping generalisations without sufficient particular argument and that Foucault clearly thinks in allegories. They all agreed however that the overall project was of merit awarding Foucault his doctorate despite reservations.

In October 1960 Foucault took a tenured post in philosophy at the University of Clermont-Ferrand commuting to the city every week from Paris where he lived in a high-rise block on the rue du Dr Finlay. Responsible for teaching psychology which was subsumed within the philosophy department he was considered a fascinating but rather traditional teacher at Clermont. The department was run by Jules Vuillemin who soon developed a friendship with Foucault. Foucault then took Vuillemins job when the latter was elected to the Collège de France in 1962. In this position Foucault took a dislike to another staff member whom he considered stupid Roger Garaudy a senior figure in the Communist Party. Foucault made life at the university difficult for Garaudy leading the latter to transfer to Poitiers. Foucault also caused controversy by securing a university job for his lover the philosopher Daniel Defert with whom he retained a non-monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.

Foucault maintained a keen interest in literature publishing reviews in literary journals including Tel Quel and Nouvelle Revue Française and sitting on the editorial board of Critique. In May 1963 he published a book devoted to poet novelist and playwright Raymond Roussel. It was written in under two months published by Gallimard and was described by biographer David Macey as a very personal book that resulted from a love affair with Roussels work. It was published in English in 1983 as Death and the Labyrinth The World of Raymond Roussel. Receiving few reviews it was largely ignored. That same year he published a sequel to Folie et déraison titled Naissance de la Clinique subsequently translated as The Birth of the Clinic An Archaeology of Medical Perception. Shorter than its predecessor it focused on the changes that the medical establishment underwent in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Like his preceding work Naissance de la Clinique was largely critically ignored but later gained a cult following. It was of interest within the field of medical ethics as it considered the ways in which the history of medicine and hospitals and the training that those working within them receive bring about a particular way of looking at the body the medical gaze. Foucault was also selected to be among the Eighteen Man Commission that assembled between November 1963 and March 1964 to discuss university reforms that were to be implemented by Christian Fouchet the Gaullist Minister of National Education. Implemented in 1967 they brought staff strikes and student protests.

In April 1966 Gallimard published Foucaults Les Mots et les choses later translated as The Order of Things An Archaeology of the Human Sciences. Exploring how man came to be an object of knowledge it argued that all periods of history have possessed certain underlying conditions of truth that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse. Foucault argues that these conditions of discourse have changed over time from one periods épistémè to another. Although designed for a specialist audience the work gained media attention becoming a surprise bestseller in France. Appearing at the height of interest in structuralism Foucault was quickly grouped with scholars such as Jacques Lacan Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes as the latest wave of thinkers set to topple the existentialism popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre. Although initially accepting this description Foucault soon vehemently rejected it. Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press. Both Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir attacked Foucaults ideas as bourgeois while Foucault retaliated against their Marxist beliefs by proclaiming that Marxism exists in nineteenth-century thought as a fish exists in water; that is it ceases to breathe anywhere else.

I lived for two and a half years. It made a real impression. I was present for large violent student riots that preceded by several weeks what happened in May in France. This was March 1968. The unrest lasted a whole year strikes courses suspended arrests. And in March a general strike by the students. The police came into the university beat up the students wounded several of them seriously and started making arrests ... I have to say that I was tremendously impressed by those young men and women who took terrible risks by writing or distributing tracts or calling for strikes the ones who really risked losing their freedom It was a political experience for me.

In September 1966 Foucault took a position teaching psychology at the University of Tunis in Tunisia. His decision to do so was largely because his lover Defert had been posted to the country as part of his national service. Foucault moved a few kilometres from Tunis to the village of Sidi Bou Saïd where fellow academic Gérard Deledalle lived with his wife. Soon after his arrival Foucault announced that Tunisia was blessed by history a nation which deserves to live forever because it was where Hannibal and St. Augustine lived. His lectures at the university proved very popular and were well attended. Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views viewing him as a representative of Gaullist technocracy even though he considered himself a leftist.

Foucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967 and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events. While in Tunis Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist René Magritte Foucault started to write a book about the impressionist artist Édouard Manet but never completed it.

In 1968 Foucault returned to Paris moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard. After the May 1968 student protests Minister of Education Edgar Faure responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the Centre Expérimental de Vincennes in Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the centres departments and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department. Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes Foucaults desire was to obtain the best in French philosophy today for his department employing Michel Serres Judith Miller Alain Badiou Jacques Rancière François Regnault Henri Weber Étienne Balibar and François Châtelet; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.

Lectures began at the university in January 1969 and straight away its students and staff including Foucault were involved in occupations and clashes with police resulting in arrests. In February Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Maison de la Mutualité. Such actions marked Foucaults embrace of the ultra-left undoubtedly influenced by Defert who had gained a job at Vincennes sociology department and who had become a Maoist. Most of the courses at Foucaults philosophy department were MarxistLeninist oriented although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche The end of Metaphysics and The Discourse of Sexuality which were highly popular and over-subscribed. While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution new Minister of Education Olivier Guichard was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner. He refused national accreditation of the departments degrees resulting in a public rebuttal from Foucault.

Foucault desired to leave Vincennes and become a fellow of the prestigious Collège de France. He requested to join taking up a chair in what he called the history of systems of thought and his request was championed by members Dumézil Hyppolite and Vuillemin. In November 1969 when an opening became available Foucault was elected to the Collège though with opposition by a large minority. He gave his inaugural lecture in December 1970 which was subsequently published as LOrdre du discours . He was obliged to give 12 weekly lectures a yearand did so for the rest of his lifecovering the topics that he was researching at the time; these became one of the events of Parisian intellectual life and were repeatedly packed out events. On Mondays he also gave seminars to a group of students; many of them became a Foulcauldian tribe who worked with him on his research. He enjoyed this teamwork and collective research and together they published a number of short books. Working at the Collège allowed him to travel widely giving lectures in Brazil Japan Canada and the United States over the next 14 years. In 1970 and 1972 Foucault served as a professor in the French Department of the University at Buffalo in Buffalo New York.

In May 1971 Foucault co-founded the Groupe dInformation sur les Prisons along with historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach. The GIP aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. It was highly critical of the penal system believing that it converted petty criminals into hardened delinquents. The GIP gave press conferences and staged protests surrounding the events of the Toul prison riot in December 1971 alongside other prison riots that it sparked off; in doing so it faced a police crackdown and repeated arrests. The group became active across France with 2000 to 3000 members but disbanded before 1974. Also campaigning against the death penalty Foucault co-authored a short book on the case of the convicted murderer Pierre Rivière. After his research into the penal system Foucault published Surveiller et punir Naissance de la prison in 1975 offering a history of the system in western Europe. In it Foucault examines the penal evolution away from corporal and capital punishment to the penitentiary system that began in Europe and the United States around the end of the 18th century. Biographer Didier Eribon described it as perhaps the finest of Foucaults works and it was well received.

Foucault was also active in anti-racist campaigns; in November 1971 he was a leading figure in protests following the perceived racist killing of Arab migrant Djellali Ben Ali. In this he worked alongside his old rival Sartre the journalist Claude Mauriac and one of his literary heroes Jean Genet. This campaign was formalised as the Committee for the Defence of the Rights of Immigrants but there was tension at their meetings as Foucault opposed the anti-Israeli sentiment of many Arab workers and Maoist activists. At a December 1972 protest against the police killing of Algerian worker Mohammad Diab both Foucault and Genet were arrested resulting in widespread publicity. Foucault was also involved in founding the Agence de Press-Libération a group of leftist journalists who intended to cover news stories neglected by the mainstream press. In 1973 they established the daily newspaper Libération and Foucault suggested that they establish committees across France to collect news and distribute the paper and advocated a column known as the Chronicle of the Workers Memory to allow workers to express their opinions. Foucault wanted an active journalistic role in the paper but this proved untenable and he soon became disillusioned with Libération believing that it distorted the facts; he did not publish in it until 1980. In 1975 he had an LSD experience with Simeon Wade and Michael Stoneman in Death Valley California and later wrote it was the greatest experience of his life and that it profoundly changed his life and his work. In front of Zabriskie Point they took LSD while listening to a well-prepared music program Richard Strausss Four Last Songs followed by Charles Ivess Three Places in New England ending with a few avant-garde pieces by Stockhausen. According to Wade as soon as he came back to Paris Foucault scrapped the second History of Sexualitys manuscript and totally rethought the whole project.

In 1976 Gallimard published Foucaults Histoire de la sexualité la volonté de savoir a short book exploring what Foucault called the repressive hypothesis. It revolved largely around the concept of power rejecting both Marxist and Freudian theory. Foucault intended it as the first in a seven-volume exploration of the subject.Histoire de la sexualité was a best-seller in France and gained positive press but lukewarm intellectual interest something that upset Foucault who felt that many misunderstood his hypothesis. He soon became dissatisfied with Gallimard after being offended by senior staff member Pierre Nora. Along with Paul Veyne and François Wahl Foucault launched a new series of academic books known as Des travaux through the company Seuil which he hoped would improve the state of academic research in France. He also produced introductions for the memoirs of Herculine Barbin and My Secret Life.

Foucaults Histoire de la sexualité concentrates on the relation between truth and sex. He defines truth as a system of ordered procedures for the production distribution regulation circulation and operation of statements. Through this system of truth power structures are created and enforced. Though Foucaults definition of truth may differ from other sociologists before and after him his work with truth in relation to power structures such as sexuality has left a profound mark on social science theory. In his work he examines the heightened curiosity regarding sexuality that induced a world of perversion during the elite capitalist 18th and 19th century in the western world. According to Foucault in History of Sexuality society of the modern age is symbolized by the conception of sexual discourses and their union with the system of truth. In the world of perversion including extramarital affairs homosexual behavior and other such sexual promiscuities Foucault concludes that sexual relations of the kind are constructed around producing the truth. Sex became not only a means of pleasure but an issue of truth. Sex is what confines one to darkness but also what brings one to light.

Similarly in The History of Sexuality society validates and approves people based on how closely they fit the discursive mold of sexual truth. As Foucault reminds us in the 18th and 19th centuries the Church was the epitome of power structure within society. Thus many aligned their personal virtues with those of the Church further internalizing their beliefs on the meaning of sex. However those who unify their sexual relation to the truth become decreasingly obliged to share their internal views with those of the Church. They will no longer see the arrangement of societal norms as an effect of the Churchs deep-seated power structure.

There exists an international citizenry that has its rights and has its duties and that is committed to rise up against every abuse of power no matter who the author no matter who the victims. After all we are all ruled and as such we are in solidarity.

Foucault remained a political activist focusing on protesting government abuses of human rights around the world. He was a key player in the 1975 protests against the Spanish government who were set to execute 11 militants sentenced to death without fair trial. It was his idea to travel to Madrid with six others to give a press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris. In 1977 he protested the extradition of Klaus Croissant to West Germany and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979 he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.

In 1977 Italian newspaper Corriere della sera asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan and discovered the popular support for Islamism. Returning to France he was one of the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeinis Islamist movement for which he was widely criticised in the French press including by Iranian expatriates. Foucaults response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978 Foucault traveled to Japan where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.

Although remaining critical of power relations Foucault expressed cautious support for the Socialist Party government of François Mitterrand following its electoral victory in 1981. But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish governments crackdown on the 1982 demonstrations in Poland orchestrated by the Solidarity trade union. He and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu authored a document condemning Mitterrands inaction that was published in Libération and they also took part in large public protests on the issue. Foucault continued to support Solidarity and with his friend Simone Signoret traveled to Poland as part of a Médecins du Monde expedition taking time out to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp. He continued his academic research and in June 1984 Gallimard published the second and third volumes of Histoire de la sexualité. Volume two LUsage des plaisirs dealt with the techniques of self prescribed by ancient Greek pagan morality in relation to sexual ethics while volume three Le Souci de soi explored the same theme in the Greek and Latin texts of the first two centuries CE. A fourth volume Les Aveux de la chair was to examine sexuality in early Christianity but it was not finished.

In October 1980 Foucault became a visiting professor at the University of California Berkeley giving the Howison Lectures on Truth and Subjectivity while in November he lectured at the Humanities Institute at New York University. His growing popularity in American intellectual circles was noted by Time magazine while Foucault went on to lecture at UCLA in 1981 the University of Vermont in 1982 and Berkeley again in 1983 where his lectures drew huge crowds. Foucault spent many evenings in the San Francisco gay scene frequenting sado-masochistic bathhouses engaging in unprotected sex. He praised sado-masochistic activity in interviews with the gay press describing it as the real creation of new possibilities of pleasure which people had no idea about previously. Foucault contracted HIV and eventually developed AIDS. Little was known of the virus at the time; the first cases had only been identified in 1980. Foucault initially referred to AIDS as a dreamed-up disease. In summer 1983 he developed a persistent dry cough which concerned friends in Paris but Foucault insisted it was just a pulmonary infection. Only when hospitalized was Foucault correctly diagnosed; treated with antibiotics he delivered a final set of lectures at the Collège de France. Foucault entered Paris Hôpital de la Salpêtrièrethe same institution that he had studied in Madness and Civilisationon 10 June 1984 with neurological symptoms complicated by sepsis. He died in the hospital on 25 June.

On 26 June 1984 Libération announced Foucaults death mentioning the rumour that it had been brought on by AIDS. The following day Le Monde issued a medical bulletin cleared by his family that made no reference to HIVAIDS. On 29 June Foucaults la levée du corps ceremony was held in which the coffin was carried from the hospital morgue. Hundreds attended including activists and academic friends while Gilles Deleuze gave a speech using excerpts from The History of Sexuality. His body was then buried at Vendeuvre-du-Poitou in a small ceremony. Soon after his death Foucaults partner Daniel Defert founded the first national HIVAIDS organisation in France AIDES; a play on the French language word for help and the English language acronym for the disease. On the second anniversary of Foucaults death Defert publicly revealed that Foucaults death was AIDS-related in The Advocate.

Foucaults first biographer Didier Eribon described the philosopher as a complex many-sided character and that under one mask there is always another. He also noted that he exhibited an enormous capacity for work. At the ENS Foucaults classmates unanimously summed him up as a figure who was both disconcerting and strange and a passionate worker. As he aged his personality changed Eribon noted that while he was a tortured adolescent post-1960 he had become a radiant man relaxed and cheerful even being described by those who worked with him as a dandy. He noted that in 1969 Foucault embodied the idea of the militant intellectual.

Foucault was an atheist. He loved classical music particularly enjoying the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and became known for wearing turtleneck sweaters. After his death Foucaults friend Georges Dumézil described him as having possessed a profound kindness and goodness also exhibiting an intelligence literally knew no bounds. His life-partner Daniel Defert inherited his estate whose archive was sold to the Frances national library for 3.8m .

Politically Foucault was a leftist throughout much of his life though his particular stance within the left often changed. In the early 1950s while never adopting an orthodox Marxist viewpoint Foucault had been a member of the French Communist Party leaving the party after three years as he expressed disgust in the prejudice within its ranks against Jews and homosexuals. After spending some time working in Poland governed at the time as a socialist state by the Polish United Workers Party he became further disillusioned with communist ideology. As a result in the early 1960s Foucault was considered to be violently anticommunist by some of his detractors even though he was involved in leftist campaigns along with most of his students and colleagues.

Foucault was a proponent of adult-child underage sex and of pedophilia considering them a form of liberation for both actors; he argued young children could give sexual consent. In 1977 along with Jean-Paul Sartre Jacques Derrida and other intellectuals Foucault signed a petition to the French parliament calling for the decriminalization of all consensual sexual relations between adults and minors below the age of fifteen the age of consent in France.

Foucaults colleague Pierre Bourdieu summarized the philosophers thought as a long exploration of transgression of going beyond social limits always inseparably linked to knowledge and power.

The theme that underlies all Foucaults work is the relationship between power and knowledge and how the former is used to control and define the latter. What authorities claim as scientific knowledge are really just means of social control. Foucault shows how for instance in the eighteenth century madness was used to categorize and stigmatize not just the mentally ill but the poor the sick the homeless and indeed anyone whose expressions of individuality were unwelcome.

Philosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading noted that overall Foucaults work was dark and pessimistic. Though it does however leave some room for optimism in that it illustrates how the discipline of philosophy can be used to highlight areas of domination. In doing so as Stokes claimed the ways in which we are being dominated become better understood so that we may strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualizes people.

Later in his life Foucault explained that his work was less about analyzing power as a phenomenon than about trying to characterize the different ways in which contemporary society has expressed the use of power to objectivise subjects. These have taken three broad forms one involving scientific authority to classify and order knowledge about human populations; the second has been to categorize and normalise human subjects ; and the third relates to the manner in which the impulse to fashion sexual identities and train ones own body to engage in routines and practices ends up reproducing certain patterns within a given society.

In addition to his philosophical work Foucault also wrote on literature. Death and the Labyrinth The World of Raymond Roussel published in 1963 and translated in English in 1986 is Foucaults only book-length work on literature. He described it as by far the book I wrote most easily with the greatest pleasure and most rapidly. Foucault explores theory criticism and psychology with reference to the texts of Raymond Roussel one of the first notable experimental writers. Foucault also gave a lecture responding to Roland Barthes famous essay The Death of the Author titled What Is an Author in 1969 later published in full. According to literary theoretician Kornelije Kvas for Foucault denying the existence of a historical author on account of his her irrelevance for interpretation is absurd for the author is a function of the text that organizes its sense.

Foucaults analysis of power comes in two forms empirical and theoretical. The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses sovereign power disciplinary power and biopower.

Foucault is generally critical of theories that try to give absolute answers to everything. Therefore he considered his own theory of power to be closer to a method than a typical theory. According to Foucault most people misunderstand power. For this reason he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as

Foucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as power but claims that these theories of power cannot completely describe all forms of power. Foucault also claims that a liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.

Foucaults own theory of power begins on micro-level with singular force relations. Richard A. Lynch defines Foucaults concept of force relation as whatever in ones social interactions that pushes urges or compels one to do something. According to Foucault force relations are an effect of difference inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships . Force and power is however not something that a person or group holds instead power is a complex group of forces that comes from everything and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand is power on macro-level which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox according to Lynch since someone has to exert power while at the same time there can be no someone exerting this power. According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations

According to Foucault force relations are constantly changing constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch the purpose of Foucaults theory of power is to increase peoples awareness of how power has shaped their way of being thinking and acting and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being thinking and acting.

With sovereign power Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid where one person or a group of people holds the power while the normal people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereigns orders. A typical example of sovereign power is absolute monarchy.

In historical absolute monarchies crimes had been considered a personal offense against the sovereign and hisher power. The punishment was often public and spectacular partly to deter others from committing crimes but also to reinstate the sovereigns power. This was however both expensive and ineffective it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times when disciplinary power is dominant criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques to remold the criminal into a law abiding citizen.

According to Chloë Taylor a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life wealth services labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract to take life to enslave life etc. but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor the form of power that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes is concerned about is sovereign power. According to Hobbes people are free so long they are not literally placed in chains.

What Foucault calls disciplinary power aims to use bodies skills as effectively as possible. The more useful the body becomes the more obedient it also has to become. The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies skills but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.

Disciplinary power has individuals as its object target and instrument. According to Foucault individual is however a construct created by disciplinary power. The disciplinary powers techniques create a rational self-control which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesnt continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesnt oppress interests or desires but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior to reconstruct their thoughts desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories schools hospitals and prisons. Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements habits and skills. It focuses on details single movements their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules surveillance exams and controls. The activities follow certain plans whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.

Disciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies hierarchical observation normalizing judgement and exams. By hierarchical observation the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer but rather so a hierarchy of observers. An example of this is mental asylums during the 19th century when the psychiatrist was not the only observer but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement all deviations even small ones from correct behavior are punished repeated rule violations are punished extra exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behaviorpeople rankgradesetc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectify and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual track their development and compare their results to the norm.

According to Foucault the formula for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher Jeremy Benthams plan for the optimal prison the panopticon. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior . Foucault says this construction creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions such as mental asylums in the 19th century.

Marcelo Hoffman posits that an example of disciplinary power can be seen in Frederick Winslow Taylors book The Principles of Scientific Management. Taylors purpose was to increase the efficacy of workers by having their behavior controlled by the companys management. He mentions as an example an attempt to increase the amount of pig iron carried by each worker during a day from 12.5 tonnes to 47 tonnes without causing the workers to strike. Here Hoffman says is a clear example of how the disciplinary power tries to make the body more obedient the more useful it becomes. Taylor describes that he started out with observing his 75 workers to pick out the most skilled workers. He had studied the workers history character habits and ambitions. Here is an example of how the disciplinary power creates an individuality. One of the selected workers Schmidt was according to Taylor a man with high ambitions that valued a high salary. Schmidt accepted the terms given He would earn 61 more if he agreed to obey without protest the orders given to him by an appointed instructor. Schmidt was thereafter observed and controlled in every detail of his working day he was told when and how to work when to rest etc. According to Taylor Schmidt never failed to obey during the three years during which he was subjected to this detailed control and higher workload.

Another example mentioned by Taylor is taken from a different industry where Taylor had calculated the optimal workload for each worker. There Taylor had developed a system where every worker was not only continuously observed but also punished if they had failed to reach up to the daily quota the previous workday. Every day the workers received a yellow or white note at the end of each shift where yellow notes were given to those who had not reached the daily quota. Those who were given yellow notes were then threatened with redeployment to a working role better fit for their productive capacities which according to Taylor effectively led the workers to work harder. According to Taylor the workers who were given yellow notes were not immediately redeployed. Instead Taylor writes that a skilled teacher were sent to teach the workers how to do the work properly. The teachers job was however not only to teach the workers how to work more effectively but also to observe them and their working capacity. Besides this teacher Taylor also describes that the workers were observed by others such as administrators managers etc.

With biopower Foucault refers to power over bios power over populations. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people rather than external force. It encourages strengthens controls observes optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.

Biopower studies populations regarding number of births life expectancy public health housing migration crime which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm and tries to adjust control or eliminate these norm deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution to compensate for future lacks of labor power retirement homes etc. Yet another example is sex because sex is connected to population growth sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as perversion frigidity and sexual dysfunction. On a biopower-level the usage of contraceptives has been studied some social groups have been encouraged to have children while others have been discouraged or prevented from having children.

In the era of biopower death has become a scandal and a catastrophe but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to protect life itself. Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were a threat to the German health and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled would be better spent on viable Germans. Chloë Taylor also mentions the Iraq War was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to Al-Qaeda. However when the Bush and Blair administrations didnt find any evidence to support either of these theories the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation the cause of the war was said to be that Saddam Hussein had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times war has to be concealed under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.

During the 19th century slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality illness alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as unmoral and lazy. The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would take over because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of eugenics whose founder Francis Galton had been inspired by Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton society was preventing natural selection by helping the weak thus causing a spread of the negative qualities into the rest of the population.

According to Foucault the body is not something objective that stands outside of history and culture. Instead Foucault argues the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history by work diet body ideals exercise medical interventions etc. Foucault presents no theory of the body but does write about it in Discipline and Punish as well as in The History of Sexuality. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality madness and criminality. Further Foucault argues that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.

In Discipline and Punish Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power by manipulating bodiesbehavior also manipulates peoples minds. Foucault turns the common saying the body is the prison of the soul and instead posits that the soul is the prison of the body.

According to Foucault sexology has tried to exert itself as a science by referring to the material . In contrast to this Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience and that sex is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples gender identity sexual identity and sexual behavior power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate pathologize and correct peoples sexual and gendered behavior by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed normal behavior. For Foucault a normal sexuality is as much of a construct as a natural sexuality. Therefore Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time the popular discourse argued for a liberation of sexuality from a cultural moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault however argues that peoples opinions about and experiences of sexuality are always a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To liberate sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes its place. This however does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power and that there is simply no natural sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.

According to Foucault the body is not only an obedient and passive object that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the seed to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.

Foucaults view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to Johanna Oksala Foucaults influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay lesbian heterosexual etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists have with the help of Foucaults ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies through plastic surgery diet eating disorders etc. Foucaults historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as Judith Butler who used Foucaults theories about the relation between subject power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no true gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault naively presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjectsbodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists such as Susan Bordo and Kate Soper.

Johanna Oksala argues that Foucault by saying that sexsexuality are constructed doesnt deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression but rather to question and deny the identities that are posited as natural and essential by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.

Foucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history have been made into subjects. Subjectivity for Foucault is not a state of being but a practice an active being. According to Foucault the subject has by western philosophers usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power. Foucault talks of assujettissement which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault social norms are standards that people are encouraged to follow that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of assujettissement Foucault mentions homosexual a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that sodomy was previously considered a serious sexual deviation but a temporary one. Homosexuality however became a species a past a childhood and a type of life. Homosexuals has by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the normal sexuality. However Foucault argues the creation of a subjectivity such as homosexuality does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised the subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the pride parade.

According to Foucault scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system by classifying and categorizing people observing their behavior and treating them when their behavior has been considered abnormal. He defines discourse as a form of oppression that does not require physical force. He identifies its production as controlled selected organized and redistributed by a certain number of procedures which are driven by individuals aspiration of knowledge to create rules and systems that translate into social codes. Moreover discourse creates a force that extends beyond societal institutions and could be found in social and formal fields such as health care systems educational and law enforcement. The formation of these fields may seem to contribute to social development; however Foucault warns against discourses harmful aspects on society.

Sciences such as psychiatry biology medicine economy psychoanalysis psychology sociology ethnology pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational irrational normal abnormal human inhuman etc. By doing so they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms which are then internalized by people as truths. People have then adapted their behavior to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as normal. For example Foucault claims that psychological observationsurveillance and psychological discourses has created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also according to Foucault been a way for society to resist criticism criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.

According to Foucault subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally it is also something that is established in a persons relation to themselves. This can for example happen when a person is trying to find themselves or be themselves something Edward McGushin describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the true self the self is established in two levels as a passive object and as an active searcher. The ancient Cynics and the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche posited that the true self can only be found by going through great hardship andor danger. The ancient Stoics and 17th-century philosopher René Descartes however argued that the self can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is Socrates who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others where the debaters question each others foundational views and opinions. Foucault however argued that subjectivity is a process rather than a state of being. As such Foucault argued that there is no true self to be found. Rather so the self is constitutedcreated in activities such as the ones employed to find the self. In other words exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not reveal the true self according to Foucault but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However according to Foucault the form for the subject is in great part already constituted by power before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools workplaces households government institutions entertainment media and the healthcare sector all through disciplinary power contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.

Todd May defines Foucaults concept of freedom as that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this according to Foucault is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been createdaffected by power. According to May two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples way of being thinking and acting is described in the books where Foucault describes disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However May argues there will always be aspects of peoples formation that will be unknown to them hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.

Foucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limit their freedom. Freedom is thus not a state of being but a practice a way of being in relation to oneself to others and to the world. According to Todd May Foucaults concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached from such investigations people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of experimentation with different transformations. Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely May argues they may lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus May argues it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.

Foucaults alternative to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as critique. For Foucault there are no good and bad forms of subjectivity since they are all a result of power relations. In the same way Foucault argues there are no good and bad norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore Foucault argues it is always crucial to continue with the practice of critique. Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being a questioning of who we are and how this we came to be. Such a critical ontology of the present shows that peoples current being is in fact a historically contingent unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity it is also possible to change it. Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.

As an alternative to the modern search for the true self and as a part of the work of freedom Foucault discusses the antique Greek term epimeleia heautou care for the self . According to Foucault among the ancient Greek philosophers self-awareness was not a goal in itself but rather something that was sought after in order to care for oneself. Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls the art of living or technologies of the self. The goal of these techniques was according to Foucault to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this Foucault mentions meditation the stoic activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with ones values and goals and contemplation of nature. Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity that consists of reflecting on how small ones existence is when compared to the greater cosmos.

Foucault is described by Mary Beth Mader as an epistemological constructivist and historicist. Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach absolute knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucaults works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather Foucault argues that we always begin anew when it comes to knowledge. At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking spirituality. With spirituality Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the cartesian moment the moment when René Descartes reached the insight that self-awareness was something given and from this insight Descartes drew conclusions about God the world and knowledge. According to Foucault since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times Foucault argues anyone can reach knowledge as long as they are rational beings educated willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this modern view of knowledge.

Foucault describes two types of knowledge savoir and connaissance two French terms that both can be translated as knowledge but with separate meanings for Foucault. By savoir Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences subjects such as the rational person the mentally ill person the law abiding person the criminal etc. are created and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is connaissance while the process in which subjects and knowledge is created is savoir. A similar term in Foucaults corpus is pouvoirsavoir . With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered common sense but that is created and withheld in that position by power. The term powerknowledge comes from Jeremy Benthams idea that panopticons wouldnt only be prisons but would be used for experiments where the criminals behaviour would be studied. Powerknowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals measures differences establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized . Because then when the norm is internalized and institutionalized it has effectively become a part of peoples common sense the obvious the given the natural. When this has happened this common sense also affects the explicit knowledge Foucault argues. Ellen K. Feder states that the premise the world consists of women and men is an example of this. This premise Feder argues has been considered common sense and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis gender identity disorder . For example during the 1970s children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of powerknowledge since psychiatry from the common sense premise the world consists of women and men created a new diagnosis a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.

Foucaults works have exercised a powerful influence over numerous humanistic and social scientific disciplines as one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. According to a London School of Economics analysis in 2016 his works Discipline and Punish and The History of Sexuality were among the 25 most cited books in the social sciences of all time at just over 100000 citations. In 2007 Foucault was listed as the single most cited scholar in the humanities by the ISI Web of Science among a large quantity of French philosophers the compilations author commenting that What this says of modern scholarship is for the reader to decideand it is imagined that judgments will vary from admiration to despair depending on ones view.

Foucaults work on biopower has been widely influential within the disciplines of philosophy and political theory particularly for such authors as Giorgio Agamben Roberto Esposito Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. His discussions on power and discourse have inspired many critical theorists who believe that Foucaults analysis of power structures could aid the struggle against inequality. They claim that through discourse analysis hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucaults work is linked to critical theory. His work Discipline and Punish influenced his friend and contemporary Gilles Deleuze who published the paper Postscript on the Societies of Control praising Foucaults work but arguing that contemporary western society has in fact developed from a disciplinary society into a society of control. Deleuze went on to publish a book dedicated to Foucaults thought in 1988 under the title Foucault.

Foucaults discussions of the relationship between power and knowledge has influenced postcolonial critiques in explaining the discursive formation of colonialism particularly in Edward Saids work Orientalism. Foucaults work has been compared to that of Erving Goffman by the sociologist Michael Hviid Jacobsen and Soren Kristiansen who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault. Foucaults writings particularly The History of Sexuality have also been very influential in feminist philosophy and queer theory particularly the work of the major Feminist scholar Judith Butler due to his theories regarding the genealogy of maleness and femaleness power sexuality and bodies.

A prominent critique of Foucaults thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power freedom becomes elusiveeven as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent but which relies on an implicit norm to mount the critique led philosopher Jürgen Habermas to describe Foucaults thinking as crypto-normativist covertly reliant on the very Enlightenment principles he attempts to argue against. A similar critique has been advanced by Diana Taylor and by Nancy Fraser who argues that Foucaults critique encompasses traditional moral systems he denies himself recourse to concepts such as freedom and justice and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.

The philosopher Richard Rorty has argued that Foucaults archaeology of knowledge is fundamentally negative and thus fails to adequately establish any new theory of knowledge per se. Rather Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes

As far as I can see all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity of any segment of culture as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past.

Foucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses. For example Hans-Ulrich Wehler harshly criticized Foucault in 1998. Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler Foucaults works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example Foucaults concept of power is desperatingly undifferentiated and Foucaults thesis of a disciplinary society is according to Wehler only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority force power violence and legitimacy. In addition his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also Wehler criticizes Foucaults francocentrism because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like Max Weber and Norbert Elias. In all Wehler concludes that Foucault is because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest empirically absolutely unreliable crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism.

Though American feminists have built on Foucaults critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.

The philosopher Roger Scruton argues in Sexual Desire that Foucault was incorrect to claim in The History of Sexuality that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a problematisation of the sexual did not occur concluding that No history of thought could show the problematisation of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations it is characteristic of personal experience generally and therefore of every genuine social order.

Foucaults approach to sexuality which he sees as socially constructed has become influential in queer theory. Foucaults resistance to identity politics and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of object choice stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.

Foucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of social constructionism which some see as an affront to the concept of truth. In Foucaults 1971 televised debate with Noam Chomsky Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature as posited by Chomskys concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice. Following the debate Chomsky was stricken with Foucaults total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality stating He struck me as completely amoral Id never met anyone who was so totally amoral I mean I liked him personally its just that I couldnt make sense of him. Its as if he was from a different species or something.

Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.

One of Foucaults claims regarding the subjectivity of the self has been disputed. Opposing Foucaults view of subjectivity it is possibly more reasonable to assume that other factors such as biological environmental and cultural are explanations for the self."
Simon Foucher,"Simon Foucher was a French polemicphilosopher. His philosophical standpoint was one of Academic skepticism he did not agree with dogmatism but didnt resort to Pyrrhonism either.

He was born in Dijon the son of a merchant and appears to have taken holy orders at a very early age. For some years he held the position of honorary canon at Dijon but he resigned in order to take up his residence in Paris. He graduated at the Sorbonne having studied theology and spent the remainder of his life in literary work in Paris where he died.

In his day Foucher enjoyed considerable reputation as a keen opponent of Malebranche and Leibniz. He revived the old arguments of the Academy and advanced them with much ingenuity against Malebranches doctrine. Otherwise his skepticism is subordinate to orthodox belief the fundamental dogmas of the church seeming to him intuitively evident. His object was to reconcile his religious with his philosophical creed and to remain a Christian without ceasing to be an academician.

In his 1673 publication Dissertation on the Search for Truth he brought to light peoples psychological predilection for certainties. He wrote about the art of doubtingabout positioning oneself between doubting and believing. He wrote One needs to exit doubt in order to produce sciencebut few people heed the importance of not exiting from it prematurely....It is a fact that one usually exits doubt without realizing it. He wrote further We are dogma-prone from our mothers wombs.

Foucher had the annoying habit of re-using the same titles for his works making it necessary to cite the whole subtitle in order to specify which work is being referred to.

In addition to these works Foucher published two long poems and a few shorter philosophical pieces. He also conducted an important correspondence with Leibniz and wrote but never published a play."
Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée,"Alfred Jules Émile Fouillée was a French philosopher.

Fouillée was born at La Pouëze Maine-et-Loire. He held several minor philosophical lectureships and from 1864 was professor of philosophy at the lycées of Douai Montpellier and Bordeaux successively. In 1867 and 1868 he was crowned by the Academy of Moral Science for his work on Plato and Socrates. In 1872 he was elected master of conferences at the Ecole Normale and was made doctor of philosophy in recognition of his two treatises Platonis Hippias Minor sine Socratica contra liberum arbitrium argumenta and La Liberté et le déterminisme.

The strain of the next three years continuous work undermined his health and his eyesight and he was compelled to retire from his professorship. During these years he had published works on Plato and Socrates and a history of philosophy ; but after his retirement he further developed his philosophical position a speculative eclecticism through which he endeavoured to reconcile metaphysical idealism with the naturalistic and mechanical standpoint of science.

In LEvolutionnisme des idées-forces La Psychologie des idées-forces and La Morale des idées-forces is elaborated his doctrine of idées forces or of mind as efficient cause through the tendency of ideas to realize themselves in appropriate movement. Ethical and sociological developments of this theory succeed its physical and psychological treatment the consideration of the antinomy of freedom being especially important.

Fouillées wife Augustine Fouillée who by a previous marriage was the mother of the poet and philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau is better known under the pseudonym of G Bruno as the author of the books for children including educational novel and school book Le Tour de la France par deux enfants .

Fouillée occupied the Les Colombières estate in Menton which was later remodelled by Ferdinand Bac. He died on 16 January 1912 in Lyon."
Charles Fourier,"François Marie Charles Fourier was a French philosopher an influential early socialist thinker and one of the founders of utopian socialism. Some of Fouriers social and moral views held to be radical in his lifetime have become mainstream thinking in modern society. For instance Fourier is credited with having originated the word feminism in 1837.

Fouriers social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of intentional communities. Among them in the United States were the community of Utopia Ohio; La Reunion near present-day Dallas Texas; Lake Zurich Illinois; the North American Phalanx in Red Bank New Jersey; Brook Farm in West Roxbury Massachusetts; the Community Place and Sodus Bay Phalanx in New York State; Silkville Kansas and several others. In Guise France he influenced the Familistery of Guise. Fourier later inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.

Fourier was born in Besançon France on 7 April 1772. The son of a small businessman Fourier was more interested in architecture than in his fathers trade. He wanted to become an engineer but the local military engineering school accepted only sons of noblemen. Fourier later said he was grateful that he did not pursue engineering because it would have consumed too much of his time and taken away from his true desire to help humanity.

When his father died in 1781 Fourier received two-fifths of his fathers estate valued at more than 200000 francs. This inheritance enabled Fourier to travel throughout Europe at his leisure. In 1791 he moved from Besançon to Lyon where he was employed by the merchant M. Bousquet. Fouriers travels also brought him to Paris where he worked as the head of the Office of Statistics for a few months. From 1791 to 1816 Fourier was employed in Paris Rouen Lyon Marseille and Bordeaux. As a traveling salesman and correspondence clerk his research and thought was time-limited he complained of serving the knavery of merchants and the stupefaction of deceitful and degrading duties. 

He began writing. His first book was published in 1808 but it only sold a few copies. Surprisingly after six years the book fell into the hands of Monsieur Just Muiron who eventually became Fouriers patron. Fourier produced most of his writings between 1816 and 1821. In 1822 he tried to sell his books again but with no success.

Fourier declared that concern and cooperation were the secrets of social success. He believed that a society that cooperated would see an immense improvement in their productivity levels. Workers would be recompensed for their labors according to their contribution. Fourier saw such cooperation occurring in communities he called phalanxes based upon structures called Phalanstères or grand hotels. These buildings were four-level apartment complexes where the richest had the uppermost apartments and the poorest had a ground-floor residence. Wealth was determined by ones job; jobs were assigned based on the interests and desires of the individual. There were incentives jobs people might not enjoy doing would receive higher pay. Fourier considered trade which he associated with Jews to be the source of all evil and advocated that Jews be forced to perform farm work in the phalansteries. By the end of his life Fourier advocated the return of Jews to Palestine with the assistance of the Rothschilds.John K. Roth and Richard L. Rubenstein have seen Fourier as motivated by economic and religious antisemitism rather than the racial antisemitism that would emerge later in the century.

Fourier characterized poverty as the principal cause of disorder in society and he proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and by a decent minimum for those who were not able to work. Fourier used the word civilization in a negative sense and as such Fouriers contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fouriers attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time.

For Herbert Marcuse The idea of libidinal work relations in a developed industrial society finds little support in the tradition of thought and where suchsupport is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fouriers giantsocialist utopia.

Fourier insists that this transformation requires a complete change in the social institutions distribution of the social product according to need assignment of functions according to individual faculties and inclinations constant mutation of functions short work periods and so on. But the possibility of attractive labor derives above all from the release of libidinal forces . Fourier assumes the existence of an attraction industrielle which makes for pleasurable co-operation. It is based on the attraction passionnée in the nature of man which persists despite the opposition of reason duty prejudice. This attraction passionnée tends toward three principal objectives the creation of luxury or the pleasure of the five senses; the formation of libidinal groups ; and the establishment of a harmonious order organizing these groups for work in accordance with the development of the individual passions .

He believed that there were twelve common passions which resulted in 810 types of character so the ideal phalanx would have exactly 1620 people. One day there would be six million of these loosely ruled by a world omniarch or a World Congress of Phalanxes. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of fairies who would soon cure them of their lovesickness and visitors could consult the card-index of personality types for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist Hakim Bey describes Fouriers ideas as follows 

In Fouriers system of Harmony all creative activity including industry craft agriculture etc. will arise from liberated passionthis is the famous theory of attractive labor. Fourier sexualizes work itselfthe life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling intellection activity a society of lovers wild enthusiasts.

Fourier was also a supporter of womens rights in a time period when influences like Jean-Jacques Rousseau were prevalent. Fourier believed that all important jobs should be open to women on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than closed on account of gender. He spoke of women as individuals not as half the human couple. Fourier saw that traditional marriage could potentially hurt womans rights as human beings and thus never married. Writing before the advent of the term homosexuality Fourier held that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives including same-sex sexuality and androgénité. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that affirming ones difference can actually enhance social integration.

Fouriers concern was to liberate every human individual man woman and child in two senses education and the liberation of human passion.

On education Fourier felt that civilized parents and teachers saw children as little idlers. Fourier felt that this way of thinking was wrong. He felt that children as early as age two and three were very industrious. He listed the dominant tastes in all children to include but not limited to

Fourier was deeply disturbed by the disorder of his time and wanted to stabilize the course of events which surrounded him. Fourier saw his fellow human beings living in a world full of strife chaos and disorder.

Fourier is best remembered for his writings on a new world order based on unity of action and harmonious collaboration. He is also known for certain Utopian pronouncements such as that the seas would lose their salinity and turn to lemonade and a coincidental view of climate change that the North Pole would be milder than the Mediterranean in a future phase of Perfect Harmony.

The influence of Fouriers ideas in French politics was carried forward into the 1848 Revolution and the Paris Commune by followers such as Victor Considerant.

In the movie Metropolitan one of the main characters Tom Townsend mentions I favor the socialist model developed by the 19th-century French social critic Charles Fourier."
Geneviève Fraisse,"Geneviève Fraisse is a French feminist philosopher.

She was born within Murs blancs a community founded by Emmanuel Mounier at Châtenay-Malabry. Her parents Paul Fraisse and Simone Fraisse were both professors at the Sorbonne. In May 1968 she is a first year philosophy student at the Sorbonne. She co-funded with Jacques Rancière the journal Les Révoltes logiques .

Author of around 20 books her work focuses on the political epistemology of feminist thought. Her research led her to postulate concepts on the domestic service exclusive democracy womens reason the two governments the mixing of the sexes habeas corpus and consent. The complexity of the debate on gender led her to work closely with the historians particularly on the synthesis of the history of women in the West. Seen as a leader of contemporary thought her idea of gender equality lies between theory and practice concepts and historicity.

Fraisse has been an interministerial delegate on womens rights from 1997 to 1998 and a Member of European Parliament from 1999 to 2004 as an independent member of the European United LeftNordic Green Left. She took the initiative of two parliamentary agendas one on the performing arts the other on women and sport. Geneviève Fraisse has also been a producer at France Culture .

Geneviève Fraisse joined the French National Centre for Scientific Research in 1983. She helped create the International College of Philosophy . She was Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1990. A doctor she has been director of research at CNRS since 1997 and visiting professor at Rutgers University . She was also president of the Scientific Committee of the Institut Emilie du Châtelet from 2006 to 2010. From 2011 to 2013 she gave a Master Class at Science-Po Paris Pensée des sexes et démocratie with the program PRESAGE .

Nicolas Fréret,"Nicolas Fréret was a French scholar.

He was born at Paris on 15 February 1688. His father was procureur to the parlement of Paris and destined him to the profession of the law. His first tutors were the historian Charles Rollin and Father Desmolets . Amongst his early studies history chronology and mythology held a prominent place.

To please his father he studied law and began to practise at the bar; but the force of his genius soon carried him onto his own path. At nineteen he was admitted to a society of learned men before whom he read memoirs on the religion of the Greeks on the worship of Bacchus of Ceres of Cybele and of Apollo. He was hardly twenty-six years of age when he was admitted as pupil to the Academy of Inscriptions. One of the first memoirs which he read was a learned and critical discourse Sur lorigine des Francs . He maintained that the Franks were a league of South German tribes and not according to the legend then almost universally received a nation of free men deriving from Greece or Troy who had kept their civilization intact in the heart of a barbarous country. These views excited great indignation in the Abbé Vertot who denounced Fréret to the government as a libeller of the monarchy. A lettre de cachet was issued and Fréret was sent to the Bastille.

During his three months of confinement he studied Xenophon the fruit of which appeared later in his memoir on the Cyropaedia. From the time of his liberation in March 1715 his life was uneventful. In January 1716 he was received as associate of the Academy of Inscriptions and in December 1742 he was made perpetual secretary. He worked without intermission for the interests of the Academy not even claiming any property in his own writings which were printed in the Recueil de lacademie des inscriptions.

The list of his memoirs many of them posthumous occupies four columns of the Nouvelle Biographie générale. They treat of history chronology geography mythology and religion. Throughout he appears as the keen learned and original critic; examining into the comparative value of documents distinguishing between the mythical and the historical and separating traditions with an historical element from pure fables and legends. He rejected the extreme pretensions of the chronology of Egyptian origin for the Chinese civilisation and characters and at the same time controverted the scheme of Sir Isaac Newton as too limited. He investigated the mythology not only of the Greeks but of the Celts the Germans the Chinese and the Indians. He was a vigorous opponent of the theory that the stories of mythology may be referred to historic originals. He also suggested that Greek mythology owed much to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.

He was one of the first scholars of Europe to undertake the study of the Chinese language under the guidance of Arcadio Huang a Chinese man working as translator and librarian for king Louis XIV; and in this he was engaged at the time of his committal to the Bastille. He died in Paris on 8 March 1749.

After his death several works of an atheistic character were falsely attributed to him and were long believed to be his. The most famous of these are the Examen critique des apologistes de la religion chrétienne and the Lettre de Thrasybule à Leucippe printed in London about 1768.

A very defective and inaccurate edition of Frérets works was published in 1796-1799. A new and complete edition was projected by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac but of this only the first volume appeared . It contains a life of Fréret. His manuscripts after passing through many hands were deposited in the library of the Institute. The best account of his works is Examen critique des ouvrages composes par Fréret in C. A. Walckenaers Recueil des notices c. . See also Quérards France litteraire."

In the following years Gabels works stressed the analysis of ideologies and marxist theory of alienation . Gabel also wrote the articles Utopia and Ideology in the Encyclopedia Universalis and he was one of the only French specialists on Karl Mannheim."
Jacques Gaffarel,"Jacques Gaffarel was a French scholar and astrologer. He followed the family tradition of studying medicine and then became a priest but mainly developed his interests in the fields of natural history and Oriental occultism gaining fluency in the Hebrew Persian and Arabic languages.

His most famous work is Curiositez inouyes sur la sculpture talismanique des Persans horoscope des Patriarches et lecture des estoiles which was published in French in 1629 . Gaffarel included in his work two large folding plates of the Celestial Constellations expressed by Hebrew characters and asserted that the letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be interpreted from the constellations and that the heavens could be read as if a book.

His book enjoyed phenomenal success. René Descartes read it with interest and the French physician and mathematician Pierre Gassendi defended it. Unheard-of Curiosities was one of 1500 books in the Library of Sir Thomas Browne and one of the varied sources of his encyclopaedia entitled Pseudodoxia Epidemica. Browne alludes to Gaffarels astrology in The Garden of Cyrus thus

Gaffarel contributed to the debate between Marin Mersenne and Robert Fludd.

On the other hand the Sorbonne rejected Gaffarels work and ridiculed him; however he gained the protection of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu who made him his librarian and sent him off first to Italy then to Greece and Asia to retrieve rare books .

Roger Garaudy,"Roger Garaudy was a French philosopher French resistance fighter and a communist author. He converted to Islam in 1982. In 1998 he was convicted and fined for Holocaust denial under French law for claiming that the death of six million Jews was a myth.

Roger Garaudy was born in Marseille to working class Catholic parents. At the age of 14 Garaudy converted to Protestantism. He fought during World War II and received the Croix de Guerre. After a period as a Vichy France prisoner of war in Algeria Garaudy joined the French Resistance working for resistance radio and the newspaper Liberté.

Garaudy joined the French Communist Party in 1933. By mid 1940s Garaudy was considered a leading polemicist within the party. He rose through the ranks and in 1945 he became a member of the partys leadership and its Central Executive Committee where he occupied positions for 28 years.

As a political candidate he succeeded in being elected to the National Assembly and eventually rose to the position of deputy speaker and later senator.

Garaudy remained a Christian and eventually re-converted to Catholicism during his political career. He was befriended by one of Frances most prominent clerics of the time the Abbé Pierre who in later years supported Garaudy even regarding the latters most controversial views.

Garaudy was expelled from the Communist Party in 1970 because he had criticized the partys position on the student movement and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. His philosophical and political views were characterized as revisionist by Soviet commentators. He had however accepted the invasion of Hungary in 1956.

He obtained a state doctorate in philosophy in 1953 with a dissertation discussing theory of knowledge and materialism entitled La théorie matérialiste de la connaissance. In May 1954 Garaudy defended another doctoral thesis The Problem of Freedom and Necessity in the Light of Marxism at the Institute of Philosophy Russian Academy of Sciences.

Garaudy lectured in the faculty of arts department of the University of Clermont-Ferrand from 19621965. Due to controversies between Garaudy and Michel Foucault Garaudy left. He later taught in Poitiers from 19691972.

His main research subject was foundations of revolutionary politics.

As of 1940s Garaudy was critical of Jean-Paul Sartres view of freedom maintaining that it lacks any social economic political or historical context. He criticized Being and Nothingness for what he deemed not going beyond the domain of metaphysical pathology and Sartres novels for depicting only degenerates and human wrecks and describing his existentialism as a sickness.

Garaudys faith in communism was shaken in 1956 after Nikita Khrushchev made the Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Afterwards he espoused an eclectic and humanist view on Marxism strictly opposing the theoretical Marxism of Louis Althusser and advocating dialogue with other schools of thought.

In 1974 Frederic Will described him as sympathetic towards Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Gabriel Marcel. He held that the Western culture was something of a coalition between the idealistic philosophy and the elite class which is devoted to turning man away from the material world. The goal of socialism in his view was not simply economic or providing social justice but also giving each individual their personal chances for creativity.

Around 1980 Garaudy read The Green Book by Muammar Gaddafi and became interested in Libya and Islam meeting the countrys leader on several occasions in the desert. He converted formally at the Islamic Centre in Geneva an organisation controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood.

In The Case of Israel A Study of Political Zionism Garaudy portrays Zionism as an isolationist and segregationist ideology that is not only dependent on antisemitism to nourish but also willfully encourages it to achieve its goals.

In 1996 Garaudy published with his editor Pierre Guillaume the work Les Mythes fondateurs de la politique israelienne later translated into English as The Founding Myths of Modern Israel. In the book he wrote of the myth of the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Because of this breach of French law concerning Holocaust denial the courts banned any further publication and on 27 February 1998 fined Garaudy 240000 French francs. He was sentenced to a suspended jail sentence of several years. Garaudy appealed this decision to the European Court of Human Rights but his appeal was rejected as inadmissible. At his hearing Garaudy stated that his book in no way condoned National Socialist methods and that book was an attack on the mythologizing and use of the holocaust by Israeli government as policy. He argued that his book dealt with the Israeli governments use of the holocaust as a justifying dogma for its actions mainly in Palestine and toward Palestinians.

Garaudy challenged the French ruling and appealed to the European Convention on Human Rights stating that his book was a political work criticizing the policies of Israel that did not deny that the Nazis had committed crimes against humanity and that his freedom of expression was interfered by the French courts. The ECHR disagreed and ruled that Garaudy has denied historical facts in his book which is not a research work. It also argued that the interference pursued two of the legitimate aims included in Gayssot Act articles and is not a violation of Garaudys right for free speech. The ECHR did not use this rationale in Perinçek v. Switzerland.

In Iran 160 members of the parliament and 600 journalists signed a petition in Garaudys support. On 20 April 1998 Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei met Garaudy. Khamenei was critical of the West which he said condemned the racist behavior of the Nazis while accepting the Zionists Nazi-like behavior. Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani insisted in a sermon delivered on Iranian radio that Hitler only killed 20000 Jews and not six million and that Garaudys crime derives from the doubt he cast on Zionist propaganda. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami described Garaudy in 1998 as a thinker and a believer who was brought to trial merely for publishing research which was displeasing to the West.

In December 2006 Garaudy was unable to attend the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran Iran owing to ill health. He reportedly sent a videotaped message supporting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads view that Israel should cease to exist.

Roger Garaudy died in Chennevieres Paris on Wednesday 13 June 2012 aged 98.

According to Azzam Tamimi Tunisian thinker Rached Ghannouchi was inspired by Garaudy in the early 1980s after he read a translation of his book on women. He subsequently authored a treatise on women rights and on the status of women in the Islamic movement partly influenced by Garaudys work.

The author of more than 70 books some his translated works include"
Pierre Gassendi,"Pierre Gassendi was a French philosopher Catholic priest astronomer and mathematician. While he held a church position in south-east France he also spent much time in Paris where he was a leader of a group of free-thinking intellectuals. He was also an active observational scientist publishing the first data on the transit of Mercury in 1631. The lunar crater Gassendi is named after him.

He wrote numerous philosophical works and some of the positions he worked out are considered significant finding a way between skepticism and dogmatism. Richard Popkin indicates that Gassendi was one of the first thinkers to formulate the modern scientific outlook of moderated skepticism and empiricism. He clashed with his contemporary Descartes on the possibility of certain knowledge. His best known intellectual project attempted to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity.

Gassendi was born at Champtercier near Digne in France to Antoine Gassend and Françoise Fabry. His earliest education was entrusted to his maternal uncle Thomas Fabry the curé of the church of Champtercier. A youthful prodigy at a very early age he showed academic potential and attended the collège at Digne where he displayed a particular aptitude for languages and mathematics. In 1609 he entered the University of Aix-en-Provence to study philosophy under Philibert Fesaye O.Carm. at the Collège Royal de Bourbon . In 1612 the college of Digne called him to lecture on theology. While at Digne he travelled to Senez where he received minor orders from Bishop Jacques Martin. In 1614 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Avignon and was elected Theologian in the Cathedral Chapter of Digne. On 1 August 1617 he received holy orders from Bishop Jacques Turricella of Marseille. In the same year at the age of 24 he accepted the chair of philosophy at the University of Aix-en-Provence and yielded the chair of theology to his old teacher Fesaye. Gassendi seems gradually to have withdrawn from theology. He maintained his position as Canon Theologial at Digne however and in September 1619 when Bishop Raphaël de Bologne took possession of the diocese of Digne Gassendi participated and made the speech on behalf of the Chapter.

He lectured principally on the Aristotelian philosophy conforming as far as possible to the traditional methods while he also followed with interest the discoveries of Galileo and Kepler. He came into contact with the astronomer Joseph Gaultier de la Vallette the Grand Vicar of the Archbishopric of Aix.

In 1623 the Society of Jesus took over the University of Aix. They filled all positions with Jesuits so Gassendi was required to find another institution. He left returning to Digne on 10 February 1623 and then returned to Aix to witness an eclipse of the moon on 14 April and the presence of Mars in Sagittarius on 7 June from which he returned again to Digne. He travelled to Grenoble on behalf of the Chapter of Digne for a lawsuit most reluctantly since he was working on his project on Aristotles paradoxes. In 1624 he printed the first part of his Exercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristoteleos. A fragment of the second book later appeared in print at The Hague but Gassendi never composed the remaining five apparently thinking that the Discussiones Peripateticae of Francesco Patrizzi left little scope for him.

He spent some time with his patron Nicolas Peiresc. After 1628 Gassendi travelled in Flanders and in Holland where he encountered Isaac Beeckman and François Luillier. He returned to France in 1631. In 1634 the Cathedral Chapter of Digne had become disgusted at the wasteful behavior of Provost Blaise Ausset and they voted to replace him. They obtained an arrêt of the Parliament of Aix dated 19 December 1634 which consented to his deposition and to the election of Pierre Gassendi as provost of the Cathedral Chapter. Gassendi was formally installed on 24 December 1634. He held the Provostship until his death in 1655.

During this time he wrote some works at the insistence of Marin Mersenne. They included his examination of the mystical philosophy of Robert Fludd an essay on parhelia and some observations on the transit of Mercury.

Gassendi then spent some years travelling through Provence with the duke of Angoulême governor of the region. During this period he wrote only the one literary work his Life of Peiresc whose death in 1637 seemed to afflict him deeply; it received frequent reprintings and an English translation. He returned to Paris in 1641 where he met Thomas Hobbes. He gave some informal philosophy classes gaining pupils or disciples; according to the biographer Grimarest these included Molière Cyrano de Bergerac Jean Hesnault and Claude-Emmanuel Chapelle son of Lullier.

In 1640 Mersenne engaged him in controversy with René Descartes. His objections to the fundamental propositions of Descartes appeared in print in 1641; they appear as the Fifth Set of Objections in the works of Descartes. Though Descartes is often credited with the discovery of the mind-body problem Gassendi reacting to Descartes mind-body dualism was the first to state it. Gassendis tendency towards the empirical school of speculation appears more pronounced here than in any of his other writings. Jean-Baptiste Morin attacked his De motu impresso a motore translato . In 1643 Mersenne also tried to garner support from the German Socinian and advocate of religious tolerance Marcin Ruar. Ruar replied at length that he had already read Gassendi but was in favour of leaving science to science not to the church.

In 1645 he accepted the chair of mathematics in the Collège Royal in Paris and lectured for several years with great success. In addition to controversial writings on physical questions there appeared during this period the first of the works for which historians of philosophy remember him. In 1647 he published the well-received treatise De vita moribus et doctrina Epicuri libri octo. Two years later appeared his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes Laërtius. In the same year he had published the more important commentary Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri.

In 1648 ill-health compelled him to give up his lectures at the Collège Royal. Around this time he became reconciled to Descartes after years of coldness through the good offices of César dEstrées.

He travelled in the south of France in the company of his protégé aide and secretary François Bernier another pupil from Paris. He spent nearly two years at Toulon where the climate suited him. In 1653 he returned to Paris and resumed his literary work living in the house of Montmor publishing in that year lives of Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe. The disease from which he suffered a lung complaint had however established a firm hold on him. His strength gradually failed and he died at Paris in 1655. A bronze statue of him was erected by subscription at Digne in 1852.

As part of his promotion of empirical methods and his anti-Aristotelian and anti-Cartesian views he was responsible for a number of scientific firsts

In addition to this he did work on determining longitude via eclipses of the moon and on improving the Rudolphine Tables. He addressed the issue of free fall in De motu and De proportione qua gravia decidentia accelerantur .

Edward Gibbon styled him Le meilleur philosophe des littérateurs et le meilleur littérateur des philosophes .

Henri Louis Habert de Montmor published Gassendis collected works most importantly the Syntagma philosophicum in 1658 . Nicolaus Averanius published another edition also in 6 folio volumes in 1727. The first two comprise entirely his Syntagma philosophicum; the third contains his critical writings on Epicurus Aristotle Descartes Robert Fludd and Herbert of Cherbury with some occasional pieces on certain problems of physics; the fourth his Institutio astronomica and his Commentarii de rebus celestibus; the fifth his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes Laërtius the biographies of Epicurus Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc Tycho Brahe Nicolaus Copernicus Georg von Peuerbach and Regiomontanus with some tracts on the value of ancient money on the Roman calendar and on the theory of music with an appended large and prolix piece entitled Notitia ecclesiae Diniensis; the sixth volume contains his correspondence. The Lives especially those of Copernicus Tycho and Peiresc received much praise.

The Exercitationes excited much attention though they contain little or nothing beyond what others had already advanced against Aristotle. The first book expounds clearly and with much vigour the evil effects of the blind acceptance of the Aristotelian dicta on physical and philosophical study; but as occurs with so many of the anti-Aristotelian works of this period the objections show the usual ignorance of Aristotles own writings. The second book which contains the review of Aristotles dialectic or logic throughout reflects Ramism in tone and method. One of the objections to Descartes became famous through Descartess statement of it in the appendix of objections in the Meditations.

His book Animadversiones published in 1649 contains a translation of Diogenes Laërtius Book X on Epicurus and appeared with a commentary in the form of the Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri. His labors on Epicurus have historical importance but he has been criticized for holding doctrines arguably irreconcilable with his strong expressions of empiricism.

In the book he maintains his maxim that there is nothing in the intellect which has not been in the senses but he contends that the imaginative faculty is the counterpart of sense because it involves material images and therefore is intrinsically material and that it is essentially the same both in men and brutes. However he also admits that the classic qualifier of humanity intellect which he affirms as immaterial and immortal comes to an understanding of notions and truths that no effort of sensation or imagination could have attained . He illustrates the capacity to form general notions; the conception of universality which he says brutes never are able to partake in though they utilize phantasia as truly as men; the notion of God whom he says we may imagine as corporeal but understand as incorporeal; and lastly the reflex by which the mind makes the phenomena and operations within it the objects of its attention.

The English Epicurean Walter Charleton produced an English free adaptation of this book Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charletonia in 1654.

The Syntagma philosophicum sub-divides according to the usual fashion of the Epicureans into logic physics and ethics.

The logic contains a sketch of the history of the science De origine et varietate logicae and is divided into theory of right apprehension theory of right judgment theory of right inference theory of right method . The first part contains the specially empirical positions which Gassendi afterwards neglects or leaves out of account. The senses the sole source of knowledge supposedly yield us immediate cognition of individual things; phantasy reproduces these ideas; understanding compares these ideas each particular and frames general ideas. Nevertheless he admits that the senses yield knowledgenot of thingsbut of qualities only and that we arrive at the idea of thing or substance by inductive reasoning. He holds that the true method of research is the analytic rising from lower to higher notions; yet he sees and admits that inductive reasoning as conceived by Francis Bacon rests on a general proposition not itself proved by induction. The whole doctrine of judgment syllogism and method mixes Aristotelian and Ramist notions.

In the second part of the Syntagma the physics appears the most glaring contradiction between Gassendis fundamental principles. While approving of the Epicurean physics he rejects the Epicurean negation of God and particular providence. He states the various proofs for the existence of an immaterial infinite supreme Being asserts that this Being is the author of the visible universe and strongly defends the doctrine of the foreknowledge and particular providence of God. At the same time he holds in opposition to Epicureanism the doctrine of an immaterial rational soul endowed with immortality and capable of free determination. Friedrich Albert Lange claimed that all this portion of Gassendis system contains nothing of his own opinions but is introduced solely from motives of self-defence.

The positive exposition of atomism has much that is attractive but the hypothesis of the calor vitalis a species of anima mundi which he introduces as a physical explanation of physical phenomena does not seem to throw much light on the special problems which he invokes it to solve. Nor is his theory of the weight essential to atoms as being due to an inner force impelling them to motion in any way reconcilable with his general doctrine of mechanical causes.

In the third part the ethics over and above the discussion on freedom which on the whole is indefinite there is little beyond a milder statement of the Epicurean moral code. The final end of life is happiness and happiness is harmony of soul and body . Probably Gassendi thinks perfect happiness is not attainable in this life but it may be in the life to come.

According to Gabriel Daniel Gassendi was a little Pyrrhonian in matters of science; but that was no bad thing. He wrote against the magical animism of Robert Fludd and judicial astrology. He became dissatisfied with the Peripatetic system the orthodox approach to natural philosophy based on the writings of Aristotle. Gassendi shared the empirical tendencies of the age. He contributed to the objections against Aristotelian philosophy but waited to publish his own thoughts.

There remains some controversy as to the extent to which Gassendi subscribed to the so-called libertinage érudit the learned free-thinking that characterised the Tétrade the Parisian circle to which he belonged along with Gabriel Naudé and two others . Gassendi at least belonged to the fideist wing of the sceptics arguing that the absence of certain knowledge implied the room for faith.

In his dispute with Descartes he did apparently hold that the evidence of the senses remains the only convincing evidence; yet he maintains as is natural from his mathematical training that the evidence of reason is absolutely satisfactory.

Samuel Sorbière a disciple recounts Gassendis life in the first collected edition of the works by Joseph Bougerel Vie de Gassendi ; as does Jean Philibert Damiron Mémoire sur Gassendi . An abridgment of his philosophy was given by his friend the celebrated traveller François Bernier ."
Marcel Gauchet,"Marcel Gauchet is a French historian philosopher and sociologist. He is professor emeritus of the Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales and head of the periodical Le Débat.

Gauchet is one of Frances most prominent contemporary intellectuals. He has written widely on such issues as the political consequences of modern individualism the relation between religion and democracy and the dilemmas of globalisation.

Two of Gauchets books have been translated into English including The Disenchantment of the World A Political History of Religion.

Gauchet was awarded the Prix européen de lessai fondation Charles Veillon in 2018."
Jules de Gaultier,Jules de Gaultier born Jules Achille de Gaultier de Laguionie was a French philosopher and essayist. He was a contributor to Mercure de France and one of the chief advocates of nietzscheism in vogue in the literary circles of the day. He was known especially for his theory of bovarysme by which he meant the continual need of humans to invent themselves to lie to themselves. His books include De Kant à Nietzsche and Le Bovarysme essai sur le pouvoir dimaginer .
Étienne Gilson,"Born in Paris into a Roman Catholic family originally from Burgundy Gilson attended the minor seminary at Notre-Dame-des-Champs then finished his secondary education at the Lycée Henri IV. After finishing his military service during which he began to read René Descartes he studied for his licence focusing on the influence of scholasticism on Cartesian thought. After studying at the Sorbonne under Victor Delbos and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl and at the Collège de France under Henri Bergson he finished his degree in Philosophy in 1906. In 1908 he married Thérèse Ravisé of Melun and he taught in the high schools of Bourg-en-Bresse Rochefort Tours Saint-Quentin and Angers.

In 1913 while employed in teaching at the University of Lille he defended his doctoral dissertation at the University of Paris on Liberty in Descartes and Theology. His career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I as he was drafted into the French Army as a sergeant. He served on the front and took part in the battle of Verdun as second lieutenant. He was captured in February 1916 and spent two years in captivity. During this time he devoted himself to new areas of study including the Russian language and St. Bonaventure. He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery in action.

In 1919 he became professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. From 1921 to 1932 he taught the history of medieval philosophy at the University of Paris. As an internationally renowned thinker Gilson was first along with Jacques Maritain to receive an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1930.

He also taught for three years at Harvard. At the invitation of the Congregation of St. Basil he set up the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto in conjunction with St. Michaels College at the University of Toronto which hosts an annual Étienne Gilson Lecture. He was elected to the Académie française in 1946.

With the death of his wife Thérèse Ravisé on 12 November 1949 Gilson endured a considerable emotional shock.

In 1951 he relinquished his chair to Martial Gueroult at the Collège de France to devote himself completely to the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies until 1968. He knew the Jesuit theologian and cardinal Henri de Lubac. Their correspondence has been published. Although Gilson was primarily a historian of philosophy he was also at the forefront of the 20th century revival of Thomism along with Jacques Maritain. His work has received critical praise from Richard McKeon.

Gilson undertook to analyze Thomism from a historical perspective. To Gilson Thomism is certainly not identical with scholasticism in the pejorative sense but indeed rather a revolt against it. Gilson considered the philosophy of his own era to be deteriorating into a science which would signal humanitys abdication of the right to judge and rule nature humanity made a mere part of nature which in turn would give the green light for the most reckless of social adventures to play havoc with human lives and institutions. Against systems of philosophy Gilson was convinced that it was the revival of the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas that opens the way out of that danger zone.

In his time Gilson was the leading scholar of the history of medieval philosophy as well as a highly regarded philosopher in his own right.

Gilsons Painting and Reality was also published in English."
René Girard,"René Noël Théophile Girard was a French polymath historian literary critic and philosopher of social science whose work belongs to the tradition of anthropological philosophy. Girard was the author of nearly thirty books with his writings spanning many academic domains. Although the reception of his work is different in each of these areas there is a growing body of secondary literature on his work and his influence on disciplines such as literary criticism critical theory anthropology theology psychology mythology sociology economics cultural studies and philosophy.

Girards main contribution to philosophy and in turn to other disciplines was in the field of epistemological and ethical systems of desire. Girard believed that human development occurs initially through a process of observational mimicry where the infant develops desire through a process of learning to copy adult behaviour fundamentally linking acquisition of identity knowledge and material wealth to the development of a desire to have something others possess.

All conflict competition and rivalry therefore originate in mimetic desire which eventually reaches destructive stages of conflict both between individuals and social groups that requires them to blame someone or something in order to defuse conflict through the scapegoat mechanism. Unable to assume responsibility or engage in self-reflection to recognize their own part in the conflict humans individually and cross-tribally unite to defuse conflict by murdering the king or whoever appears to have the least support in the conflict and then recognizing when the person has died how much less stress they have and the unification leads to them eventually thinking of the deposed dead king as a god i.e. deification or sanctification. Or guilt is ascribed to an innocent third-party whose murder permits the creation of a common unifying mythological underlay necessary for the foundation of human culture.

For Girard religion and mythology were therefore necessary steps in human evolution to control the violence that arises from mimetic rivalry and unequal distribution of desirable things. Religion directed the scapegoat impulse on imaginary concepts such as Satan or demons the absence of which would see an increase in human conflict according to Girard. His ideas ran sharply contrary to the post-modernism in vogue through most of his life and his views of human nature were pessimistic in contrast with the mainstream currents of his time. Girard saw religion as an essential instrument of cohesion believing that the primary purpose of sacred texts was to end the practice of human sacrifice through ritualistically surrogating for the behaviour triggered by scapegoat mechanism adopting and expanding many of Nietzsches ideas.

Girard was born in Avignon on 25 December 1923. He studied medieval history at the École des Chartes Paris where the subject of his thesis was Private life in Avignon in the second half of the fifteenth century .

In 1947 Girard went to Indiana University on a one-year fellowship. He was to spend most of his career in the United States. He received his PhD in 1950 and stayed at Indiana University until 1953. The subject of his PhD at Indiana University was American Opinion of France 19401943. Although his research was in history he was also assigned to teach French literature the field in which he would first make his reputation as a literary critic by publishing influential essays on such authors as Albert Camus and Marcel Proust.

Girard occupied positions at Duke University and Bryn Mawr College from 1953 to 1957 after which he moved to Johns Hopkins University Baltimore where he became a full professor in 1961. In that year he also published his first book Mensonge romantique et vérité romanesque . For several years he moved back and forth between the State University of New York at Buffalo and Johns Hopkins University. Books he published in this period include La Violence et le sacré and Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde .

In 1981 Girard became Andrew B. Hammond Professor of French Language Literature and Civilization at Stanford University where he stayed until his retirement in 1995. During this period he published Le Bouc émissaire La route antique des hommes pervers A Theatre of Envy William Shakespeare and Quand ces choses commenceront ... .

In 1985 he received his first honorary degree from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands; several others followed.

In 1990 a group of scholars founded the Colloquium on Violence and Religion with a goal to explore criticize and develop the mimetic model of the relationship between violence and religion in the genesis and maintenance of culture. This organization organizes a yearly conference devoted to topics related to mimetic theory scapegoating violence and religion. Girard was Honorary Chair of COVR. Co-founder and first president of the COVR was the Roman Catholic theologian Raymund Schwager.

René Girards work has inspired interdisciplinary research projects and experimental research such as the Mimetic Theory project sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation.

On 17 March 2005 Girard was elected to the Académie française.

On 4 November 2015 he died at his residence in Stanford California following a long illness.

After almost a decade of teaching French literature in the United States Girard began to develop a new way of speaking about literary texts. Beyond the uniqueness of individual works he looked for their common structural properties having observed that characters in great fiction evolved in a system of relationships otherwise common to the wider generality of novels. But there was a distinction to be made

So there did indeed exist psychological laws as Proust calls them. These laws and this system are the consequences of a fundamental reality grasped by the novelists which Girard called mimetic desire the mimetic character of desire. This is the content of his first book Deceit Desire and the Novel . We borrow our desires from others. Far from being autonomous our desire for a certain object is always provoked by the desire of another personthe modelfor this same object. This means that the relationship between the subject and the object what Girard calls the mediator is not direct but unrolls within a triangular relationship of subject model and object. Through the object one is drawn to the model.In fact it is the model the mediator who is sought. This search is called mediation.

Girard calls desire metaphysical in the measure that as soon as a desire is something more than a simple need or appetite all desire is a desire to be it is an aspiration the dream of a fullness attributed to the mediator.

Mediation is called external when the mediator of the desire is socially beyond the reach of the subject or for example a fictional character as in the case of Amadis de Gaula and Don Quixote. The hero lives a kind of folly that nonetheless remains optimistic. 

Mediation is called internal when the mediator is at the same level as the subject. The mediator then transforms into a rival and an obstacle to the acquisition of the object whose value increases as rivalry grows. This is the universe of the novels of Stendhal Flaubert Proust and Dostoevsky which are particularly studied in this book.

Through their characters our own behaviour is displayed. Everyone holds firmly to the illusion of the authenticity of ones own desires; the novelists implacably expose all the diversity of lies dissimulations maneuvers and the snobbery of the Proustian heroes; these are all but tricks of desire which prevent one from facing the truth envy and jealousy. These characters desiring the being of the mediator project upon him superhuman virtues while at the same time depreciating themselves making him a god while making themselves slaves in the measure that the mediator is an obstacle to them. Some pursuing this logic come to seek the failures that are the signs of the proximity of the ideal to which they aspire. This can manifest as a heightened experience of the universal pseudo-masochism inherent in seeking the unattainable which can of course turn into sadism should the actor play this part in reverse.

This fundamental focus on mimetic desire would be pursued by Girard throughout the rest of his career. The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts using the case study of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girards theory. He posits that intensified conflict is a product of the imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians entitling them Siamese twins.

The idea that desire to possess endless material wealth was harmful to society was not new. From the New Testament verses about the love of money being the root of all kinds of evil to Hegelian and Marxist critique that saw material wealth and capital as the mechanism of alienation of the human being both from their own humanity and their community to Bertrand Russells famous speech on accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950 desire has been understood as a destructive force in all of literature - with the theft of Helen by Paris a frequent topic of discussion by Girard.

What Girard contributed to this concept is the idea that what is desired fundamentally is not the object itself but the ontological state of the subject which possesses it where mimicry is the aim of the competition. What Paris wanted then was not Helen but to be a great king like Agamemnon. 

This was and remains a pessimistic view of human life as it posits a paradox in the very act of seeking to unify and have peace since the erasure of differences between people through mimicry is what creates conflict not the differentiation itself.

Since the mimetic rivalry that develops from the struggle for the possession of the objects is contagious it leads to the threat of violence. Girard himself says If there is a normal order in societies it must be the fruit of an anterior crisis. Turning his interest towards the anthropological domain Girard began to study anthropological literature and proposed his second great hypothesis the scapegoat mechanism which is at the origin of archaic religion and which he sets forth in his second book Violence and the Sacred a work on fundamental anthropology.

If two individuals desire the same thing there will soon be a third then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At this stage of the crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each others desires for an object but each others antagonism. They wanted to share the same object but now they want to destroy the same enemy. 

So a paroxysm of violence will then focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would mimetically grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim will reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. 

Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion that is ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event of myth as an account of this event of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually over the course of the repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.

Explorers and anthropologists have never been able to witness or bring true evidence for events similar to these which go back to the earliest times. Yet indirect evidence can be found such as the universality of ritual sacrifice and the innumerable myths that have been collected from the most varied peoples. Iff Girards theory is true then we will find in myths the culpability of the victim-god depictions of the selection of the victim and his power to beget the order that governs the group. 

Girard found these elements in numerous myths beginning with that of Oedipus which he analyzed in this and later books. On this question he opposes Claude Lévi-Strauss.

The phrase scapegoat mechanism was not coined by Girard himself; it had been used earlier by Kenneth Burke in Permanence and Change and A Grammar of Motives . However Girard took this concept from Burke and developed it much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture.

In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World Girard develops the implications of this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world the principle that explains the humanization of primates. 

It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.

The social position of king for instance begins as the victim of the scapegoat mechanism though his sacrifice is deferred and he becomes responsible for the wellbeing of the whole society.

According to Girard just as the theory of natural selection of species is the rational principle that explains the immense diversity of forms of life the victimization process is the rational principle that explains the origin of the infinite diversity of cultural forms. 

The analogy with Charles Darwin also extends to the scientific status of the theory as each of these presents itself as a hypothesis that is not capable of being proven experimentally given the extreme amounts of time necessary for the production of the phenomena in question but which imposes itself by its great explanatory power.

According to Girard the origin of language is also related to scapegoating. After the first victim after the murder of the first scapegoat there were the first prohibitions and rituals but these came into being before representation and language hence before culture. And that means that people will not start fighting again. Girard says

According to Girard the substitution of an immolated victim for the first is the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids. Girard also says this is the first time that one thing represents another thing standing in the place of this one. 

This substitution is the beginning of representation and language and also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from how should I say from instinctive ritualization instinctive prohibition instinctive separation of the antagonists which you already find to a certain extent in animals towards representation.

Unlike Eric Gans Girard does not think that there is an original scene during which there is a sudden shift from non-representation to representation or a sudden shift from animality to humanity. 

According to the French sociologist Camille Tarot it is hard to understand how the process of representation actually occurs and he has called this a black box in Girards theory.

The first stages of this interaction must occur prior to language but they must include forms of sacrifice and prohibition that create a space of non-violence around the mother and the children which make it possible to reach still higher stages of human development. You can postulate as many such stages as are needed. 

In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World Girard discusses for the first time Christianity and the Bible. The Gospels ostensibly present themselves as a typical mythical account with a victim-God lynched by a unanimous crowd an event that is then commemorated by Christians through ritual sacrifice a material re-presentation in this case in the Eucharist. The parallel is perfect except for one detail the truth of the innocence of the Victim is proclaimed by the text and the writer. 

The mythical account is usually built on the lie of the guilt of the victim in as much as it is an account of the event seen from the viewpoint of the anonymous lynchers. This ignorance is indispensable to the efficacy of the sacrificial violence.

The evangelic good news clearly affirms the innocence of the victim thus becoming by attacking ignorance the germ of the destruction of the sacrificial order on which the equilibrium of societies rests. Already the Old Testament shows this turning inside-out of the mythic accounts with regard to the innocence of the victims and the Hebrews were conscious of the uniqueness of their religious tradition. 

That he was cut off from out of the land of the living

In the Gospels the things hidden since the foundation of the world are unveiled with full clarity the foundation of social order on murder described in all its repulsive ugliness in the account of the Passion.

This revelation is even clearer because the whole text is a work on desire and violence from the desire of Eve in paradise to the prodigious strength of the mimetism that brings about the denial of Peter Pesach . 

Girard reinterprets certain biblical expressions in light of his theories; for instance he sees scandal as signifying mimetic rivalry as in Peters denial of Jesus. No one escapes responsibility neither the envious nor the envied Woe to the man through whom scandal comes .

The evangelical revelation contains the truth on the violence available for two thousand years Girard tells us. Has it put an end to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text No he replies since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.

Does the retreat of the sacrificial order mean less violence Not at all; rather it deprives modern societies of most of the capacity of sacrificial violence to establish temporary order. The innocence of the time of the ignorance is no more. On the other hand Christianity following the example of Judaism has desacralized the world making possible a utilitarian relationship with nature. Increasingly threatened by the resurgence of mimetic crises on a grand scale the contemporary world is on one hand more quickly caught up by its guilt and on the other hand has developed such a great technical power of destruction that it is condemned to both more and more responsibility and less and less innocence. So for example while empathy for victims manifests progress in the moral conscience of society it nonetheless also takes the form of a competition among victims that threatens an escalation of violence. Girard is critical of the optimism of humanist observers who believe in the natural goodness of man and the progressive improvement of his historical conditions . Rather the current nuclear stalemate between the great powers reveals that mans capacity for violence is greater than ever before and peace is only a product of this possibility to unleash apocalyptic destruction.

Jean-Michel Oughourlian in his book A mime named desire has used Girards theories in psychopathology. Hysteria and obsession are explained through mimetic rivalry and the priority of desire.

Girards work is also attracting increasing interest from empirical researchers investigating human imitation . Recently empirical studies into the mechanism of desire have suggested some intriguing correlations with Girards theory on the subject. For instance clinical psychologist Scott R. Garrels wrote

The mimetic theory has also been applied in the study of economics most notably in La violence de la monnaie by Michel Aglietta and André Orléan. Orléan was also a contributor to the volume René Girard in Les cahiers de lHerne . According to the philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg

In an interview with the Unesco Courier anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach explains that Aglietta and Orléan see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams you offer them to him today and it is up to him to do the same for you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift he is obliged to make a return gift. Now you have set in motion a positive circularity. Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating a second stage of developmenteconomic rationalityis required this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice obligations of vengeance by the gift and finally the possibly dangerous gift by economic rationality. This rationality however creates new victims as globalization is increasingly revealing.

Girards influence extends beyond philosophy and social science and includes the literary realm. A prominent example of a fiction writer influenced by Girard is J. M. Coetzee winner of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Critics have noted that mimetic desire and scapegoating are recurring themes in Coetzees novels Elizabeth Costello and Disgrace. In the latter work the books protagonist also gives a speech about the history of scapegoating with noticeable similarities to Girards view of the same subject. Coetzee has also frequently cited Girard in his non-fiction essays on subjects ranging from advertising to the Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

Theologians who describe themselves as indebted to Girard include James Alison Raymund Schwager and Bishop Robert Barron 

Some critics have pointed out that while Girard may be the first to have suggested that all desire is mimetic he is by no means the first to have noticed that some desire is mimetic Gabriel Tardes book Les lois de limitation appeared in 1890. Building on Tarde crowd psychology Nietzsche and more generally on a modernist tradition of the mimetic unconscious that had hypnosis as its via regia Nidesh Lawtoo argued that for the modernists not only desire but all affects turn out to be contagious and mimetic. René Pommier mentions La Rochefoucauld a seventeenth-century thinker who already wrote that Nothing is so infectious as example and that There are some who never would have loved if they never had heard it spoken of.

Stéphane Vinolo sees Baruch Spinoza and Thomas Hobbes as important precursors. Hobbes if any two men desire the same thing which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy they become enemies. Spinoza By the very fact that we conceive a thing which is like ourselves and which we have not regarded with any emotion to be affected with any emotion we are ourselves affected with a like emotion. Proof If we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion.

Wolfgang Palaver adds Alexis de Tocqueville to the list. Two hundred years after Hobbes the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville mentioned the dangers coming along with equality too. Like Hobbes he refers to the increase of mimetic desire coming along with equality. Palaver has in mind passages like this one from Tocquevilles Democracy in America They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way but they have opened the door to universal competition; the barrier has changed its shape rather than its position.

Maurizio Meloni highlights the similarities between Girard Jacques Lacan and Sigmund Freud. Meloni claims that these similarities arise because the projects undertaken by the three mennamely to understand the role of mythology in structuring the human psyche and culturewere very similar. What is more both Girard and Lacan read these myths through the lens of structural anthropology so it is not surprising that their intellectual systems came to resemble one another so strongly. Meloni writes that Girard and Lacan were moved by similar preoccupations and are fascinated by and attracted to the same kind of issues the constituent character of the other in the structure of desire the role of jealousy and rivalry in the construction of the social bond the proliferation of triangles within apparently dual relations doubles and mirrors imitation and the Imaginary and the crisis of modern society within which the rite of Oedipus is situated.

At times Girard acknowledges his indebtedness to such precursors including Tocqueville. At other times however Girard makes stronger claims to originality as when he says that mimetic rivalry is responsible for the frequency and intensity of human conflicts but strangely no one ever speaks of it.

Girard has presented his view as being scientifically grounded Our theory should be approached then as one approaches any scientific hypothesis. René Pommier has written a book about Girard with the ironic title Girard Ablaze Rather Than Enlightened in which he asserts that Girards readings of myths and Bible storiesthe basis of some of his most important claimsare often tendentious. Girard notes for example that the disciples actively turn against Jesus. Since Peter warms himself by a fire and fires always create community and communities breed mimetic desire this means that Peter becomes actively hostile to Jesus seeking his death. According to Pommier Girard claims that the Gospels present the Crucifixion as a purely human affair with no indication of Christ dying for the sins of mankind a claim contradicted by Mark 1045 and Matthew 2028.

The same goes for readings of literary texts says Pommier. For example Molières Don Juan only pursues one love object for mediated reasons not all of them as Girard claims. Or again Sancho Panza wants an island not because he is catching the bug of romanticism from Don Quixote but because he has been promised one. And Pavel Pavlovitch in Dostoevskys Eternal Husband has been married for ten years before Veltchaninov becomes his rival so Veltchaninov is not in fact essential to Pavels desire.

Accordingly a number of scholars have suggested that Girards writings are metaphysics rather than science. Theorist of history Hayden White did so in an article titled Ethnological Lie and Mystical Truth; Belgian anthropologist Luc de Heusch made a similar claim in his piece LEvangile selon Saint-Girard ; and Jean Greisch sees Girards thought as more or less a kind of Gnosis.

René Pommier has pointed out a number of problems with the Girardian claim that all desire is mimetic. First it is very hard to explain the existence of taboo desires such as homosexuality in repressive societies on that basis. In Girards defence on the other hand Jean-Michel Oughourlian exemplifies the situation by noting that one homosexual admitted to me that he just wanted to be somebody else.

Second every situation presents large numbers of potential mediators which means that the individual has to make a choice among them; either authentic choice is possible then or else the theory leads to a regress. Third Girard leaves no room for innovation Surely somebody has to be the first to desire a new object even if everyone else follows that trend-setter.

One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow which Girard clearly affirms. However original sin according to Girards interpretation explains only our propensity to imitate not the specific content of our imitated desires. Thus the doctrine of original sin does not solve the problem of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.

In the early part of Girards career there seemed no place for beneficial imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I dont believe that I am the other I dont want to take his place. This imitation can lead me to become sensitive to social and political problems. Rebecca Adams argued that because Girards theories fixated on violence he was creating a scapegoat himself with his own theory the scapegoat of positive mimesis. Adams proposed a reassessment of Girards theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or as she preferred to call it creative mimesis.

More recently Girard has made room for positive imitation. But as Adams implies it is not clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture. If beneficial imitation is possible then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; they could just as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges laughter and other gay forms of sovereign communication in the formation of community.

Various anthropologists have contested Girards claims. Elizabeth Traube for example reminds us that there are other ways of making sense of the data that Girard borrows from Evans-Pritchard and companyways that are more consistent with the practices of the given culture. By applying a one-size-fits-all approach Girard loses the ability to tell us anything about cultural products themselves for the simple reason that he has annihilated the cultures which produced them.

One of the main sources of criticism of Girards work comes from intellectuals who claim that his comparison of Judeo-Christian texts vis-à-vis other religions leaves something to be desired. There are also those who find the interpretation of the Christ eventas a purely human event having nothing to do with redemption from sinan unconvincing one given what the Gospels themselves say. Yet Roger Scruton notes Girards account has a divine Jesus that Jesus was the first scapegoat to understand the need for his death and to forgive those who inflicted it Girard argues Jesus gave the best evidence of his divine nature.

René Girard was the second son of Joseph Girard. Renes wife Martha née McCullough was American; they were married from 1952 until his death. They had two sons Martin Girard and Daniel Girard and a daughter Mary Brown-Girard .

Girard converted to the Catholic Church. Prior to publishing his first book Girard was a self-declared agnostic. However after embracing Catholicism Girard has been a committed and practicing Roman Catholic.

André Glucksmann,"André Glucksmann was a French philosopher activist and writer. He was a leading figure of the new philosophers.

Glucksmann began his career as a Marxist but went on to reject communism in the popular book La Cuisinière et le Mangeur dHommes and later became an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russian foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of human rights. In later years he opposed the claim that Islamic terrorism is the product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West.

André Glucksmann was born in 1937 in Boulogne-Billancourt the son of Ashkenazi Jewish parents from Austria-Hungary. His father was from Bukovina which later became part of Romania and his mother from Prague which later became the capital of Czechoslovakia.

Glucksmanns father was killed in World War II and his mother and sister were active in the French Resistance. The family narrowly escaped deportation to the camps during the Holocaust which influenced Glucksmanns developing ideas of the state as the ultimate source of barbarism.

He studied at the Lycée la Martinière in Lyon and later enrolled at École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud. His first book Le Discours de la Guerre was published in 1968.

In 1975 he published the anti-Marxist book La Cuisinière et le Mangeur dHommes - subtitled Réflexions sur lÉtat le marxisme et les camps de concentration in which he argued that Marxism leads inevitably to totalitarianism tracing parallels between the crimes of Nazism and Communism. In his next book Les maitres penseurs published in 1977 and translated into English as Master Thinkers he traced the intellectual justification for totalitarianism back to the ideas articulated by various German philosophers such as Fichte Hegel Marx and Nietzsche. In the years of the Vietnam War Glucksmann rose to national prominence after expressing his support for Vietnamese boat people. He began working with Bernard-Henri Lévy criticizing Communism. Both had formerly been well known Marxists. Shortly afterwards they became known along with others of their generation who rejected Marxism as New Philosophers a term coined by Lévy.

In 1985 Glucksmann signed a petition to President Reagan urging him to continue his support for the Contras in Nicaragua. After the fall of the Berlin Wall Glucksmann became an advocate for the use of nuclear power. In 1995 he supported the resumption of nuclear tests by Jacques Chirac. He supported the NATO intervention in Serbia in 1999. He also called for Chechnya to become independent.

In his book Dostoyevsky in Manhattan Glucksmann asserts that nihilism particularly as depicted by Dostoyevsky in his novels Demons and The Brothers Karamazov is the characteristic form of modern terrorism. Drawing on Ivan Karamazovs dictum that If there is no God everything is permitted Glucksmann argues that

The inner nature of nihilistic terrorism is that everything is permissible whether because God exists and I am his representative or because God does not exist and I take his place.

His 2006 book Une rage denfant is an autobiography which talks about how his experiences as a young Jew in occupied France led to his interest in philosophy and his belief in the importance of intervention

My style of thinking is to compare what happens on the TV in the news and so on and then extract what I can from books of philosophers to understand it. Philosophy for me is like subtitles. The problem comes from current events but the answer is supplied by philosophy.

Glucksmann criticises the notion that Islamic terrorism is a product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West arguing that the first victims of Islamic terrorism are Muslims

Why do the 200000 slaughtered Muslims of Darfur not arouse even half a quarter of the fury caused by 200-times fewer dead in Lebanon Must we deduce that Muslims killed by other Muslims dont count whether in the eyes of Muslim authorities or viewed through the bad conscience of the West

Glucksmann supported military action by the West in Afghanistan and Iraq and was highly critical of Russian foreign policy supporting for example Chechen independence. However he was against the Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence from Georgia arguing that Georgia is essential to maintaining European Union energy independence vis-a-vis Russia through access to oil and gas reserves in the former Soviet republics If Tbilisi falls there will be no way to get around Gazprom and guarantee autonomous access to the gas and petroleum wealth of Azerbaijan Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

As proof of Russias plans to use energy blackmail Glucksmann referenced a biting anti-Gazprom satirical song performed at the annual satirical award show Silver Rubber Boot which made jokes like If the Eurovision Song Contest denies victory to Russia again we are going to drive to their concert and block their gas with our bodies Glucksmann cited this as evidence that the Russian people want to cut off gas to Ukraine and Europe. He wrote

Consider a popular song performed by a military choir in Moscow. Its chorus depicts the radiant future that Gazprom is preparing Europe has a problem with us We will cut off its gas... The Russian public loves the song.

Glucksmann supported Nicolas Sarkozy for the AprilMay 2007 presidential election.

In August 2008 he co-signed an open letter with Václav Havel Desmond Tutu and Wei Jingsheng calling upon the Chinese authorities to respect human rights both during and after the Beijing Olympic Games.

He was a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

Glucksmann died in Paris on 10 November 2015 at the age of 78.

In reaction to his death President François Hollande said that Glucksmann always listened to the suffering of peoples. Former president and opposition leader Nicolas Sarkozy commented on Glucksmanns death by saying turned a page in French thought from the second half of the 20th Century.

Note Many of his works were translated into German by his long-term colleague Helmut Kohlenberger."
Arthur de Gobineau,"Joseph Arthur de Gobineau was a French aristocrat who is best known for helping to legitimise racism by the use of scientific racist theory and racial demography and for developing the theory of the Aryan master race. Known to his contemporaries as a novelist diplomat and travel writer he was an elitist who in the immediate aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848 wrote An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. In it he argued aristocrats were superior to commoners and that aristocrats possessed more Aryan genetic traits because of less interbreeding with inferior races.

Gobineaus writings were quickly praised by white supremacist pro-slavery Americans like Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze who translated his book into English. They omitted around 1000 pages of the original book including those parts that negatively described Americans as a racially mixed population. Inspiring a social movement in Germany named Gobinism his works were also influential on prominent antisemites like Richard Wagner Wagners son-in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain the Romanian politician Professor A. C. Cuza and leaders of the Nazi Party who later edited and re-published his work.

Gobineau came from an old well-established aristocratic family. His father Louis de Gobineau was a military officer and staunch royalist. His mother Anne-Louise Magdeleine de Gercy was the daughter of a non-noble royal tax official. The de Gercy family lived in the French Crown colony of Saint-Domingue for a time in the 18th century. Gobineau always feared he might have black ancestors on his mothers side.

Reflecting his hatred of the French Revolution Gobineau later wrote My birthday is July 14th the date on which the Bastille was captured-which goes to prove how opposites may come together. As a boy and young man Gobineau loved the Middle Ages which he saw as a golden age of chivalry and knighthood much preferable to his own time. Someone who knew Gobineau as a teenager described him as a romantic with chivalrous ideas and a heroic spirit dreaming of what was most noble and most grand.

Gobineaus father was committed to restoring the House of Bourbon and helped the royalist Polignac brothers to escape from France. As punishment he was imprisoned by Napoleons secret police but was freed when the Allies took Paris in 1814. During the Hundred Days the de Gobineau family fled France. After Napoleons final overthrow following the Battle of Waterloo Louis de Gobineau was rewarded for his loyalty to the House of Bourbon by being made a captain in the Royal Guard of King Louis XVIII. The pay for a Royal Guardsman was very low and the de Gobineau family struggled on his salary.

Magdeleine de Gobineau abandoned her husband for her childrens tutor Charles de La Coindière. Together with her lover she took her son and two daughters on extended wanderings across eastern France Switzerland and the Grand Duchy of Baden. To support herself she turned to fraud . His mother became a severe embarrassment to Gobineau who never spoke to her after he turned twenty.

For the young de Gobineau committed to upholding traditional aristocratic and Catholic values the disintegration of his parents marriage his mothers open relationship with her lover her fraudulent acts and the turmoil imposed by being constantly on the run and living in poverty were all very traumatic.

Gobineau spent the early part of his teenage years in the town of Inzligen where his mother and her lover were staying. He became fluent in German. As a staunch supporter of the House of Bourbon his father was forced to retire from the Royal Guard after the July Revolution of 1830 brought House of Orléans King Louis-Philippe Le roi citoyen to power. He promised to reconcile the heritage of the French Revolution with the monarchy. Given his familys history of supporting the Bourbons the young Gobineau regarded the July Revolution as a disaster for France. His views were those of a Legitimist committed to a Catholic France ruled over by the House of Bourbon. In 1831 de Gobineaus father took custody of his three children and his son spent the rest of his adolescence in Lorient in Brittany.

Gobineau disliked his father whom he dismissed as a boring and pedantic army officer incapable of stimulating thought. Lorient had been founded in 1675 as a base for the French East India Company as King Louis XIV had grand ambitions for making France the dominant political and economic power in Asia. As those ambitions were unrealized Gobineau developed a sense of faded glory as he grew up in a city that had been built to be the dominant hub for Europes trade with Asia. This dream went unrealized as India became part of the British and not the French empire.

As a young man Gobineau was fascinated with the Orient as the Middle East was known in Europe in the 19th century. While studying at the Collège de Bironne in Switzerland a fellow student recalled All of his aspirations were towards the East. He dreamt only of mosques and minarets; he called himself a Muslim ready to make the pilgrimage to Mecca. Gobineau loved Oriental tales by the French translator Antoine Galland often saying he wanted to become an Orientalist. He read Arab Turkish and Persian tales in translation becoming what the French call a un orientaliste de pacotille . In 1835 Gobineau failed the entrance exams to the St. Cyr military school.

In September 1835 Gobineau left for Paris with fifty francs in his pocket aiming to become a writer. He moved in with an uncle Thibaut-Joseph de Gobineau a Legitimist with an unlimited hatred of Louis-Philippe. Reflecting his tendency towards elitism Gobineau founded a society of Legitimist intellectuals called Les Scelti which included himself the painter Guermann John and the writer Maxime du Camp.

In the later years of the July Monarchy Gobineau made his living writing serialized fiction and contributing to reactionary periodicals. He wrote for the Union Catholique La Quotidienne LUnité and Revue de Paris. At one point in the early 1840s Gobineau was writing an article every day for La Quotidienne to support himself. As a writer and journalist he struggled financially and was forever looking for a wealthy patron willing to support him. As a part-time employee of the Post Office and a full-time writer Gobineau was desperately poor.

His family background made him a supporter of the House of Bourbon but the nature of the Legitimist movement dominated by factious and inept leaders drove Gobineau to despair leading him to write We are lost and had better resign ourselves to the fact. In a letter to his father Gobineau complained of the laxity the weakness the foolishness andin a wordthe pure folly of my cherished party.

At the same time he regarded French society under the House of Orléans as corrupt and self-serving dominated by the oppressive feudalism of money as opposed to the feudalism of charity courage virtue and intelligence held by the ancien-régime nobility. Gobineau wrote about July Monarchy France Money has become the principle of power and honour. Money dominates business; money regulates the population; money governs; money salves consciences; money is the criterion for judging the esteem due to men.

Our poor country lies in Roman decadence. Where there is no longer an aristocracy worthy of itself a nation dies. Our Nobles are conceited fools and cowards. I no longer believe in anything nor have any views. From Louis-Philippe we shall proceed to the first trimmer who will take us up but only in order to pass us on to another. For we are without fibre and moral energy. Money has killed everything.

Gobineau struck up a friendship and had voluminous correspondence with Alexis de Tocqueville. Tocqueville praised Gobineau in a letter You have wide knowledge much intelligence and the best of manners. He later gave Gobineau an appointment in the Quai dOrsay while serving as foreign minister during the Second Republic of France.

In 1841 Gobineau scored his first major success when an article he submitted to Revue des deux Mondes was published on 15 April 1841. Gobineaus article was about the Greek statesman Count Ioannis Kapodistrias. At the time La Revue des Deux Mondes was one of the most prestigious journals in Paris and being published in it put Gobineau in the same company as George Sand Théophile Gautier Philarète Chasles Alphonse de Lamartine Edgar Quinet and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve who were all published regularly in that journal.

Gobineaus writings on international politics were generally as negative as his writings on France. He depicted Britain as a nation motivated entirely by hatred and greed and the extent of the British Empire around the globe as a source of regret. Gobineau often attacked King Louis-Phillipe for his pro-British foreign policy writing that he had humiliated France by allowing the British Empire to become the worlds dominant power. However reports on the poor economic state of Ireland were a source of satisfaction for Gobineau as he asserted It is Ireland which is pushing England into the abyss of revolution.

According to Gobineau the growing power and aggressiveness of Imperial Russia were a cause for concern. He regarded the disastrous retreat from Kabul by the British during the First Anglo-Afghan War with Afghanistan as a sign Russia would be the dominant power in Asia writing England an aging nation is defending its livelihood and its existence. Russia a youthful nation is following its path towards the power that it must surely gain ... The empire of the Tsars is today the power which seems to have the greatest future ... The Russian people are marching steadfastly towards a goal that is indeed known but still not completely defined. Gobineau regarded Russia as an Asian power and felt the inevitable triumph of Russia was a triumph of Asia over Europe.

He had mixed feelings about the German states praising Prussia as a conservative society dominated by the Junkers. But he worried increasing economic growth promoted by the Zollverein was making the Prussian middle-class more powerful. Gobineau was critical of the Austrian Empire writing that the House of Habsburg ruled over a mixed population of ethnic Germans Magyars Italians Slavic peoples etc. and it was inevitable such a multi-ethnic society would go into decline while the purely German Prussia was destined to unify Germany.

Gobineau was also pessimistic about Italy writing Shortly after the condottieri disappeared everything that had lived and flourished with them went too; wealth gallantry art and liberty there remained nothing but a fertile land and an incomparable sky. Gobineau denounced Spain for rejecting a firm and natural authority a power rooted in national liberty predicting that without order imposed by an absolute monarchy she was destined to sink into a state of perpetual revolution. He was dismissive of Latin America writing with references to the wars of independence The destruction of their agriculture trade and finances the inevitable consequence of long civil disorder did not at all seem to them a price too high to pay for what they had in view. And yet who would want to claim that the half-barbarous inhabitants of Castile or the Algarve or the gauchos on the River Plate really deserve to sit as supreme legislators in the places which they have contested against their masters with such pleasure and energy.

About the United States Gobineau wrote The only greatness is that of wealth and as everyone can acquire this its ownership is independent of any of the qualities reserved to superior natures. Gobineau wrote the United States lacked an aristocracy with no sense of noblesse oblige as existed in Europe. The American poor suffered worse than the European poor causing the United States to be a violent society where greed and materialism were the only values that counted. In general Gobineau was hostile towards people in the Americas writing that who in the Old World does not know that the New World knows nothing of kings princes and nobles-that on those semi-virgin lands in human societies born yesterday and scarcely yet consolidated no one has the right or the power to call himself any greater than the very least of its citizens

In 1846 Gobineau married Clémence Gabrielle Monnerot. She had pressed for a hasty marriage as she was pregnant by their mutual friend Pierre de Serre who had abandoned her. As a practicing Catholic she did not wish to give birth to an illegitimate child. Monnerot had been born in Martinique. As with his mother Gobineau was never entirely certain if his wife and hence his two daughters had black ancestors or not as it was a common practice for French slave masters in the Caribbean to take a slave mistress. Gobineaus opposition to slavery which he held always resulted in harmful miscegenation to whites stemmed from his own personal anxieties that his mother or his wife might have African ancestry.

Gobineaus novels and poems of the 1830s40s were usually set in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance with aristocratic heroes who by their very existence uphold all of the values Gobineau felt were worth celebrating like honor and creativity against a corrupt soulless middle class. His 1847 novel Ternove was the first time Gobineau linked class with race writing Monsieur de Marvejols would think of himself and of all members of the nobility as of a race apart of a superior essence and he believed it criminal to sully this by mixture with plebeian blood. The novel set against the backdrop of the Hundred Days of 1815 concerns the disastrous results when an aristocrat Octave de Ternove unwisely marries the daughter of a miller.

Gobineau was horrified by the Revolution of 1848 and disgusted by what he saw as the supine reaction of the European upper classes to the revolutionary challenge. Writing in the spring of 1848 about the news from Germany he noted Things are going pretty badly ... I do not mean the dismissal of the princesthat was deserved. Their cowardice and lack of political faith make them scarcely interesting. But the peasants there they are nearly barbarous. There is pillage and burning and massacreand we are only at the beginning.

As a Legitimist Gobineau disliked the House of Bonaparte and was displeased when Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president of the republic in 1848. However he came to support Bonaparte as the best man to preserve order and in 1849 when Tocqueville became Foreign Minister his friend Gobineau became his chef de cabinet.

Et les Germains montrant leur chevelure blonde Que portaient leurs aïeux dans tous les coins du monde Paraissent pour régner. Neptune et son trident Servent lAnglo-Saxon leur dernier descendant Et les déserts peuplés de la jeune Amérique Connaissenet le pouvior de ce peuple héroïque Mais Romains Allemands Gaulois Pour en finir Ce qui nest pas Germain est créé pour servir.

And the Germanic People displaying the blond hair of their ancestors emerged to rule in every corner of the world. Neptune and his trident serve the Anglo-Saxon their last descendant and the peopled deserts of young America know the strength of this heroic people. But as to the Romans Germans Gauls to put it briefly those who are not German are created to serve.

Reflecting his disdain for ordinary people Gobineau said French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who conquered the Roman province of Gaul in the fifth century AD while common French people were the descendants of racially inferior Celtic and Mediterranean people. This was an old theory first promoted in a tract by Count Henri de Boulainvilliers. He had argued that the Second Estate was of Frankish blood and the Third Estate were of Gaulish blood. Born after the French Revolution had destroyed the idealized Ancien Régime of his imagination Gobineau felt a deep sense of pessimism regarding the future.

For him the French Revolution having destroyed the racial basis of French greatness by overthrowing and in many cases killing the aristocracy was the beginning of a long irresistible process of decline and degeneration which could only end with the utter collapse of European civilization. He felt what the French Revolution had begun the Industrial Revolution was finishing; industrialization and urbanization were a complete disaster for Europe.

Like many other European romantic conservatives Gobineau looked back nostalgically at an idealized version of the Middle Ages as an idyllic agrarian society living harmoniously in a rigid social order. He loathed modern Paris a city he called a giant cesspool full of les déracinés the criminal impoverished drifting men with no real home. Gobineau considered them to be the monstrous products of centuries of miscegenation ready to explode in revolutionary violence at any moment. He was an ardent opponent of democracy which he stated was mere mobocracya system that allowed the utterly stupid mob the final say on running the state.

From November 1849 to January 1854 Gobineau was stationed at the French legation in Bern as the First Secretary. During his time in Switzerland Gobineau wrote the majority of the Essai.

He was stationed in Hanover in the fall of 1851 as acting Chargé dAffaires and was impressed by the traces of real nobility he said he saw at the Hanoverian court. Gobineau especially liked the blind King George V whom he saw as a philosopher-king and to whom he dedicated the Essais. He praised the remarkable character of Hanoverian men and likewise commended Hanoverian society as having an instinctive preference for hierarchy with the commoners always deferring to the nobility which he explained on racial grounds.

Reflecting his lifelong interest in the Orient Gobineau joined the Société Asiatique in 1852 and got to know several French Orientalists like Julius von Mohl very well.

In January 1854 Gobineau was sent as First Secretary to the French legation at the Free City of Frankfurt. Of the Federal Convention of the German Confederation that sat in Frankfurtalso known as the Confederation DietGobineau wrote The Diet is a business office for the German bureaucracyit is very far from being a real political body. Gobineau hated the Prussian representative at the Diet Prince Otto von Bismarck because of his advances towards Madame Gobineau. By contrast the Austrian representative General Anton von Prokesch-Osten became one of Gobineaus best friends. He was a reactionary Austrian soldier and diplomat who hated democracy and saw himself as a historian and orientalist and for all these reasons Gobineau bonded with him. It was during these periods that Gobineau began to write less often to his old liberal friend Tocqueville and more often to his new conservative friend Prokesch-Osten.

In his own lifetime Gobineau was known as a novelist a poet and for his travel writing recounting his adventures in Iran and Brazil rather than for the racial theories for which he is now mostly remembered. However he always regarded his book Essai sur linégalité des races humaines as his masterpiece and wanted to be remembered as its author. A firm reactionary who believed in the innate superiority of aristocrats over commonerswhom he held in utter contemptGobineau embraced the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism to justify aristocratic rule over racially inferior commoners.

Gobineau came to believe race created culture. He argued that distinctions among the three racesblack white and yellowwere natural barriers; race-mixing breaks those barriers and leads to chaos. Of the three races he argued blacks were physically very strong but incapable of intelligent thought. Regarding the yellows he said they were physically and intellectually mediocre but had an extremely strong materialism that allowed them to achieve certain results. Finally Gobineau wrote whites were the best and greatest of the three races as they alone were capable of intelligent thought creating beauty and were the most beautiful. The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty intelligence and strength he wrote and any positive qualities the Asians and blacks possessed was due to subsequent miscegenation.

Within the white race there was a further subdivision between the Aryans who were the epitome of all that was great about the white race and non-Aryans. Gobineau took the term Aryan from Hindu legend and mythology which describes how the Indian subcontinent was conquered at some time in the distant past by the Aryans. This is generally believed to have reflected folk memories of the arrival of the Indo-European peoples into the Indian subcontinent. The ancient Hindu scriptures with their tales of Aryan heroes were of major interest to scholars attempting to trace the origins of the Indo-European peoples.Gobineau believed the white race had originated somewhere in Siberia the Asians in the Americas and the blacks in Africa. He thought the numerical superiority of the Asians had forced the whites to make a vast migration that led them into Europe the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent; both the Bible and Hindu legends about the conquering Aryan heroes reflected folk memories of this migration. In turn the whites had broken into three sub-races namely the Hamitic Semitic and Japhetic peoples. The latter were the Aryans of Hindu legends and were the best and greatest of all the whites.

In his An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races published in 1855 Gobineau ultimately accepts the prevailing Christian doctrine that all human beings shared the common ancestors Adam and Eve . He suggests however that nothing proves that at the first redaction of the Adamite genealogies the colored races were considered as forming part of the species; and We may conclude that the power of producing fertile offspring is among the marks of a distinct species. As nothing leads us to believe that the human race is outside this rule there is no answer to this argument. He originally wrote that given the past trajectory of civilization in Europe white race miscegenation was inevitable and would result in growing chaos. Despite his opinion that whites were the most beautiful of the races he believed Asian and black women had immense powers of sexual attraction over white men. Whenever whites were in close proximity to blacks and Asians the result was always miscegenation as white men were seduced by the beauty of Asian and black women to the detriment of whites. Though not expressly obsessed with antisemitism Gobineau saw the Jews as praiseworthy for their ability to avoid miscegenation while at the same time depicting them as another alien force for the decay of Aryan Europe.

So the brain of a Huron Indian contains in undeveloped form an intellect which is absolutely that same as an Englishman or a Frenchman Why then in the course of the ages has he not then invented printing or steam power

Gobineau asserted that the Aryans had founded the ten great civilizations of the world writing In the ten civilizations no Negro race is seen an initiator. Only when it is mixed with some other can it even be initiated into a civilization. Similarly no spontaneous civilization is to be found among the yellow races; and when the Aryan blood is exhausted stagnation supervenes. Gobineau mindful of his own supposed noble and Frankish descent classified the Germanic peoples as being the Aryans in Europe.

He believed Aryans had also moved into India and Persia. Gobineau used medieval Persian epic poetry which he treated as completely historically accurate accounts together with the beauty of Persian women to argue that Persians were once great Aryans but unfortunately the Persians had interbred too often with the Semitic Arabs for their own good. At the same time Gobineau argued that in Southeast Asia the blacks and Asians had intermixed to create the sub-race of the Malays. He classified Southern Europe Eastern Europe the Middle East Central Asia and North Africa as racially mixed.

Gobineaus primary thesis was that European civilization flowed from Greece to Rome and then to Germanic and contemporary civilization. He thought this corresponded to the ancient Indo-European culture which earlier anthropologists had misconceived as Aryana term that only Indo-Iranians are known to have used in ancient times. This included groups classified by language like the Celts Slavs and the Germans. Gobineau later came to use and reserve the term Aryan only for the Germanic race and described the Aryans as la race germanique. By doing so he presented a racist theory in which Aryansthat is Germanic Peoplewere all that was positive.

Gobineau described the Aryans as physically extremely beautiful and very tall; of immense intelligence and strength and endowed with incredible energy great creativity in the arts and a love of war. Like many other racists he believed ones looks determined what one did or in other words that beautiful people created beautiful art while ugly people created ugly art.

He attributed much of the economic turmoil in France to pollution of the races. Gobineau ended the Essai with the prediction that the Asian Russian Empire would soon be the dominant power in Europe. It would then be superseded by China once that state was modernized and the Chinese would then conquer Europe. Gobineau warned Tocqueville against the great desire to open up China as the French should examine more carefully the consequences of such camaraderie.

Despite his pride in being French Gobineau often attacked many aspects of French life under the Third Republic as reflecting democratic degenerationnamely the chaos that he believed resulted when the mindless masses were allowed political powerwhich meant that critical reception of Gobineau in France was very mixed. His contempt for ordinary people emerges from his letters where his preferred term for common folk was la boue . Gobineau questioned the belief that the black and yellow races belong to the same human family as the white race and share a common ancestor. Trained neither as a theologian nor a naturalist and writing before the popular spread of evolutionary theory Gobineau took the Bible to be a true telling of human history.

The Essai attracted mostly negative reviews from French critics which Gobineau used as a proof of the supposed truth of his racial theories writing the French who are always ready to set anything afirematerially speakingand who respect nothing either in religion or politics have always been the worlds greatest cowards in matters of science. However events such as the expansion of European and American influence overseas and the unification of Germany led Gobineau to alter his opinion to believe the white race could be saved. The German-born American historian George Mosse argued that Gobineau projected his fear and hatred of the French middle and working classes onto Asian and Black people.

Summarizing Mosses argument Davies argued that The self-serving materialistic oriental of the Essai was really an anti-capitalists portrait of the money-grubbing French middle class while the sensual unintelligent and violent negro that Gobineau portrayed in the Essai was an aristocratic caricature of the French poor. In his writings on the French peasantry Gobineau characteristically insisted in numerous anecdotes which he said were based on personal experience that French farmers were coarse crude people incapable of learning indeed of any sort of thinking beyond the most rudimentary level of thought. As the American critic Michelle Wright wrote the peasant may inhabit the land but they are certainly not part of it. Wright further noted the very marked similarity between Gobineaus picture of the French peasantry and his view of blacks.

In 1855 Gobineau left Paris to become the first secretary at the French legation in Tehran Persia . He was promoted to chargé daffaires the following year. The histories of Persia and Greece had played prominent roles in the Essai and Gobineau wanted to see both places for himself. His mission was to keep Persia out of the Russian sphere of influence but he cynically wrote If the Persians ... unite with the western powers they will march against the Russians in the morning be defeated by them at noon and become their allies by evening. Gobineaus time was not taxed by his diplomatic duties and he spent time studying ancient cuneiform texts and learning Persian. He came to speak a kitchen Persian that allowed him to talk to Persians somewhat. Despite having some love for the Persians Gobineau was shocked they lacked his racial prejudices and were willing to accept blacks as equals. He criticized Persian society for being too democratic.

Gobineau saw Persia as a land without a future destined to be conquered by the West sooner or later. For him this was a tragedy for the West. He believed Western men would all too easily be seduced by the beautiful Persian women causing more miscegenation to further corrupt the West. However he was obsessed with ancient Persia seeing in Achaemenid Persia a great and glorious Aryan civilization now sadly gone. This was to preoccupy him for the rest of his life. Gobineau loved to visit the ruins of the Achaemenid period as his mind was fundamentally backward looking preferring to contemplate past glories rather than what he saw as a dismal present and even bleaker future.

His time in Persia inspired two books Mémoire sur létat social de la Perse actuelle and Trois ans en Asie .

Gobineau was less than complimentary about modern Persia. He wrote to Prokesch-Osten that there was no Persian race as modern Persians were a breed mixed from God knows what. He loved ancient Persia as the great Aryan civilization par excellence however noting that Iran means the land of the Aryans in Persian. Gobineau was less Euro-centric than one might expect in his writings on Persia believing the origins of European civilization could be traced to Persia. He criticized western scholars for their collective vanity in being unable to admit to the Wests huge debt to Persia.

They are a very mixed assortment of the most degenerate races in olden-day Europe. They are the human flotsam of all ages Irish crossbreed Germans and French and Italians of even more doubtful stock. The intermixture of all these decadent ethnic varieties will inevitably give birth to further ethnic chaos. This chaos is no way unexpected or new it will produce no further ethnic mixture which has not already been or cannot be realized on our own continent. Absolutely nothing productive will result from it and even when ethnic combinations resulting from infinite unions between Germans Irish Italians French and Anglo-Saxons join us in the south with racial elements composed of Indian Negro Spanish and Portuguese essence it is quite unimaginable that anything could result from such horrible confusions but an incoherent juxtaposition of the most decadent kinds of people.

In 1859 an Anglo-French dispute over the French fishing rights on the French Shore of Newfoundland led to an Anglo-French commission being sent to Newfoundland to find a resolution to the dispute. Gobineau was one of the two French commissioners dispatched to Newfoundland an experience that he later recorded in his 1861 book Voyage à Terre-Neuve . In 1858 the Foreign Minister Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski had tried to send Gobineau to the French legation in Beijing. He objected that as a civilized European he had no wish to go to an Asian country like China. As punishment Walewski sent Gobineau to Newfoundland telling him he would be fired from the Quai dOrsay if he refused the Newfoundland assignment.

I am not sorry to have seen once in my life a sort of Utopia. But this is what succeeds in enabling men to make use of complete liberty and to be tolerant of one another.

In 1861 Gobineau returned to Tehran as the French minister and lived a modest ascetic lifestyle. He became obsessed with ancient Persia. This soon got out of control as he sought to prove ancient Persia was founded by his much admired Aryans leading him to engage in what Irwin called deranged theories about Persias history. In 1865 Gobineau published Les religions et les philosophies dans lAsie centrale an account of his travels in Persia and encounters with the various esoteric Islamic sects he discovered being practiced in the Persian countryside. His mystical frame of mind led him to feel in Persia what he called un certain plaisir as nowhere else in the world did he feel the same sort of joy he felt when viewing the ruins of Persia.

Gobineau had a low opinion of Islam a religion invented by the Arab Mohammed. He viewed him as part of the Semitic race unlike the Persians whose Indo-European language led him to see them as Aryans. Gobineau believed that Shia Islam was part of a revolt by the Aryan Persians against the Semitic Arabs seeing a close connection between Shia Islam and Persian nationalism. His understanding of Persia was distorted and confused. He mistakenly believed Shiism was practiced only in Persia and that in Shiism the Imam Ali is much more venerated than Muhammad. He was unaware that Shia Islam only became the state religion of Persia under the Safavids. Based on his own experiences Gobineau believed the Persians did not really believe in Islam with the faith of the Prophet being a cover over a society that still preserved many pre-Islamic features. Gobineau also described the savage persecution of the followers of Bábism and of the new religion of the Baháʼí Faith by the Persian state which was determined to uphold Shia Islam as the state religion. Gobineau approved of the persecution of the Babi. He wrote they were veritable communists and true and pure supporters of socialism as every bit as dangerous as the French socialists. He agreed the Peacock Throne was right to stamp out Bábism. Gobineau was one of the first Westerners to examine the esoteric sects of Persia. Though his work was idiosyncratic he did spark scholarly interest in an aspect of Persia that had been ignored by Westerners until then. His command of Persian was average his Arabic was worse. Since there were few Western Orientalists who knew Persian however Gobineau was able to pass himself off for decades as a leading Orientalist who knew Persia like no one else.

Only with his studies in ancient Persia did Gobineau come under fire from scholars. He published two books on ancient Persia Lectures des textes cunéiformes and Traité des écritures cunéiformes . Irwin wrote The first treatise is wrong-headed yet still on this side of sanity; the second later and much longer work shows many signs of the kind of derangement that is likely to infect those who interest themselves too closely in the study of occultism. One of the principal problems with Gobineaus approach to translating the cuneiform texts of ancient Persia was that he failed to understand linguistic change and that Old Persian was not the same language as modern Persian. His books met with hostile reception from scholars who argued that Gobineau simply did not understand the texts he was purporting to translate.

Gobineaus article attempting to rebut his critics in the Journal asiatique was not published as the editors had to politely tell him his article was unpublishable as it was full of absurd claims and vitriolic abuse of his critics. During his second time in Persia Gobineau spent much time working as an amateur archeologist and gathering material for what was to become Traité des écritures cunéiformes a book that Irwin called a monument to learned madness. Gobineau was always very proud of it seeing the book as a magnum opus that rivaled the Essai. Gobineau had often traveled from Tehran to the Ottoman Empire to visit the ruins of Dur-Sharrukin at Khorsabad near Mosul in what is now northern Iraq. The ruins of Khorsabad are Assyrian built by King Sargon II in 717 BC but Gobineau decided the ruins were actually Persian and built by Darius the Great some two hundred years later.

French archeologist Paul-Émile Botta published a scathing review of Traité des écritures cunéiformes in the Journal asiatique. He wrote the cuneiform texts at the Dur-Sharrukin were Akkadian that Gobineau did not know what he was talking about and the only reason he had even written the review was to prove that he had wasted his time reading the book. As Gobineau insistently pressed his thesis the leading French Orientalist Julius von Mohl of the Société asiatique was forced to intervene in the dispute to argue that Gobineaus theories which were to a large extent based on numerology and other mystical theories lacked scientific rigor and the most favorable thing he could say was that he admired the artistry of Gobineaus thesis.

Continuing his Persian obsession Gobineau published Histoire des Perses in 1869. In it he did not attempt to distinguish between Persian history and legends treating the Shahnameh and the Kush Nama as factual reliable accounts of Persias ancient history. As such Gobineau began his history by presenting the Persians as Aryans who arrived in Persia from Central Asia and conquered the race of giants known to them as the Diws. Gobineau also added his own racial theories to the Histoire des Perses explaining how Cyrus the Great had planned the migration of the Aryans into Europe making him responsible for the grandeur of medieval Europe. For Gobineau Cyrus the Great was the greatest leader in history writing Whatever we ourselves are as Frenchmen Englishmen Germans Europeans of the nineteenth century it is to Cyrus that we owe it going on to call Cyrus as the greatest of the great men in all human history.

In 1864 Gobineau became the French minister to Greece. During his time in Athens which with Tehran were the only cities he was stationed in that he liked he spent his time writing poetry and learning about sculpture when not traveling with Ernest Renan in the Greek countryside in search of ruins. Gobineau seduced two sisters in Athens Zoé and Marika Dragoumis who became his mistresses; Zoé remained a lifelong correspondent. However great his enthusiasm for ancient Greece Gobineau was less than complimentary about modern Greece. He wrote that due to miscegenation the Greek people had lost the Aryan blood responsible for the glory that was Greece. Now the Greeks had a mixture of Arab Bulgarian Turkish Serbian and Albanian blood.

The Greeks will not control the Orient neither will the Armenians nor the Slav nor any Christian population and at the same time if others were to comeeven the Russians the most oriental of them allthey could only submit to the harmful influences of this anarchic situation. there is no Eastern Question and if I had the honour of being a great government I should concern myself no longer with developments in these areas.

In the spring of 1866 Christian Greeks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire on the island of Crete. Three emissaries arrived in Athens to ask Gobineau for French support for the uprising saying it was well known that France was the champion of justice and the rights of small nations. As France was heavily engaged in the war in Mexico Gobineau speaking for Napoleon III informed the Cretans to expect no support from Francethey were on their own in taking on the Ottoman Empire. He had no sympathy with the Greek desire to liberate their compatriots living under Ottoman rule; writing to his friend Anton von Prokesch-Osten he noted It is one rabble against another.

Gobineau called the Cretan uprising the most perfect monument to lies mischief and impudence that has been seen in thirty years. During the uprising a young French academic Gustave Flourens noted for his fiery enthusiasm for liberal causes had joined the Cretean uprising and had gone to Athens to try to persuade the Greek government to support it. Gobineau had unwisely shown Flourens diplomatic dispatches from Paris showing both the French and Greek governments were unwilling to offend the Ottomans by supporting the Cretan uprising which Flourens then leaked to the press. Gobineau received orders from Napoleon III to silence Flourens. On 28 May 1868 while Flourens was heading for a meeting with King George I he was intercepted by Gobineau who had him arrested by the legation guards put into chains and loaded onto the first French ship heading for Marseille.Laffaire Flourens became a cause célèbre in France with novelist Victor Hugo condemning Gobineau in an opinion piece in Le Tribute on 19 July 1868 for the treacherous way he had treated a fellow Frenchman fighting for Greek freedom. With French public opinion widely condemning the minister in Athens Gobineau was recalled to Paris in disgrace.

In 1869 Gobineau was appointed the French minister to Brazil. At the time France and Brazil did not have diplomatic relations at an ambassadorial level only legations headed by ministers. Gobineau was unhappy the Quai dOrsay had sent him to Brazil which he viewed as an insufficiently grand posting. Gobineau landed in Rio de Janeiro during the riotously sensual Carnival which disgusted him. From that moment on he detested Brazil which he saw as a culturally backward and unsanitary place of diseases. He feared falling victim to the yellow fever that decimated the population of Brazil on a regular basis. The only thing that pleased him as he landed in Rio was seeing black slaves whose backs bore the scars of whippings unload his luggage. Gobineaus major duties during his time in Brazil from March 1869 to April 1870 were to help mediate the end of the Paraguayan War and seek compensation after Brazilian troops looted the French legation in Asunción. He did so and was equally successful in negotiating an extradition treaty between the French Empire and the Empire of Brazil. He dropped hints to Emperor Pedro II that French public opinion favored the emancipation of Brazils slaves. As slavery was the basis of Brazils economy and Brazil had the largest slave population in the Americas Pedro II was unwilling to abolish slavery at this time.

As most Brazilians have a mixture of Portuguese African and Indian ancestry Gobineau saw the Brazilian people whom he loathed as confirming his theories about the perils of miscegenation. He wrote to Paris that Brazilians were a population totally mixed vitiated in its blood and spirit fearfully ugly ... Not a single Brazilian has pure blood because of the pattern of marriages among whites Indians and Negroes is so widespread that the nuances of color are infinite causing a degeneration among the lower as well the upper classes. He noted Brazilians are neither hard-working active nor fertile. Based on all this Gobineau reached the conclusion that all human life would cease in Brazil within the next 200 years on the grounds of genetic degeneracy.

Gobineau was unpopular in Brazil. His letters to Paris show his complete contempt for everybody in Brazil regardless of their nationality with his most damning words reserved for Brazilians. He wrote about Brazil Everyone is ugly here unbelievably ugly like apes. His only friend during his time in Rio was Emperor Pedro II whom Gobineau praised as a wise and great leader noting his blue eyes and blond hair as proof that Pedro was an Aryan. The fact Pedro was of the House of Braganza left Gobineau assured he had no African or Indian blood. Gobineau wrote Except for the Emperor there is no one in this desert full of thieves who was worthy of his friendship.

Gobineaus attitudes of contempt for the Brazilian people led him to spend much of his time feuding with the Brazilian elite. In 1870 he was involved in a bloody street brawl with the son-in-law of a Brazilian senator who did not appreciate having his nation being put down. As a result of the brawl Pedro II asked Paris to have his friend recalled or he would declare him persona non-grata. Rather than suffer the humiliation of this happening to the French minister the Quai dOrsay promptly recalled Gobineau.

In May 1870 Gobineau returned to France from Brazil. In a letter to Tocqueville in 1859 he wrote When we come to the French people I genuinely favor absolute power and as long as Napoleon III ruled as an autocrat he had Gobineaus support. Gobineau had often predicted France was so rotten the French were bound to be defeated if they ever fought a major war. At the outbreak of the war with Prussia in July 1870 however he believed they would win within a few weeks. After the German victory Gobineau triumphantly used his own countrys defeat as proof of his racial theories. He spent the war as the maire of the little town of Trie in Oise department. After the Prussians occupied Trie Gobineau established good relations with them and was able to reduce the indemnity imposed on Oise department.

Later Gobineau wrote a book Ce qui est arrivé à la France en 1870 explaining the French defeat was due to racial degeneration which no publisher chose to publish. He argued the French bourgeoisie were descended from Gallo-Roman slaves which explained why they were no match for an army commanded by Junkers. Gobineau attacked Napoleon III for his plans to rebuild Paris writing This city pompously described as the capital of the universe is in reality only the vast caravanserai for the idleness greed and carousing of all Europe.

Gobineau is a man of about 55 with grey hair and moustache dark rather prominent eyes sallow complexion and tall figure with brisk almost jerky gait. In temperament he is nervous energetic in manner observant but distrait passing rapidly from thought to thought a good talker but a bad listener. He is a savant novelist poet sculptor archaeologist a man of taste a man of the world.

In May 1872 Gobineau was appointed the French minister to Sweden. After arriving in Stockholm he wrote to his sister Caroline This is the pure race of the Norththat of the masters calling the Swedes the purest branch of the Germanic race. In contrast to France Gobineau was impressed with the lack of social conflict in Sweden writing to Dragoumis There is no class hatred. The nobility lives on friendly terms with the middle class and with the people at large. Gobineau argued that because of Swedens remote location in Scandinavia Aryan blood had been better preserved as compared to France. Writing about the accession of Oscar II to the Swedish throne in 1872 he said This country is unique ... I have just seen one king die and another ascend the throne without anyone doubling the guard or alerting a soldier. The essential conservatism of Swedish society also impressed Gobineau as he wrote to Pedro II The conservative feeling is amongst the most powerful in the national spirit and these people relinquish the past only step by step and with extreme caution.

Sweden presented a problem for Gobineau between reconciling his belief in an Aryan master race with his insistence that only the upper classes were Aryans. He eventually resolved this by denouncing the Swedes as debased Aryans after all. He used the fact King Oscar allowed Swedish democracy to exist and did not try to rule as an absolute monarch as evidence the House of Bernadotte were all weak and cowardly kings. By 1875 Gobineau was writing Sweden horrifies me and wrote with disgust about Swedish vulgarity and contemptibility.

In 1874 Gobineau met the homosexual German diplomat Prince Philip von Eulenburg in Stockholm and became very close to him. Eulenburg was later to recall fondly how he and Gobineau had spent hours during their time in Sweden under the Nordic sky where the old world of the gods lived on in the customs and habits of the people as well in their hearts. Gobineau later wrote that only two people in the entire world had ever properly understood his racist philosophy namely Richard Wagner and Eulenburg.

Gobineau encouraged Eulenburg to promote his theory of an Aryan master-race telling him In this way you will help many people understand things sooner. Later Eulenburg was to complain all of his letters to Gobineau had to be destroyed because They contain too much of an intimately personal nature. During his time in Sweden Gobineau became obsessed with the Vikings and became intent on proving he was descended from the Norse. His time in Stockholm was a very productive period from a literary viewpoint. He wrote Les Pléiades Les Nouvelles Asiatiques La Renaissance most of Histoire de Ottar Jarl pirate norvégien conquérant du pays de Bray en Normandie et de sa descendance and completed the first half of his epic poem Amadis while serving as minister to Sweden.

In 1879 Gobineau attempted to prove his own racial superiority over the rest of the French with his pseudo-family history Histoire de Ottar Jarl. It begins with the line I descend from Odin and traces his supposed descent from the Viking Ottar Jarl. As the de Gobineau family first appeared in history in late 15th century Bordeaux and Ottar Jarlwho may or may not have been a real personis said to have lived in the 10th century Gobineau had to resort to a great deal of invention to make his genealogy work. For him the Essai the Histoire des Perses and Histoire de Ottar Jarl comprised a trilogy what the French critic Jean Caulmier called a poetic vision of the human adventure covering the universal history of all races in the Essai to the history of the Aryan branch in Persia in Histoire des Perses to his own familys history in Histoire de Ottar Jarl.

During his time in Sweden although remaining outwardly faithful to the Catholic Church Gobineau privately abandoned his belief in Christianity. He was very interested in the pagan religion of the Vikings which seemed more authentically Aryan to him. For him maintaining his Catholicism was a symbol of his reactionary politics and rejection of liberalism and it was for these reasons he continued to nominally observe Catholicism. Gobineau told his friend the Comte de Basterot that he wanted a Catholic burial only because the de Gobineaus had always been buried in Catholic ceremonies not because of any belief in Catholicism.

For leaving his post in Stockholm without permission to join the Emperor Pedro II on his European visit Gobineau was told in January 1877 to either resign from the Quai dOrsay or be fired; he chose the former.

Gobineau spent his last years living in Rome a lonely and embittered man whose principal friends were the Wagners and Eulenburg. He saw himself as a great sculptor and attempted to support himself by selling his sculpture.

Besides promoting racism Gobineau also wrote several well received novels. Writers such as Marcel Proust Jean Cocteau and André Gide have praised him as one of Frances greatest novelists. In his native France he has been and is still often praised by literary critics as a master of French style whose novels were written with elegant verve and a superb sense of irony. French critic Pierre-Louis Rey and British historian Michael D. Biddiss have both decried the tendency of French critics to sever Gobineau the racist from Gobineau the novelist maintaining his novels reflect his racial theories just as much as the Essai. Gobineaus 1874 novel Les Pléiades is concerned with a few exceptionally talented people who are examples of ethnic persistence in Europe surrounded by vast masses of morons. In his introduction to Les Pléiades Gobineau says the purpose of the novel is to advance the theory that there are no longer classes that there are no longer peoples but onlyin the whole of Europecertain individuals who float like the wreckage upon the flood.

Another one of his literary works is Nouvelles Asiatiques which concerns the impact of miscegenation in modern Asia as reflected in the life stories of a diverse group of people.Nouvelles Asiatiques is unique as his only novel to feature non-white protagonists. In common with his other novels its message is fundamentally pessimistic but it allows Gobineaus intense affection for Persia to shine through.

Despite its title Nouvelles Asiatiques is a series of Oriental short stories set in Persia Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its recurring theme is that the character of the people is determined by race. An example is an Uzbek noblewoman adopted by a Russian officer retaining the ferocity of her race by attempting to blind his biological daughter while an Afghan prince rises far above the rest because of his Aryan blood.

In his 1877 novel La Renaissance Gobineau again highlights the theme of a few gifted Aryan heroes such as Cesare Borgia and Pope Julius II having the misfortune to be surrounded by an endless multitude of debased inferiors. In La Renaissance he attacks the entire idea of morality as the basis of action arguing that a superior few should not be governed by any set of universal moral values. As such Pope Alexander VI is presented as a hero in La Renaissance precisely because of the utterly ruthless way in which he advanced the interests of the Borgia family in defiance of morality.

Though a proud Frenchman Gobineau was cosmopolitan and regarded himself as part of a cultured European elite that transcended national loyaltiesa good Frenchman but even more so a good European. Gobineau felt more affinity for fellow aristocrats of other nationalities than he did for French commoners. The Czech historian Ivo Budil called him ... a cosmopolitan thinker who did not feel wholly French and who was obsessed with ancient Greece and Persia.

In 1876 Gobineau accompanied his close friend Pedro II on his trip to Russia Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Gobineau introduced him to both Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire. He took his friend on a guided tour of Athens a city he called heaven on earth due to its ruins. Inspired by his last visit to Greece Gobineau began to write what became his 1878 book Le Royaume des Hellènes . In it he argues the achievements of ancient Greece were all due to the Aryans and there existed no connection between the ancient Greeks and modern Greeks as the Aryan blood was all gone. After leaving Pedro II in Constantinople Gobineau traveled to Rome Italy for a private audience with Pope Pius IX.

During his visit to Rome Gobineau met and befriended the German composer Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima. Wagner was greatly impressed with the Essai sur linégalité des races humaines and he used his newspaper Bayreuther Blätter to popularize Gobineaus racial theories in Germany. Gobineau in turn was greatly impressed with Wagners music and unusually for a Frenchman he became a member of the Bayreuth Circle. Wagner was very interesred in Gobineaus racial theories and many of his writings from the period show Gobineaus influence. Field wrote that Gobineaus chief work Essai sur linégalité des races humaines contained a far more detailed and closely argued explanation for cultural decadence than anything Wagner had written. Indeed this synthesis of anthropology theology linguistics and history was unquestionably the most impressive and ideologically coherent racial analysis produced in the pre-Darwinian era.

It remains a matter of dispute whether Gobineaus ideas were also incorporated into Wagners last opera Parsifal. Cosima Wagner wrote to Gobineau in May 1881 to tell him My husband is quite at your service always reading The Races when he is not at work with the staging. Gobineau wrote back to say I assure you there is no Bayreuthian more faithful than I. Hovewer while accepting some of Gobineaus basic views into his theories Wagner rejected Gobineaus pessimism about the fate of humanity and instead created a concept of regeneration wherein it would return to its past purity by embracing his version of Christianity influenced by the philosophy of Schopenhauer.

Despite having failed the entrance exams to St. Cyr Gobineau had an intensely militaristic view of the world believing different races were born to hate each other and humans have an innate desire to kill one another. He wrote war was a natural part of the human condition and for a nation It will either conquer or be conquered. Gobineau dismissed pacifism writing Even if the friends of universal peace succeeded in making Europe disgusted with war they would still have to bring about a permanent change in the passions of mankind and that peace was only possible if all races were actually gifted in the same degree with the same powers. Despite being a diplomat whose nominal job was to achieve French policy goals without resorting to war and despite his personal distaste for the House of Bonaparte Gobineau very much welcomed the militarism of Napoleon III as bringing greatness back to France. In 1854 Gobineau approved of the Crimean War writing that France would gain much prestige by declaring war on Russia a nation that he had always hated. In a letter to his sister Caroline in October 1854 Gobineau wrote After twenty years of a peace that has promoted only corruption and revolution we find ourselves in a military atmosphere which from its very beginning has encouraged many fine things. I consider war despite its evils as a blessing.

Paradoxically although Gobineau saw hope in the expansion of European power he did not support the creation of commercial empires with their attendant multicultural milieu. He concluded the development of empires was ultimately destructive to the superior races that created them since they led to the mixing of distinct races. Instead he saw the later period of the 19th century imperialism as a degenerative process in European civilization. He continually referred to past empires in Europe and their attendant movement of non-white peoples into European homelands in explaining the ethnography of the nations of Europe.

According to his theories the mixed populations of Spain most of France and Italy most of Southern Germany most of Switzerland and Austria and parts of Britain derived from the historical development of the Roman Greek and Ottoman empires which had brought the non-Aryan peoples of Africa and the Mediterranean cultures to western and northern Europe. He believed the populations of southern and western Iran southern Spain and Italy consisted of a degenerative race arising from miscegenation and the whole of north India consisted of a yellow race. Gobineau was extremely hostile towards Slavic peoples especially Russians who he thought had become a semi-Asian people as a result of miscegenation under the Golden Horde. He described the Slavs as a stagnant marsh in which all superior ethnic strains after a few hours of triumph found themselves engulfed.

Gobineau argued Chinese civilization had been created by a group of Aryan conquerors from India who had brought the indigenous Malay people living there under their heel. Though he had read almost everything written in French about China he believed the origins of Chinese civilization were in southern China. He posited the Aryans from India had first arrived there rather than the Yellow River valley which all Chinese sources regard as the cradle of Chinese civilization.

He argued Chinese culture was without beauty and dignity; the Chinese were lacking in sentiments beyond the humblest notion of physical utility and Chinese Confucianism was a resume of practices and maxims strongly reminiscent of what the moralists of Geneva and their educational books are pleased to recommend as the nec plus ultra of the good economy moderation prudence the art of making a profit and never a loss.

All Chinese literature was puerile according to Gobineau as the Chinese lacked the powers of the imagination that allowed Westerners to write great novels. He considered Chinese theater flat and Chinese poetry ridiculous. The great Chinese scientific works were verbose compilations lacking in the analytic rigor which according to him whites alone were capable of achieving. He asserted the Chinese were incapable of science because the spirit of the yellow race is neither profound nor insightful to attain this quality reserved for the white race. Gobineau believed China was a warning to the West of the perils of democracyby which he meant meritocracy. This was because the Chinese state had attempted to promote education for the masses the rule by the mandarins was meritocratic and the exams to become a mandarin were open to all literate men. For Gobineau this reflected the racially stagnant character of the Chinese.

What the Russians will have done within ten years will be to have opened towards the West the flood-gates to the vast human horde that we find so ill at east in China; and it is an avalanche of Chinese and Slavs mottled with Tartars and Baltic Germans that will put an end to the stupidities and indeed to the civilization of Europe. The United States which fears a yellow invasion from the direction of California will gain little from all this. Europe will lose everything

In 1881 Gobineau published an article in Richard Wagners newspaper the Bayreuther Blätter entitled Ein Urteil über die jetzige Weltage which was translated into German by Cosima Wagner. With a foreword by Wagner himself Gobineau here warned the Chinese would soon overwhelm and destroy Western civilization. Gobineau also called his essay Ce qui se fait en Asie the sequel and the present condition of the Essai. Gobineau praised racist laws meant to restrict Chinese immigration to the United States Canada New Zealand Hawaii and Australia as a good first step but warned that European civilization was so rotten by miscegenation that it was only a matter of time before the Chinese destroyed the West.

In 1884 the French efforts to conquer Vietnam led to war breaking out between France and China. The Sino-French War led to immediate revival of interest in Gobineaus anti-Asian writings in France. Several French newspapers reprinted the French original of Gobineaus 1881 article in the Bayreuther Blätter warning about the imminent Chinese threat to European civilization. Likewise the Franco-Chinese war led to the Essai sur linégalité des races humaines becoming popular in France. The book had been published in four volumes in 185355 and remained out of print for decades. In 1884 just after the war with China began the second and third editions of the Essai sur linégalité des races humaines were published in Paris. This was a direct result of the war as many French people suddenly became interested in a book that portrayed such an unflattering picture of Asians.

Gobineaus ideas were influential in a number of countries both during his lifetime and after his death.

Gobineaus theories were a major influence on the Romanian radical anti-Semitic politician Professor A. C. Cuza who embraced his biological racism as a way of proving the Jews were a plague upon modern Romanian life. Like most of Gobineaus followers Cuza rejected his pessimism as too extreme but he argued that Romanian people formed out of a fusion between the ancient Dacians and Romans had best preserved the Aryan blood and that the Jews as a biologically different people simply did not belong in Romania. Cuza who was deeply impressed with Gobineau often used his theories and rhetoric of racial degeneration to frame his anti-Semitic arguments about the Jewish race. Cuza frequently described the Jews were a plague upon Romania. He asserted the Romanian people were in the midst of the sort of racial degeneration described by Gobineau which for Cuza was caused by the Jews. At various times Cuza had been a mentor to various figures on the Romanian radical right such as Corneliu Zelea Codreanu the poet-politician Octavian Goga and Marshal Ion Antonescu; his influence was considerable in 1930s40s Romania.

Gobineaus theories had a profound influence on the Committee of Union and Progress . The Turks had originated from the land north of the Great Wall of China and migrated across Eurasia to Anatolia. Committee members called the homeland of the Turks Turan and identified themselves with Gobineaus Aryans. He was often mentioned in CUP journals and in 1911 a journal dedicated to promoting the CUPs take on Gobineau was founded in Salonika.

Richard Wagner wrote positively about Gobineau in his late writings and suggested one could not exclude the correctness of his racial theory. At the same time he also disagreed with Gobineaus conclusion that miscegenation unavoidably resulted in the decline of the human race and cultures. In his 1881 article Heldentum und Christentum Wagner praised the Essai and accepted its premise of an Aryan master race and its denunciation of miscegenation but he denied humanity was in unstoppable decay. He thought that Christ died for everyone irrespective of race and from this drew a hope for a fundamental regeneration of humanity based on acceptance of Christianity. Gobineau visited Bayreuth the home of Wagner shortly before his death.

In 1894 the Wagnerite and anti-Semitic journalist Ludwig Schemann founded the Gobineau Vereinigung to promote Gobineaus theories in Germany spawning the Gobinism movement. Schemann was close to Cosima Wagner and was inspired by her to found the Gobineau Vereinigung. It was a small group but it exercised much intellectual influence and in this way popularized the theory of an Aryan master-race in Germany. The Gobineauismus that Schemann and the Gobineau Vereinigung promoted owed as much to Wagner as it did to Gobineau for the group rejected Gobineaus pessimism and believed the Aryan race could be saved. Schemann who was one of the most influential and best known race theorists in Imperial Germany projected an optimistic message about the future of the Aryan race while accepting Gobineaus basic idea about an Aryan master race. Schemann was the man who popularized Gobineau in Germany and it was largely through him rather than reading the Essai directly that Gobineauismus was promoted in the Reich. In 1937 Schemann was personally awarded the Goethe Medal by Hitler for his services to the nation and race.

Adolf Hitler and Nazism borrowed much of Gobineaus ideology. However although a central figure in the development of degeneration theory Gobineau was not antisemitic. He may be characterised as philosemitic having written very positively about Jewish people including a long eulogy to them in his Essai sur linégalité des races describing them as a free strong and intelligent people who succeeded despite the natural disadvantages of the Land of Israel. In his later years however he inclined according to Paul Lawrence Rose toward a vague personal antisemitism.

His racist ideology through rooted in social and political concerns and though claiming to explain the nature of society itself could not on his own terms effect any transformation. But Gobineau unfortunately failed to realize the degree to which such a theorywhatever his own view of its impotencemight be capable of use and adaptation by others to affect society and history. His work would in time be plundered by racists with an interest in preaching explicitly reformatory doctrines.

Despite his highly negative assessment of Brazilians Gobineau became a hero to certain Brazilian intellectuals. In a 1906 essay the intellectual Sílvio Romero cited Gobineau together with Otto Ammon Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Houston Stewart Chamberlain as having proved that the blond dolichocephalic people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world. He wrote that Brazil could become a great nation by having a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the embranquecimento of Brazil. In 1912 Romero praised Gobineau in an essay for admirable genius-like vision and his wise words that merit every consideration before launching what the American historian Thomas Skidmore called a violent polemic against Brazils mulatto population as a racially degenerate people who should disappear from Brazil.

Oliveira Viana in his 1920 book As populações meridionais do Brasil offered lavish praise of Gobineau for his denunciation of miscegenation and his disparaging remarks about black and Indian Brazilians. Viannas solution was a plan to Aryanise Brazil by bringing in millions of fair-skinned European immigrants and thus achieve the embranquecimento of Brazil. Vianna served as the education minister under the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas where he was well known for his advocacy of the advantages of Aryan immigration to Brazil.

Until the Second World War Gobineaus writings were cited in Brazil in support of the idea that miscegenation caused physical degeneration and there must be no interracial sex in Brazil if the Brazilian people were to have a positive future. By contrast in reaction to intellectuals like Vianna who cited Gobineau the Brazilian writer Gilberto Freyre wrote a series of books in the 1920s30s praising miscegenation and the black Brazilian culture arguing that the fusion of white black and Indians had given Brazil a distinctive culture and the Brazilian people a distinctive appearance creating the theory of Lusotropicalism. Freyre argued that Gobineau was a snobbish Frenchman who looked down upon Brazilians as not measuring up to Europe. This led Freyre to reject the idea that Europe should be the standard for Brazil arguing the Brazilians had created a new civilization based on an interaction of the descendants of Indians African slaves and European immigrants that was superior to the Europeans with their obsession with racial purity. Freyre dismissed the writings of Gobineau and Chamberlain as diffuse loquacious and wrong.

Although in no way espousing his beliefs the Baháʼí Faith recognizes Gobineau as the person who obtained the only complete manuscript of the early history of the Bábí religious movement of Persia written by Hajji Mirzâ Jân of Kashan who was put to death by the Persian authorities in c.1852."
Lucien Goldmann,"Lucien Goldmann was a French philosopher and sociologist of Jewish-Romanian origin. A professor at the EHESS in Paris he was a Marxist theorist. His wife was sociologist Annie Goldmann.

Goldmann was born in Bucharest Romania but grew up in Botoşani. He studied law at the University of Bucharest and the University of Vienna under the Austromarxist jurist Max Adler. In 1934 he went to the University of Paris to study political economy literature and philosophy. He moved to Switzerland in November 1942 where he was placed in a refugee camp until 1943.

Through Jean Piagets intervention he was subsequently given a scholarship to the University of Zurich where he completed his PhD in philosophy in 1945 with a thesis entitled Mensch Gemeinschaft und Welt in der Philosophie Immanuel Kants .

While many Parisian leftists staunchly upheld Marxisms scientificity in the 1950s and 1960s Lucien Goldmann insisted that Marxism was by then in severe crisis and had to reinvent itself radically if it were to survive. He rejected the traditional Marxist view of the proletariat and contested the structural Marxist movement. In fact the popularity of such trends on the Left Bank was one reason why Goldmanns own name and work were eclipsed this despite the acclaim of thinkers as diverse as Jean Piaget and Alasdair MacIntyre who called him the finest and most intelligent Marxist of the age.

He refused to portray his aspirations for humanitys future as an inexorable unfolding of historys laws but saw them rather as a wager akin to Blaise Pascals in the existence of God. Risk Goldmann wrote in his classic study of Pascals Pensées and Jean Racines Phèdre is possibility of failure hope of success and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition. He called his work dialectical and humanist. He sought to synthesize the genetic epistemology of Piaget with the Marxism of György Lukács.

Goldmann founded the theory of genetic structuralism in the 1960s. He was a humanist socialist a disciple of Lukács and was best known for his sociology of literature. In later life he became an important critic of structuralism.

Victor Goldschmidt (philosopher),"Victor Goldschmidt was a French philosopher and historian of philosophy.

Born in Germany he came to France in 1933. Before the war he studied at the Sorbonne and at the École pratique des hautes études under Henri Marguerite.

Goldschmidt made his name with the publication of his thesis Les Dialogues de Platon in 1947 for which Martial Gueroult was among the members of his examining committee. He taught at the University of Rennes from 1956 to 1966 then at Clermont-Ferrand from 1966 to 1976 and finally in Amiens until his death.

The manuscript of Goldschmidts book on Aristotles views of time was delivered to the editor on the eve of his death.

A volume was published in his memory as Histoire et Structure .

Though Goldschmidt is often considered a disciple of Martial Gueroult Jacques Brunschwig has reconsidered their relationship noting that the second edition of Godschmidts thesis acknowledged a general debt to the rigor of Émile Bréhier rather than Gueroult."
André Gorz,"André Gorz French was an Austrian and French social philosopher and journalist.

He co-founded Le Nouvel Observateur weekly in 1964. A supporter of Jean-Paul Sartres existentialist version of Marxism after the Second World War he became in the aftermath of the May 68 student riots more concerned with political ecology.

In the 1960s and 1970s he was a main theorist in the New Left movement and coined the concept of non-reformist reform. His central theme was wage labour issues such as liberation from work the just distribution of work social alienation and a guaranteed basic income.

Born in Vienna as Gerhart Hirsch he was the son of a Jewish wood-salesman and of a Catholic mother who came from a cultivated background and worked as a secretary. Although his parents did not have any strong sense of national or religious identity the rising anti-Semitism led his father to convert to Catholicism in 1930. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 his mother sent him to an institution in Switzerland to avoid his mobilization into the Wehrmacht. Thereafter Hirsch was a stateless person until 12 April 1957 when he became naturalized as French citizen because of Pierre Mendès-Frances support. He graduated from the École polytechnique at University of Lausanne now EPFL in chemical engineering in 1945.

Working at first as a translator of American short stories published by a Swiss editor he then published his first articles in a co-operative journal. In 1946 he met Jean-Paul Sartre and they became close. Gorz was then influenced mainly by existentialism and phenomenology. He contributed to the journals Les Temps modernes New Left Review Technologie und Politik . In June 1949 he moved to Paris where he worked first at the international secretariat of the Mouvement des Citoyens du Monde then as private secretary of a military attaché of the embassy of India. He then entered Paris-Presse as a journalist and took the pseudonym of Michel Bosquet. There he met with Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber who in 1955 recruited him as an economist journalist for LExpress.

Alongside his journalistic activities Gorz worked closely with Sartre and adopted an existentialist approach to Marxism which led Gorz to emphasize the questions of alienation and of liberation in the framework of existential experience and an analysis of social systems from the viewpoint of individual experience. That intellectual framework formed the basis of his first books Le Traître La Morale de lhistoire and the Fondements pour une morale which he signed for the first time as André Gorz from the German name of the now-Italian city where the eyeglasses that were given to his father by the Austrian Army had been made.

Gorz also was a main theorist in the New Left movement inspired by the young Marx discussions of humanism and alienation and the liberation of humanity. Gorz was also influenced by the Frankfurt School since he was a friend of Herbert Marcuse. Other friends of his included Rossana Rossanda founder of Il Manifesto newspaper the photographer William Klein younger intellectuals such as Marc Kravetz or Tiennot Grumbach and Ronald Fraser of the New Left Review.

He strongly criticised structuralism because of its criticisms of the subject and of subjectivity. He called himself a revolutionary-reformist a democratic socialist who wanted to see system-changing reforms. In 1961 he entered the editorial committee of Les Temps Modernes and introduced to French thought the Italian Garavini the neo-Keynesian and communist Bruno Trentin and the anarcho-syndicalist Vittorio Foa. Imposing himself as the intellectual leader of the Italian tendency of the New Left he influenced activists of the UNEF students union and the CFDT as a theorist of workers self-management which has been recently embraced by the CFDT. His term non-reformist reform refers to proposed programs of change that base their demands on human needs rather than those of the current economic system.

He directly addressed himself to trade unions in Stratégie ouvrière et néocapitalisme in which he criticized capitalist economic growth and expounded on the various strategies open to trade unions. The same year he quit LExpress along with Serge Lafaurie Jacques-Laurent Bost K.S. Karol and Jean Daniel to found Le Nouvel Observateur weekly and used the pseudonym Michel Bosquet.

Deeply affected by May 1968 Gorz saw in the events a confirmation of his existential Marxist posture which joined the students criticisms towards institutional and state organisations state school damily firm etc. Ivan Illichs ideas on education medicine and the abolition of wage labour then became the focus of his attention. Gorz published one of Illichs speeches in Les Temps Modernes in 1961 and met him in 1971 in Le Nouvel Observateur at the publishing of Deschooling Society . Gorz later published a summary of Illichs Tools for Conviviality under the title Libérer lavenir . His links with Illich was strengthened after a trip to California in 1974 and he wrote several articles for Le Nouvel Observateur to discuss Illichs thesis.

Gorzs evolution and political and philosophical stances led to some tensions with his colleagues on Les Temps Modernes for which he had assumed the chief editorial responsibilities in 1969. In April 1970 his article Destroy the University provoked the resignations of Jean-Bertrand Pontalis and Bernard Pingaud. Gorz also criticised a Maoist tendency that had been in the journal since 1971 and supported by Sartre. In 1974 Gorz finally resigned as editor after a disagreement on an article about the Italian autonomist group Lotta Continua. He was also forced to the periphery of Le Nouvel Observateur since he was replaced by more classically-oriented economists and he supported a campaign against nuclear industry to which EDF the state electricity firm replied by withdrawing advertisements from the weekly. After it refused to let him publish a special issue on the nuclear issue he published it in the Que Choisir consumers magazine.

Gorz was becoming a leading figure of political ecology with his ideas being popularised particularly by the ecologist monthly Le Sauvage which had been founded by Alain Hervé the founder of the French section of the Friends of the Earth. In 1975 Gorz published Ecologie et politique which included the essay Ecologie et liberté one of the foundational texts of the ecologic problematic.

Gorz was also influenced by Louis Dumont in considering Marxism and liberalism to be two versions of economist thought. Gorz then opposed hedonist individualism and utilitarianism and materialist and productivist collectivism. He supported a humanist version of ecology similar to social ecology that opposes deep ecology. Gorzs ecologism however remained linked to a critique of capitalism as he called for an ecological social and cultural revolution that abolishes the constraints of capitalism.

A year before the election of the lefts candidate François Mitterrand to the French presidency in 1981 Gorz published Adieux au prolétariat in which he criticized the cult of the proletarian class in Marxism. He argued that changes in science and technology had made it impossible for the working class to be the sole or even the main revolutionary agent. Although the book was not well received among the French left it received attention from younger readers.

Soon after Sartres death that year Gorz left the editorial board of Les Temps Modernes. In Les Chemins du paradis Gorz remained critical of the Marxist orthodoxy of the time and he used Marxs own analysis in the Grundrisse to argue for the need of the political left to embrace the liberatory potential that the increasing automation of factories and services offered as a central part of the socialist project. In 1983 he fell out with pacifist movements by refusing to oppose the deployment of Pershing II missiles by the United States in West Germany. The same year he resigned from Le Nouvel Observateur.

In the 1990s and the 2000s the journals Multitudes and EcoRev published his last article in French La fin du capitalisme a déjà commencé and Entropia published his articles.

Gorz also opposed the post-structuralism and the postmodernism of thinkers like Antonio Negri. Gorzs point of view was rooted in the thought of early Marxist humanism. Liberation from wage slavery and social alienation remained some of his goals even in his later works.

He never became an abstract theorist since his reasoning usually concluded with proposals for how to act to make changes. In Métamorphoses du travail Gorz argued that capitalism used personal investments from the worker that were not paid back. As such he became an advocate of a guaranteed basic income independent from work. He made such a proposal in his book Critique of Economic Reason in 1989 and argued

Gorz and his wife Dorine committed suicide by lethal injection together in his home in Vosnon Aube. His wife had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and they had already said that neither wanted to survive the others death. Their bodies were found on 24 September 2007 by a friend.

His book Lettre à D. Histoire dun amour was dedicated to his wife and was in fact a way for him to tell of his love for her."
Henri Gouhier,"Henri Gouhier was a French philosopher a historian of philosophy and a literary critic.

Born in Auxerre Yonne Gouhiers studies led to a doctorate in 1926. He served as the Professor of philosophy at a lycée in Troyes from 1925 to 1928. Then he taught at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Lille between 1929 and 1940; subsequently he taught at the University of Bordeaux during 1940 and 1941.

Gouhier was a Professor at the Sorbonne for twenty-seven years from 1941 to 1968. In 1979 he was elected to the Académie française and in 1988 was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.

Gouhier supervised the undergraduate dissertation of famed sociologist Pierre Bourdieu a translation of and commentary on Leibnizs Animadversions."
Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville,"Jean-Baptiste François Xavier Cousin De Grainville was a French writer who wrote a seminal work of fantasy literature Le Dernier Homme . This was the first modern novel to depict the end of the world.

The son of an army staff officer de Grainville was born in Le Havre and was destined for the priesthood like his brother who became Bishop of Cahors. After attending school in Caen he attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. De Grainville was ordained a priest in 1766 but left the priesthood during the French Revolution. He committed suicide at Amiens in 1805 and his novel was published posthumously."
Gérard Granel,"Gérard Granel was a French philosopher and translator.

Born in Paris Granel attended the lycée Louis-le-Grand and the courses of Michel Alexandre Jean Hyppolite and later of Louis Althusser and Jean Beaufret. He taught in Bordeaux Toulouse and Aix before being appointed professor of philosophy at the Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail a position he held from 1972 until his death.

Granel translated numerous philosophical texts into French including work by Martin Heidegger Edmund Husserl David Hume Giambattista Vico and Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Granel was an important influence on a number of French philosophers including Jacques Derrida Jean-Luc Nancy and Bernard Stiegler."
Jean Grenier,"Jean Grenier was a French philosopher and writer. He taught for a time in Algiers where he became a significant influence on the young Albert Camus.

Born in Paris Grenier spent his childhood and adolescence in Saint-Brieuc Brittany the birthplace of Jules Lequier the visionary philosopher to whom Grenier would eventually dedicate his doctoral thesis. These early years during which he became acquainted with Louis Guilloux Edmond Lambert and Max Jacob are documented in his autobiographical novel Les grèves . In 1922 Grenier gained a teaching qualification in philosophy and began his academic career at the Institut français in Naples alongside Henri Bosco. He then spent some time working on the literary journal La Nouvelle Revue française before returning to teaching as a professor of philosophy in Algiers the capital of Algeria. Albert Camus became a student of Greniers and a close friendship developed between them. Strongly influenced by Les Îles which came out in 1933 Camus dedicated his first book to Grenier Lenvers et lendroit published in Algeria by Edmond Charlot. His Lhomme révolté was also dedicated to Grenier and Camus provided the preface to the second edition of Les Îles in 1959.

However the two thinkers followed very different ideological paths. While Camus was drawn to revolution and ultimately the desperate cries of La Chute Grenier was more contemplative adopting the Taoist principle of Wou-Wei and surreptitiously practising a quietist version of Christianity.

Greniers 1938 Essai sur lesprit dorthodoxie is essentially a distillation of his writings from 1936 and 1937. Although it tackles the burning issues of the day it was intended to be a reaction against them. This essay gave rise to a generation of intellectuals divided by their attitudes towards Communism.

Grenier was well known in the intellectual circles of the time and contributed to numerous literary journals including LŒil XXe Siècle and Preuves. A friend of Jean Paulhan he frequently wrote for the NRF. Grenier had an arts column in the newspaper Combat while Camus was editor and one in LExpress under Jean Daniel. Following a period of teaching in Alexandria and Cairo as well as teaching at the Faculty of Arts in Lille Grenier held a chair in aesthetics and science of art at the Sorbonne from 1962 to 1968.

Grenier was particularly interested in the development of non-figurative art and wrote mainly on the subject of contemporary painting including works such as Lesprit de la peinture contemporaine Essais sur la peinture contemporaine and Entretiens avec dix-sept peintres non-figuratifs. A summary of his reflections on the history of aesthetics written for his students at the Sorbonne may be found in Lart et ses problèmes.

Until his death in 1971 Grenier regularly published works dealing with a wide range of philosophical questions among them Le choix Entretiens sur le bon usage de la liberté Lesprit du Tao and Lexistence malheureuse. Somewhat more mundane topics included Sur la mort dun chien and La vie quotidienne. He filled notebooks with details of his relationships with Francine Camus René Char Louis Guilloux Jean Giono André Malraux and Manès Sperber and with the editorial team of the Nouvelle Nouvelle Revue française as well as his conversations with numerous contemporary artists who visited him at his home in Bourg-la-Reine. Towards the end he also wrote down some surprising definitions of technical terms and made some rather whimsical observations. In November 1968 just after the publication of Albert Camus souvenirs Grenier was awarded the Grand Prix national des lettres."
Bernard Groethuysen,"Bernard Groethuysen was a French writer and philosopher. His works which transgressed the confines of history and sociology concern the history of mentalities and representations and the interpretation of the experience of the world. In the interwar period he made the works of Hölderlin and Kafka and the sociology of Germany available in France.

Bernard Groethuysen was the second child of five. His mother Olga Groloff was part of a family of Russian immigrants. His father Philipp Groethuysen was a Dutch physician with a practice in Berlin. The elder Groethuysen suffered from psychiatric ailments and after 1885 lived in the sanitorium in Baden-Baden where he died in 1900. It was here that the younger Groethuysen completed his primary and secondary studies. He went on to study philosophy and history at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich.

Continuing work on Leibniz Groethuysen went to Paris in autumn 1904 where he met André Gide and Jean Paulhan and encountered Charles Du Bos whom he had met in Berlin some time before. Returning each year to the French capital he became a noteworthy messenger between German and French cultures. From 1912 he worked closely with Alix Guillain a Belgian Communist activist. Both settled in Paris in a small artists studio on rue Campagne-Première. In February 1915 after World War I broke out in France he was interned in Châteauroux at Bitray a camp reserved for foreign civilians and located in the premises of the insane asylum of the city. His friends Charles Du Bos Charles Andler and Henri Bergson petitioned to improve Groethuysens conditions of detention and finally persuaded the authorities to let him reside in private accommodations.

Beginning in 1924 Groethuysen participated each year in the Pontigny Decades held by Paul Desjardins at the Pontigny Abbey where Groethuysen had the opportunity to interact with French intellectuals such as Louis Aragon Julien Benda Léon Brunschvicg François Mauriac André Maurois Gabriel Marcel Roger Martin du Gard and Philippe Soupault. In 1926 he collaborated with Jean Paulhan on the Library of Ideas a collection published by in Éditions Gallimard that would soon become famous. Appointed professor in Germany in 1931 he fled before the rise of Nazism. He finished his last class with the words Intellectuals of all countries unite. In 1937 he acquired French citizenship and in 1938 was dismissed in absentia from the German University.

Groethuysens openness of spirit his appetite for knowledge and his generosity make him one of the great European intellectuals of the first half of the twentieth century. His translations of Goethes novels were published by Gallimard. He contributed to the introduction of Kafka in France writing a preface to Alexander Vialattes 1946 translation of The Trial. Lucien Herr saw Groethuysen as a sophist in the positive sense of the term. Jean Wahl found in Groethuysen a good European. Pierre Jean Jouve described him as an extraordinary man. Groethuysen died in 1946 at the Sainte-Élisabeth clinic in Luxembourg of lung cancer. Jean Paulhan wrote a very personal tribute.

Groethuysens works focused on the philosophy and politics of the eighteenth century particularly Montesquieu Rousseau and the French Revolution. Groethuysens 1913 treatise on Denis Diderot was particularly influential on the twentieth century reception of the encyclopedist."
Félix Guattari,"Pierre-Félix Guattari ; March 30 1930 August 29 1992 was a French psychoanalyst philosopher semiologist activist and screenwriter. He co-founded schizoanalysis with Gilles Deleuze and ecosophy with Arne Næss and is best known for his collaborations with Deleuze most notably Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia.

Guattari was born in Villeneuve-les-Sablons a working-class suburb of northwest Paris France. His father was a factory manager and he was engaged in Trotskyist activism as a teenager before studying for a pharmacology degree. He trained under the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan in the early 1950s. Subsequently he worked all his life at the experimental psychiatric clinic of La Borde under the direction of Lacans pupil the psychiatrist Jean Oury. He first met Oury at a private psychiatric clinic in Saumery in the Loire region at the suggestion of Ourys brother Fernand who had been Guattaris high school teacher. Guattari followed Oury to La Borde in 1955 two years after it had been established. La Borde was a venue for conversation among many students of philosophy psychology ethnology and social work.

One particularly novel orientation developed at La Borde consisted of the suspension of the classical analystanalysand pair in favour of an open confrontation in group therapy. In contrast to the Freudian schools individualistic style of analysis this practice studied the dynamics of several subjects in complex interaction. It led Guattari into a broader philosophical exploration of and political engagement with a vast array of intellectual and cultural domains .

From 1955 to 1965 Guattari edited and contributed to La Voie Communiste a Trotskyist newspaper. He supported anti-colonialist struggles as well as the Italian Autonomists. Guattari also took part in the G.T.P.S.I. which gathered many psychiatrists at the beginning of the sixties and created the Association of Institutional Psychotherapy in November 1965. It was at the same time that he founded along with other militants the F.G.E.R.I. and its review Recherche working on philosophy mathematics psychoanalysis education architecture ethnology etc. The F.G.E.R.I. came to represent aspects of the multiple political and cultural engagements of Guattari the Group for Young Hispanics the Franco-Chinese Friendships the opposition activities with the wars in Algeria and Vietnam the participation in the M.N.E.F. with the U.N.E.F. the policy of the offices of psychological academic aid the organization of the University Working Groups but also the reorganizations of the training courses with the Centers of Training to the Methods of Education Activities for psychiatric male nurses as well as the formation of a Fellowship of Nurses the studies on architecture and the projects of construction of a day hospital for students and young workers.

In 1967 he appeared as one of the founders of OSARLA . In 1968 Guattari met Daniel Cohn-Bendit Jean-Jacques Lebel and Julian Beck. He was involved in the large-scale French protests of 1968 starting from the Movement of March 22. It was in the aftermath of 1968 that Guattari met Gilles Deleuze at the University of Vincennes. Then he began to lay the groundwork for Anti-Oedipus which Michel Foucault described as an introduction to the non-fascist life in his preface to the book. In 1970 he created Center for the Study and Research of Institutional Formation which developed the approach explored in the Recherches journal. In 1973 Guattari was tried and fined for committing an outrage to public decency for publishing an issue of Recherches on homosexuality. In 1977 he created the CINEL for new spaces of freedom before joining in the 1980s the environmental movement with his ecosophy.

In his last book Chaosmosis Guattari returned to the question of subjectivity How to produce it collect it enrich it reinvent it permanently in order to make it compatible with mutant Universes of value This concern runs through all of his works from Psychoanalysis and Transversality through Years of Winter and Schizoanalytic Cartographies to his collaboration with Deleuze What is Philosophy . In Chaosmosis Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four functors material energetic and semiotic fluxes; concrete and abstract machinic phyla; virtual universes of value; and finite existential territories. This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity as Guattari understands it which include both signifying semiotic components as well as a-signifying semiological dimensions .

On 29 August 1992 two weeks after an interview for Greek television curated by Yiorgos Veltsos Guattari died in La Borde from a heart attack.

In 1995 the posthumous release of Guattaris Chaosophy published essays and interviews concerning Guattaris work as director of the experimental La Borde clinic and his collaborations with Deleuze. The collection includes essays such as Balance-Sheet Program for Desiring Machines cosigned by Deleuze and Everybody Wants To Be a Fascist. It provides an introduction to Guattaris theories on schizoanalysis a process that develops Sigmund Freuds psychoanalysis but which pursues a more experimental and collective approach towards analysis.

In 1996 another collection of Guattaris essays lectures and interviews Soft Subversions was published which traces the development of his thought and activity throughout the 1980s . His analyses of art cinema youth culture economics and power formations develop concepts such as micropolitics schizoanalysis and becoming-woman which aim to liberate subjectivity and open up new horizons for political and creative resistance to the standardizing and homogenizing processes of global capitalism in the post-media era. For example he used the term micropolitics to delimit a certain level of observation of social practices and practically to define in a segregated world the field of intervention of people who work to interest themselves in the discourse of the other.

Note Many of the essays found in these works have been individually translated and can be found in the English collections."
René Guénon,"René Guénon was a French intellectual who remains an influential figure in the domain of metaphysics having written on topics ranging from sacred science and traditional studies to symbolism and initiation.

In his writings he proposes either to expose directly some aspects of Eastern metaphysical doctrines these doctrines being defined by him as of universal character or to adapt these same doctrines for Western readers while keeping strictly faithful to their spirit; he only endorsed the act of handing down these Eastern doctrines while reiterating their non-human character. Initiated into Sufism from as early as 1910 he used his Sufi name of Abdel Wâhed Yahiâ publicly from 1930 onward.

René Guénon was born in Blois a city in central France approximately 160km from Paris. Guénon like most Frenchmen of the time was born into a Roman Catholic family originally from the Angevin Poitou and Touraine provinces in France; his father was an architect and he was very close to his mother and even more to his aunt Mme Duru a teacher who taught him to read and write two devout Catholics. By 1904 Guénon was living as a student in Paris where his studies focused on mathematics and philosophy. He was known as a brilliant student notably in mathematics in spite of his poor health. In Paris in 1905 due to his health problems he abandoned the preparation for the prestigious École Polytechnique and the École normale supérieure competitions. In 1906 on the same grounds he was exempted from conscription.

Guénon observed and became involved with some students who were at that time under the supervision of Papus. Guénon soon discovered that the Esoteric Christian Martinist order also supervised by Papus was irregular he wrote later that this occultist milieu had not received any authentic spiritual transmission. He joined the Gnostic Church founded by Léonce Fabre des Essarts . He did not take seriously this Gnostic church either but this allowed him under the name Tau Palingenius to become the founder and main contributor of a periodical review La Gnose writing articles for it until 1922 and focusing on oriental spiritual traditions .

From his incursions into the French occultist and pseudo-Masonic orders he despaired of the possibility of ever gathering these diverse and often ill-assorted doctrines into a stable edifice. In his book The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times he also pointed out what he saw as the intellectual vacuity of the French occultist movement which he wrote was utterly insignificant and more importantly had been compromised by the infiltration of certain individuals of questionable motives and integrity. Following his desire to join a regular Masonic obedience he became a member of the Thebah Lodge of the Grande Loge de France following the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.

Around this time it is possible that René Guénon became acquainted with Hinduism specifically via the initiatic lineage of Shankarâchârya and with Taoism due to his friendship with Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville alias Matgioi. Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville was initiated into Taoism in Tonkin by a village chief the Tong-Song-Luat . Paul Chacornac hypothesized that Guénon would also have received a direct transmission of Taoism via the younger son of the Master of Sentences Nguyen Van Cang who came to France with Matgioi and stayed for a while in Paris. Most biographers recognize that the encounter which marked his life and his work the most is that of Hindus one of whom at least played the role of instructor if not of spiritual master. This meeting took place very early during the period 19041909 probably upon his arrival in the occultist world if not before. He met Léon Champrenaud alias Abdul-Haqq and John-Gustav Ageli alias Abdul-Hadi who had been initiated by Abder-Rhaman el Kébir to Sufism in Cairo. Although René Guénon was initiated in 1910 to Islamic esotericism he himself insisted on recalling that the narrow and purely religious concept of conversion did not apply to his case. According to P. Chacornac Guénon thought that Islam was one of the traditional forms most accessible to Westerners while retaining authentic possibilities in the initiation domain. When he arrived in Cairo in 1930 his outward behavior had changed and he had completely immersed himself in the popular Muslim milieu of the city.. Guénon was initiated into the Sufi Shadhili order by Ivan Aguéli taking the name ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Yaḥyā.

Guénon discharged from his military service because of his health problems studied philosophy at the Sorbonne during World War I. In 1917 Guénon began a one-year stay at Sétif Algeria teaching philosophy to college students. After World War I he left teaching to dedicate his energies to writing; his first book Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines was published in 1921. From 1925 Guénon became a contributor to a review edited by P. Chacornac Le Voile dIsis ; after 1935 and under Guénons influence this periodical became known as Les Études Traditionnelles .

Although the exposition of Hindu doctrines to European audiences had already been attempted in piecemeal fashion at that time by many orientalists Guénons Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines advanced its subject in a uniquely insightful manner by referring to the concepts of metaphysics and Tradition in their most general sense which Guénon precisely defined along with the necessary distinctions and definitions of seemingly unambiguous terms such as religion tradition exoterism esoterism and theology. Guénon explained that his purpose was not to describe all aspects of Hinduism but to give the necessary intellectual foundation for a proper understanding of its spirit. The book also stands as a harsh condemnation of works presented by certain other European writers about Hinduism and Tradition in general; according to Guénon such writers had lacked any profound understanding of their subject matter and of its implications. The book also contains a critical analysis of the political intrusions of the British Empire into the subject of Hinduism through Madame Blavatskys Theosophy. The publication of this book earned him rapid recognition in Parisian circles.René Grousset in his History of Eastern Philosophy already referred to Guénons work as a classic. André Malraux would say much later that it was At its date a book capital. On the other hand Guénon was very disappointed by the reaction of his neo-Thomist friends Noëlle Maurice-Denis and his erstwhile supporter Jacques Maritain argued that Guénons views were radically irreconcilable with the faith; he called them a Hinduist restoration of ancient Gnosis mother of heresies. Jacques Maritain when he became French Ambassador to the Vatican after World War II asked for Guénons work listed under the Catholic Index of Prohibited Books a request which did not result due to the refusal of Pius XII and the support of Cardinal Eugène Tisserant.

In September 1920 Père Peillaube asked Guénon to write a book against the Theosophical Society. In 1921 Guénon debuted a series of articles in the French Revue de Philosophie which along with some supplements led to the book Theosophy History of a Pseudo-Religion. His critique of Theosophy was received positively by conservative Catholics. However his later book Orient et Occident distanced him from his Catholic supporters. During the decade 19201930 Guénon began to acquire a broader public reputation and his work was noted by various major intellectual and artistic figures both within and outside of Paris. Also at this time were published some of his books explaining the intellectual divide between the East and West and the peculiar nature according to him of modern civilization Crisis of the Modern World and East and West. In 1927 was published the second major doctrinal book of his works Man and His Becoming according to the Vedânta and in 1929 Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power. The last book listed offers a general explanation of what Guénon saw as the fundamental differences between sacerdotal and royal powers along with the negative consequences arising from the usurpation of the prerogatives of the latter with regard to the former. From these considerations René Guénon traces to its source the origin of the modern deviation which according to him is to be found in the destruction of the Templar order in 1314.

In 1930 Guénon left Paris for Cairo and he blended definitively into the Muslim world. During his lengthy sojourn in Egypt René Guénon carried on an austere and simple life entirely dedicated to his writings. First he lived for 7 years in various places in the medieval Judeo-Islamic quarters around the Khan el-Khalili and al-Azhar University one of the most important intellectual centers of the Sunni Muslim world. He sought in 1930 to meet Sheikh Abder-Rahman Elish El-Kebir the master of the Sufi spiritual lineage to which he was affiliated but he had just passed away and he could only meditate on his grave. He met Sheikh Salâma Râdi then the pole the highest authority since the death of Abder-Rahman Elish El-Kebir of the Shâdhilite branch to which Guénon belonged. They exchanged on questions spiritual experiences and several testimonies attest that Guénon became his disciple.

He met one morning at dawn while he was praying like every day at the Seyidna el Hussein mosque in front of the mausoleum housing the head of Husayn ibn Ali Sheikh Mohammad Ibrahim with whom he became very close. Guénon married Ibrahims youngest daughter in 1934 with whom he had four children. In 1937 thanks to the generosity of an English admirer John Levy the couple became owners of a small villa the Villa Fatma named after the wife in the modern district of Duqqi west of Cairo at the foot of the pyramids. Guénon hardly ever went out and often refused Western visitors . He spent most of his time working in his office and praying in his oratory.

In 1949 he obtained Egyptian citizenship. Sedgwick wrote about Guénons life in Egypt that even though he continued his interest in Hinduism and other religions Guénons own practice was purely Islamic. He is not known ever to have recommended anyone to become a Hindu whereas he introduced many to Islam.

Urged on by some of his friends and collaborators Guénon agreed to establish a new Masonic Lodge in France founded upon his Traditional ideals purified of what he saw as the inauthentic accretions which so bedeviled other lodges he had encountered during his early years in Paris. This lodge was called La Grande Triade a name inspired by the title of one of Guénons books. The first founders of the lodge however separated a few years after its inception. Nevertheless this lodge belonging to the Grande Loge de France remains active today.

René Guénon died on Sunday January 7 1951; his final word was Allah.

In 1921 Guénon published his first book an Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines. His goal as he writes it is an attempt at presenting to westerners eastern metaphysics and spirituality as they are understood and thought by easterners themselves while pointing at what René Guénon describes as all the erroneous interpretations and misunderstandings of western orientalism and neospiritualism . Right from that time he presents a rigorous understanding not only of Hindu doctrines but also of eastern metaphysics in general.

As David Bisson explains in addition to what concerns the definition of Tradition René Guénons work is generally divided into four major themes

Guénons writings make use of words and terms of fundamental signification which receive a precise definition throughout his books. These terms and words although receiving a usual meaning and being used in many branches of human sciences have according to René Guénon lost substantially their original signification . He insisted notably on the danger represented by the perversion of the signification of words seen by him as essential for the study of metaphysics.

The exposition of metaphysical doctrines which forms the cornerstone of Guénons work consists of the following books

Introduction to the Study of the Hindu Doctrines published in 1921 on topics which were later included in the lecture he gave at the Sorbonne on December 17 1925 consists of four parts.

The first part exposes the hurdles that prevented classical orientalism from a deep understanding of eastern doctrines the classical prejudice which consists essentially in a predisposition to attribute the origin of all civilization to the Greeks and Romans the ignorance of certain types of relationships between the ancient peoples linguistic difficulties and the confusions arising about certain questions related to chronology these confusions being made possible through the ignorance of the importance of oral transmission which can precede to a considerable and indeterminate extent the written formulation. A fundamental example of that latter mistake being found in the orientalists attempts at providing a precise birth date to the Vedas sacred scriptures.

The general characters of eastern thought part focuses on the principles of unity of the eastern civilizations and on the definition of the notions of tradition and metaphysics. Guénon also proposes a rigorous definition of the term religion and states the proper differences between tradition religion metaphysics and philosophical system. The relations between metaphysics and theology are also explored and the fundamental terms of esoterism and exoterism are introduced. A chapter is devoted to the idea of metaphysical realization. The first two parts state according to Guénon the necessary doctrinal foundations for a correct understanding of Hindu doctrines.

The Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines had among its objectives the purpose of giving the proper intellectual basis to promote openness to the study of eastern intellectuality. The study of Hindu doctrines is continued in his book Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta. There he described a part of the doctrine of Vêdânta according to the formulation of Adi Shankara focusing on the human being his constitution his states his posthumous future the purpose of existence being presented as identity with the Self. the transcendent principle of being identical to Brahma. The Self is the essence the transcendent Principle of being the human being for example. He specifies that Personality comes under the order of universal principles pure metaphysics has for its domain the Universal which is without common measure with the domain of the general and of what is designated by the term of categories in philosophy.

In the history of Western thought only the transcendentals of scholastic theology belong to the Universal. The Self contains all the states of manifestation but also all the states of non-manifestation. If one considers the Self only as the principle of manifested states only it identifies with Ishvara the notion closest to the Creator God in Hindu doctrines according to him. All manifested states represent manifestation or Universal Existence where everything is related. Nothing can fundamentally be isolated from the rest of the manifestation there is oneness of Existence. Nothing can fundamentally be isolated from the rest of the manifestation there is oneness of Existence. Like the principle of manifestation the Being is One. He then sets out the purpose of human existence the realization of identity with the Self understood as the true essence of the human being. He adds that the Self resides in the vital center of the human being symbolized by the heart. According to Guénon according to all spiritual traditions the heart is the seat of Intelligence understood as supra-rational knowledge the only form of knowledge allowing Supreme Identity. This supra-rational knowledge is Buddhi the higher intellect introduced by Guénon in chapter VII of his book. For its part the brain is the instrument of the mind in particular of rational thought indirect knowledge. It is Buddhi who resides in the heart of every being who ensures the unification between all the states of existence and the oneness of Existence.

The book contains many quotes from Shankara and some parallels with Jewish Kabbalah and Christianity. The rigor and quality of the presentation refer to the quality of the Hindu master whom Guénon had met during the period 1905-1909 and about whom he does not breathe a word in his book some supposed that he must have studied the texts cited directly with these Hindus. The book was very well received and was the subject of many glowing reviews in the press on the right and on the left sometimes in newspapers with very large circulation.Paul Claudel spoke about the book placing it next to those of Sylvain Lévi and René Grousset and the Islamologist Louis Massignon wanted to meet Guénon the meeting took place that year .

Paul Chacornac quotes a letter from Roger de Pasquier It was not until 1949 during a stay in Bénarès that I learned of René Guénons work. It had been recommended to me to read by Alain Danielou who had submitted Guénons works to orthodox pundits. The verdict of these was clear of all the Westerners who dealt with Hindu doctrines only Guénon they said really understood the meaning . The academic Michel Hulin a specialist in Indian philosophy wrote in 2001 that Man and his future according to the Vedânta remains one of the most rigorous and profound interpretations of the Shankarian doctrine.

The Symbolism of the Cross is a book dedicated to the venerated memory of Esh-Sheikh Abder-Rahman Elish El-Kebir. Its goal as Guénon states it is to explain a symbol that is common to almost all traditions a fact that would seem to indicate its direct attachment to the great primordial tradition. To alleviate the hurdles bound to the interpretations of a symbol belonging to different traditions Guénon distinguishes synthesis from syncretism syncretism consists in assembling from the outside a number of more or less incongruous elements which when so regarded can never be truly unified. Syncretism is something outward the elements taken from any of its quarters and put together in this way can never amount to anything more than borrowings that are effectively incapable of being integrated into a doctrine worthy of that name. To apply these criteria to the present context of the symbolism of the cross

A notable example of syncretism can be found according to Guénon in the doctrines and symbols of the Theosophical society. Synthesis on the other hand is carried essentially from within by which it properly consists in envisaging things in the unity of their principle. Synthesis will exist when one starts from unity itself and never loses sight of it throughout the multiplicity of its manifestations; this moreover implies the ability to see beyond forms and an awareness of the principal truth. Given such awareness one is at liberty to make use of one or another of those forms something that certain traditions symbolically denote as the gift of tongues. The concordance between all traditional forms may be said to represent genuine synonymies. In particular René Guénon writes that the cross is a symbol that in its various forms is met with almost everywhere and from the most remotes times. It is therefore far from belonging peculiarly to the Christian tradition and the cross like any other traditional symbol can be regarded according to manifold senses.

Far from being an absolute and complete unity in himself the individual in reality constitutes but a relative and fragmentary unity. The multiplicity of the states of the being which is a fundamental metaphysical truth implies the effective realization of the beings multiple states and is related to the conception that various traditional doctrines including Islamic esoterism denote by the term Universal Man in Arabic al-Insân-al-kâmil is at the same time Primordial man ; it is the Adam Qadmon of the Hebrew Kabbalah; it is also the King of the Far-Eastern tradition . The conception of the Universal Man establishes a constitutive analogy between universal manifestation and its individual human modality or to use the language of Western Hermeticism between the macrocosm and the microcosm.

From these considerations the geometrical symbolism of the cross in its most universal signification can be contemplated most traditional doctrines symbolize the realization of Universal Man by a sign that is everywhere the same because according to Guénon it is one of those directly attached to the primordial tradition. That sign is the sign of the cross which very clearly represents the manner of achievement of this realization by the perfect communion of all states of the being harmoniously and conformably ranked in integral expansion in the double sense of amplitude and exaltation.

This book expands on the multiple states of Being a doctrine already tackled in The Symbolism of the Cross leaving aside the geometrical representation exposed in that book to bring out the full range of this altogether fundamental theory.First and foremost is asserted the necessity of the metaphysical Infinity envisaged in its relationship with universal Possibility. The Infinite according to the etymology of the term which designates it is that which has no limits so it can only be applied to what has absolutely no limit and not to what is exempted from certain limitations while being subjected to others like space time quantity in other words all countless other things that fall within the indefinite fate and nature. There is no distinction between the Infinite and universal Possibility simply the correlation between these terms indicates that in the case of the Infinite it is contemplated in its active aspect while the universal Possibility refers to its passive aspect these are the two aspects of Brahma and its Shakti in the Hindu doctrines. From this results that the distinction between the possible and the real has no metaphysical validity for every possible is real in its way according to the mode befitting its own nature. This leads to the metaphysical consideration of the Being and Non-Being

If we define Being in the universal sense as the principle of manifestation and at the same time as comprising in itself the totality of possibilities of all manifestation we must say that Being is not infinite because it does not coincide with total Possibility; and all the more so because Being as the principle of manifestation although it does indeed comprise all the possibilities of manifestation does so only insofar as they are actually manifested. Outside of Being therefore are all the rest that is all the possibilities of non-manifestation as well as the possibilities of manifestation themselves insofar as they are in the unmanifested state; and included among these is Being itself which cannot belong to manifestation since it is the principle thereof and in consequence is itself unmanifested. For want of any other term we are obliged to designate all that is thus outside and beyond Being as Non-Being but for us this negative term is in no way synonym for nothingness.

For instance our present state in its corporeal modality is defined by five conditions space time matter form and life and these five conditions enter into correlation with the five corporeal elements to create all living forms in our world and state of existence. But the universal Manifestation is incommensurably more vast including all the states of existence that correspond to other conditions or possibilities yet Being Itself is the principle of universal Manifestation.

This involves the foundation of the theory of multiple states and the metaphysical notion of the Unicity of the Existence as it is for instance developed in Islamic esoterism by Mohyddin Ibn Arabi. The relationships of unity and multiplicity lead to a more accurate description of the Non-Being in it there can be no question of a multiplicity of states since this domain is essentially that of the undifferentiated and even of the unconditionned the undifferentiated cannot exist in a distinctive mode although we still speak analogously of the states of the non-manifestation Non-Being is Metaphysical Zero and is logically anterior to unity; that is why Hindu doctrine speaks in this regard only of non duality . Analogous considerations drawn from the study of dream state help understand the relationships of unity and multiplicity in dream state which is one of the modalities of the manifestation of the human being corresponding to the subtle part of its individuality the being produces a world that proceeds entirely from itself and the objects therein consist exclusively of mental images that is to say of combinations of ideas clothed in subtle forms that depend substantially of the subtle form of the individual himself moreover of which the imaginal objects of a dream are nothing but accidental and secondary modifications. Then René Guénon studies the possibilities of individual consciousness and the mental as the characteristic element of the human individuality. In chapter X he comes back to the notion of metaphysical realization . A superior signification of the notion of darkness is then introduced most notably in the chapter entitled The two chaoses which describes what is happening during the course of spiritual realization when a disciple leaves the domain of formal possibilities. The multiples states of the Being is essentially related to the notion of spiritual hierarchies which is found in all traditions. Hence is described the universal process of the realization of the Being through Knowledge.

Guénon gave a conference at La Sorbonne on December 17 1925. This conference was organized by the group of Philosophical and Scientific Studies for the Examination of New Ideas founded by Doctor René Allendy. The objective of this association was to reflect on a European union based on overcoming national rivalries and to promote rapprochement between the East and the West. Guénon repeatedly explained that a union could only be based on a restoration of true intellectuality which alone could transcend the differences between cultures and this is the reason why he clarified what he called by real intellectuality during his speech. The Sorbonne conference was published in several parts in the journal Vers Unité in 1926 and then in book form in 1939.

During the conference Guénon clarified what he called by true intellectuality and by metaphysics. These points were essential for the constitution of a spiritual elite which aimed to reconstitute a union between the peoples. He explained that metaphysics literally means that which is beyond physics i.e. what is beyond nature. He insisted on the fact that this requires going beyond the manifested world and therefore all phenomena. Metaphysics therefore has nothing to do with phenomena even with extraordinary phenomena. Metaphysics must go beyond the domain of being and must therefore go beyond ontology. He added metaphysics is supra-rational intuitive . But he clarified all this cannot go far without the most important means which is the concentration. Guénon then described the different stages of the spiritual path

In his Introduction to the Study of Hindu Doctrines Guénon writes that metaphysics affirms the identity of knowing and being and that it does not only affirm it it realizes it. The effective means of realization are found in what is called initiation. Articles written by him on this subject were collected later in the form of two books including Perspectives on Initiation and Initiation and Spiritual Realization .

Guénon declared that the path to this knowledge requires only one essential preparation and that is theoretical knowledge . But he clarified all this cannot go far without the most important means which is concentration. The rational study of the initiatory texts and the implementation of the rites are of no use if the spiritual transmission has not taken place for example the recitation of a mantra is useless without the spiritual influence transmitted by the master during the initiation. One cannot initiate oneself alone or in astral for Guénon any desire to revive dead traditions has no meaning. The spiritual laws which govern the spiritual path have nothing to do with the magic or the paranormal phenomena which concern the psychic and not the spiritual to be attached to these phenomena is an obstacle to the spiritual development. Guénon considers imperative the need to combine esotericism with the corresponding exoterism and not to mix the practices of different traditions one must practice only one spiritual path 

Perspectives on Initiation first published at the close of World War II in 1946 extends a series of articles on the central subject of initiation originally written between 1932 and 1938 for Le Voile dIsis . Initiation is introduced as the transmission by the appropriate rites of a given tradition of a spiritual influence. Related articles were later published in 1952 in the posthumous collection Initiation and Spiritual Realization. While the notion of initiation is introduced in the most general setting it is impossible writes Guénon to write a complete and comprehensive book on the subject for an indefinite number of questions could be raised the very nature of the subject resisting any set limit. However the subject of initiation being contemplated from a general point of view the goal of Guénon goes beyond an introduction to the subject and doing so to make clear distinctions between what is relevant to initiation and what is not according to Guénon. First in particular he insists on clarifying his position on the essential differences between mysticism and initiation so that to him initiation is by its very nature incompatible with mysticism

In the case of mysticism the individual simply limits himself to what is presented to him and to the manner in which it is presented having himself no say in the matter In the case of initiation on the contrary the individual is the source of initiative towards realization pursued methodically under rigorous and unremitting control and normally reaching beyond the very possibilities of the individual as such.

For Guénon there are traditions where the esotericexoteric separation does not exist so much esotericism permeates everything. In China the two are totally separate . The two overlap in Islam and Judaism . In the West Guénon claims that Christianity had a strong esoteric character at its origin but that to save the Roman world it exteriorized itself in a providential way the Christian sacraments then went from esoteric to exoteric status. In the Middle Ages Christian initiation groups existed the most important was the order of the Temple. After the destruction of this order Christian esotericism became more and more closed and separated from the official Church. Freemasonry and Compagnonnage inherited the last Western initiation rites. For Guénon the Catholic Church has retained its authentic religious dimension but has lost its esoteric dimension no longer making access to final deliverance possible. Mysticism since the Renaissance is a passive path inferior to the initiatory path it allows to reach the divine but in an indirect and often uncontrollable way. Freemasonry has kept initiatory transmissions but in addition to the fact that it is about low initiations its passage from operative masonry to speculative masonry in the 18th century prevents the transition from virtual initiation to effective initiation the latter had to be done by exercising the profession in question. More seriously still Masonry turned in part from its initiatory role in the 19th century to devote itself to politics in a more anti-traditional direction. Guénon has long kept the hope of an alliance between some members of the Catholic Church and Masonry to reconstitute a complete elite . He envisioned that Eastern masters could spiritually revive these traditions from time to time.

The application of the distinction between esotericism and exoterism to Christianity Guénons position on mysticism and the assertion that the Catholic sacraments have lost their initiatory character have been the subject of strong criticism. It is this point which led to the rupture between Guénon and Frithjof Schuon. Guénons ideas on esotericism had a significant impact on Freemasonry especially in Latin speaking countries. According to David Bisson the redefinition of esotericism by René Guénon is considered as an essential chapter in the history of Western esotericism - as it is conceived and developed by Antoine Faivre the latter emphasized the importance of Guénon and the currents that claim to be based on his notion of Tradition in the esoteric Western currents.

On the subject of initiation Guénon clarifies the signification given by the ancient Greeks to the classical names of lesser and greater mysteries they are not different types of initiations but stages or degrees of a same initiation. Lesser mysteries lead to the perfection of the human state in other words to something traditionally designated by the restoration of the primordial state a state that Dante in the Divine comedy relates symbolically to the terrestrial paradise. On another hand greater mysteries refer properly to the realization of supra-human states; they correspond to the Hindu doctrine of deliverance and to what Islamic esoterism calls the realization of the Universal Man in that latter tradition lesser and greater mysteries correspond exactly to the signification of the terms el-insân el-qadîm and el-insan el-kâmil . These two phases are related to an interpretation of the symbolism of the cross with the notions of horizontal and vertical realization. They also correspond respectively to what is traditionally designated in western hermeticism by the terms royal initiation and sacerdotal initiation.

Guénon introduces some preliminary aspects of a particular cosmological science the Hindu doctrine of cosmic cycles for instance in the article Some remarks on the doctrine of cosmic cycles. He writes that giving an overview of this theory and its equivalents in different traditional forms is merely an impossible task not only because the question is very complex in itself but specially owing to the extreme difficulty of expressing these things in a European language and in a way that is intelligible to the present-day Western mentality which has had no practice whatsoever with this kind of thinking. All that is possible in this respect is to clarify a few points with remarks which can only raise suggestions about the meaning of the doctrine in question rather than really explaining it.

In the most general sense of the term a cycle must be considered as representing the process of development of some state of manifestation or in the case of minor cycles of one of the more or less restricted and specialized modalities of that state. Moreover in virtue of the law of correspondence which links all things in universal Existence there is necessarily and always a certain analogy either among the different cycles of the same order or among the principal cycles and their secondary divisions. This allows to use one and the same mode of expression when speaking about the cycles although this must often be understood only symbolically and this allude here especially to the chronological form under which the doctrine of cycles is presented since a Kalpa represents the total development of a world that is to say of a state or degree of universal existence it is obvious that one cannot speak literally about its duration computed according to some temporal measure unless this duration relates to a state of which time is one of the determination as in our world. Everywhere else this duration is only purely symbolic and must be transposed analogically for temporal succession is only an image both logical and ontological of extra-temporal series of causes and effects.

The Yugas are the divisions of the Manvantara and they are four in number which correspond in the spatial symbolism to the four cardinal points. There is an obvious equivalence with the four Yugas and the four ages of gold silver bronze and iron of the Greco-Latin antiquity. Guénon writes that the figures given as durations of the Yugas in various Indian texts are to be taken symbolically their actual exact determination needs in-depth and specific knowledge as these numbers are often written for various traditional reasons with an undetermined number of zeros added to their transcription. Guénon gives indications for the determination of the Yugas durations if the total duration of the Manvantara is represented by 10 then the durations of the four Yugas are

But given the character of the Arabic language the primary and fundamental meaning a of word is to be found in the numerical values of the letters; and in fact what is particularly remarkable is that the sum of the numerical values of the letters which form the word sūfi has the same number as al-Hikmatul-ilahiya Divine Wisdom. The true sūfi is therefore the one who possesses this Wisdom or in other words he is al-arif bi Llah that is to say he who knows through God for God cannot be known except by Himself and this is the supreme or total degree of knowledge or haqiqah.

Guénon then introduces the symbolism used in taṣawwūf about the numerical signification of Arabic letters

The divine Throne which surrounds all worlds is represented by the figure of a circle. In the center is ar-Rūh and the Throne is supported by eight angels positionned on the circumference the first four at the four cardinal points and the other four at four intermediary points. The names of these angels are formed by various groups of letters arranged according to their numeric values in such a way that taken together the names comprise all the letters of the alphabet. The alphabet in question has 28 letters but it is said that at the very beginning the Arabic alphabet had only 22 letters corresponding exactly to those of the Hebrew alphabet; in doing so the distinction is made between the lesser jafr which uses only 22 letters and the greater jafr which uses 28 and conceives of them all with distinct numerical values. Moreover it can be said that 28 is contained in 22 as 10 is contained in 4 according to Pythagorean Tetraktys 1 2 3 4 10 and in fact the six supplementary letters are only modifications of the original six letters from which they are formed by a simple addition of a dot and to which they are restored immediately by the suppression of this same dot.

It will be noticed that each of the two groups of four names contains exactly half of the alphabet or 14 letters which are distributed respectively in the following fashion 

The numeric values of the eight names formed from the sum of those of their letters are taking them naturally in order

The values of the last three names are equal to those of the first three multiplied by 100 which is clear enough if one notices that the first three contain the numbers from 1 to 10 and the last three the hundred from 100 to 1000 both groups being equally distributed into 4 3 3.

The value of the first half of the alphabet is the sum of those of the first four names 10 18 27 140 195. Similarly that of the second half is the sum of the last four names 300 1000 1800 2700 5800. Finally the total value of the entire alphabet is 195 5800 5995.

The doctrine of five elements which plays an important role in some Vedic texts in Advaita Vedanta Islamic esotericism the Hebrew Kabbalah in Christian Hermeticism and other traditions is partially exposed by René Guénon in two articles one entitled The conditions of corporeal existence published in 1912 in the journal La Gnose and another published much later in 1935 The Hindu doctrine of five elements . A missing part of the first article was never published but René Guénon announced several times his intention to write a more complete study on this issue. Some aspects of the doctrine of five elements and conditions are used at many occurrences in all his work in The symbolism of the cross The principles of infinitesimal calculus The Great Triad in the first two chapters of The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times etc. However Guénon never wrote a comprehensive introduction to the subject something that prompted comments from some authors.

Classical elements; ether would be located at the centre the other bhutas originate from it.

In these two articles he exposits the doctrine of elements and the conditions of corporeal existence starting from the considerations taken from Samkhya of Kapila. The five elements or bhutas are the elementary substances of the corporeal world. The names given to them in the Latin language are purely symbolic and they should not be confused with the things they designate we could consider the elements as different vibratory modalities of physical matter modalities under which it makes itself perceptible successively to each of the senses of our corporeal modality. The five bhutas are in their order of production 

The five bhutas combine with the five conditions of corporeal existence which are

In the article The conditions of corporeal existence he develops for the first two bhutas how they are related to the measurement of time and space and in The Hindu theory of the five elements the predominance of the three gunas or essential qualities coextensive with the universal manifestation in each of them serves to define the geometric representation of the sphere of the elements.

In its true sense of indivisible writes Guénon an atom having no parts must be without extension and the sum of elements devoid of extension can never form an extension so that atoms cannot make up bodies. Guénon also reproduces an argument coming from Shankaracharya for the refutation of atomism

The issue will be included in The principles of the infinitesimal calculus in relation to the concept of a whole understood as logically prior to its parts as well as in the conditions of corporeal existence and The symbolism of the cross.In that latter book he speaks of the elementary distance between two points and in The principles of infinitesimal calculus he states that the ends of a segment are no longer in the domain of extension. Applied to the corporeal world this leads to introduce the limits of spatial possibility by which divisibility is conditioned and to consider the atoms not in the corporeal world . The process of quintuplication of the elements being universal and coextensive to the whole manifestation a universalization is contemplated in The conditions of corporeal existence

The conditions of corporeal existence in Miscellanea pp. 97 98.

In particular and in relation to these matters The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times develops against the theories of Descartes about the nature of time.

While it is acknowledged that symbolism refers to something very different from a mere code an artificial or arbitrary meaning and that it holds an essential and spontaneous echoing power for René Guénon this echoing power goes immensely farther than the psychological realm symbolism is the metaphysical language at its highest capable of relating all degrees of universal Manifestation and all the components of the Being as well symbolism is the means by which man is capable of assenting orders of reality that escape by their very nature any description by ordinary language. This understanding of the profound nature of symbolism writes René Guénon has never been lost by an intellectual elite in the East. It is inherent in the transmission of initiation which he says gives the real key to man to penetrate the deeper meaning of the symbols; in this perspective meditation on symbols is an integral part both of initiation and of spiritual realization.

For René Guénon art is above all knowledge and understanding rather than merely a matter of sensitivity. Similarly the symbolism has a conceptual vastness not exclusive to a mathematical rigor symbolism is before all a science and it is based in its most general signification on connections that exist between different levels of reality . And in particular the analogy itself understood following a formula used in Hermeticism as the relation of what is down with what is above is likely to be symbolized there are symbols of the analogy . The analogical relation essentially involves the consideration of an inverse direction of its two terms and symbols of the analogy which are generally built on the consideration of the primitive six-spoke wheel also called the chrism in the Christian iconography indicate clearly the consideration of these inverse directions; in the symbol of the Solomons seal the two triangles in opposition represent two opposing ternaries one of which is like a reflection or mirror image the other and this is where this symbol is an exact representation of analogy.

The importance of symbolism in the works of René Guénon arises because symbolism is in his own words the metaphysical language at its highest; it may be used to link concepts with different formulations in different traditions. Among many other examples found in his works symbolism is used in The Great Triad to connect the Operation of the Holy Spirit in the generation of Jesus Christ to the non-acting activity of Purusha or Heaven and Prakriti or the Universal Substance to Mary of Nazareth Christ henceforth becoming identical according to this symbolism to the Universal Man. His book The Symbolism of the Cross also connects the symbol of the Cross with the data of Islamic esotericism.

Guénon was critical of modern interpretations regarding symbolism which often rested on naturalistic interpretations of the symbol in question which Guénon regarded as a case of the symbol of the thing being mistaken for the thing itself. He was also critical of the psychological interpretations found in the likes of Carl Jung.

In the East writes René Guénon symbolism is above all a matter of knowledge. He therefore devotes a substantial number of writings in an exhibition of traditional symbols. Most of these articles have been collected by Michel Valsan in the posthumous work Fundamentals symbols of Sacred Science which proposes in a remarkable synthesis numerous keys aimed at interpreting a considerable number of symbols especially prehistoric symbols of the Center of the World the Baetylus the axial symbols symbols of the heart of cyclic manifestation etc. According to Guénon the existence of identical symbols in different traditional forms remote in time or space would be a clue to a common intellectual and spiritual source whose origins dating back to the primordial Tradition.

Guénon denounced the Theosophical Society many pseudo-Masonic orders in the French and English occult scenes and the Spiritist movement. They formed the topic of two of his major books written in the 1920s Theosophy History of a Pseudo-Religion and The Spiritist Fallacy. He denounced the syncretic tendencies of many of these groups along with the common Eurocentric misconceptions that accompanied their attempts to interpret Eastern doctrines. René Guénon especially develops some aspects of what he refers to as the manifestation of antitraditional currents in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His first book on that subject is devoted to a detailed historical examination of Madame Blavatskys theosophy Theosophy History of a Pseudo-Religion. Guénon examines the role and intervention that played in that movement organizations that are described in more detail in The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times as under what he called the pseudo-initiation; in particular what he calls pseudo-Rosicrucian organizations holding no affiliation with the real authentic Rosicrucians like the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little the Order of the esoteric Rose-Cross of Dr. Franz Hartmann etc. He denounces the syncretic nature of theosophy and its connection with the theory of evolution in The Secret Doctrine ; he also examines the role and relationship that the Theosophical Society had with multitude of pseudo-initiatic organizations among others the O.T.O. founded in 1895 by Carl Kellner and propagated in 1905 by Theodor Reuss and the Golden Dawn to which belongs a large number of key figures of the Anglo-Saxon neo-spiritualism of the early twentieth century etc. Some authors have argued that Guénons analysis of Theosophy is flawed and that it is debatable whether Theosophy is really hostile to Islam and Christianity.

These are precisely some members of the inner circle of the H.B. of L. to which belonged Emma Hardinge Britten who would have produced the phenomena giving rise to spiritist movement that is to say another antitraditional current born in 1848. To support this assertion he relies on statements from Emma Hardinge Britten herself which will be confirmed much later in 1985 by the publication from French publishing house Editions Archè of the documents of the H.B. of L. This organization would have received in part the legacy of other secret societies including the Eulis Brotherhood to which belonged Paschal Beverly Randolph a character designated by René Guénon as very enigmatic who died in 1875. He denounces the confusion of the psychic and the spiritual and especially the psychoanalytic interpretation of symbols including the Jungian branch of it which he condemned with the greatest firmness seeing in it the beginnings of a reversed or at least distorted interpretation of symbols. This aspect is reflected in some studies especially in a book published in 1999 by Richard Noll who incidentally speaks of the role played by the Theosophical Society in Jung.

A commentator of René Guénon Charles-André Gilis has published a book in 2009 which proposes some insights and developments of the idea of counter-tradition introduced by Guénon based on Mohyddin Ibn Arabis writings .

Martial Gueroult,"Martial Gueroult was a French philosopher. His primary areas of research were in 17th- and 18th-century philosophy as well as the history of philosophy.

Gueroult was born on 15 December 1891 in the city of Le Havre in northwestern France. A veteran of both the First and Second World Wars he was awarded the Légion dHonneur .

Gueroults first academic appointment was to the University of Strasbourg. In the 1930s Gueroult spent some time at the University of São Paulo in Brazil where he worked along with other French intellectuals such as Roger Bastide Claude Lévi-Strauss Pierre Monbeig and Ferdinand Braudel to develop the newly founded universitys social science programs. He would return to France to accept a position at the Sorbonne but in 1951 was named successor to Étienne Gilson at the Collège de France. Gueroult re-titled his position as Histoire et technologie des systèmes philosophiques and it is here he would remain until his retirement in 1962.

Gueroults work was characterized by a close attention to the History of Philosophy---which he considered as noble as philosophy itselfas well as a strong demand for systematicity. He also refused philosophical recourse to transcendence. A polemical debate opposed him to Ferdinand Alquié concerning Descartes as Gueroult was studying him according to the order of reasons while Alquié was more interested in his historical evolution studying him diachronically. Gueroult was interested in the conditions of possibility of a history of philosophy in general. He died before completing his opus titled Dianoématique which was composed of two books the first one being titled History of the history of philosophy and the second one Philosophy of the history of philosophy. The second volume asked the question how is a history of philosophy possible given that philosophy aims as studying eternal truths and that history is a school of skepticism

Gueroults influence has primarily been confined to France where his works have come to be seen as classics in the history of philosophy. He was highly influential on the thought of 20th-century French thinkers such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty Jules Vuillemin Michel Foucault Pierre Bourdieu Gilles Deleuze and Geneviève Rodis-Lewis."
Jean Guitton,"Jean Guitton was a French Catholic philosopher and theologian.

Born in Saint-Étienne Loire he studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and was accepted at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1920. His principal religious and intellectual influence was from a blind priest Francois Pouget. He finished his philosophical studies in the early 1920s and later became a professor in many French universities. During World War II he was made a war prisoner by the Nazis. In the year 1954 he earned a literary award from the Académie française. From 1955 to 1968 he continued his works as a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne. He became a member of the Académie française in 1961.

Invited as an observer to the ecumenical council of Vatican II the first lay person to be granted this honor he would become a close friend of Pope Paul VI.

He died in Paris at 97. During his life he was also awarded the Great Cross of the National Order of Merit Commander of the Légion dHonneur and of the Arts and Letters Medal.

In most of his works Jean Guitton writes about and discusses the agnostic confrontation between human faith and human logic. He wrote around fifty books."
Jean-Marie Guyau,"Jean-Marie Guyau was a French philosopher and poet.

Guyau was inspired by the philosophies of Epicurus Epictetus Plato Immanuel Kant Herbert Spencer and Alfred Fouillée and the poetry and literature of Pierre Corneille Victor Hugo and Alfred de Musset.

Guyau was first exposed to Plato and Kant as well as the history of religions and philosophy in his youth through his stepfather the noted French philosopher Alfred Fouillée. With this background he was able to attain his Bachelor of Arts at only 17 years of age and at this time translated the Handbook of Epictetus. At 19 he published his 1300-page Mémoire that a year later in 1874 won a prize from the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and helped to earn him a philosophy lectureship at the Lycée Condorcet. However this was short-lived as he soon began to suffer from pulmonary disease. Following the first attacks of his disease he went to southern France where he wrote philosophical works and poetry. He remained there until his early death at 33 years of age.

His mother Augustine Tuillerie published Le Tour de France par deux enfants in 1877 under the pseudonym G. Bruno.

Guyaus wife published short novels for young people under the pseudonym of Pierre Ulric.

Guyaus works primarily analyze and respond to modern philosophy especially moral philosophy. Largely seen as an Epicurean he viewed English utilitarianism as a modern version of Epicureanism. Although an enthusiastic admirer of the works of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill he did not spare them a careful scrutiny of their approach to morality. 

In his Esquisse dune morale sans obligation ni sanction probably his most important work on moral theory he begins from Fouillée maintaining that utilitarian and positivist schools despite admitting the presence of an unknowable in moral theory wrongly expel individual hypotheses directed towards this unknowable. He states that any valid theory of ethics must consider the moral sphere as consisting not merely of moral facts but also and more importantly of moral ideas. On the other hand in contrast to Fouillée he does not see this unknowable itself as able to contribute a principle practically limiting and restricting conduct i.e. of mere justice which he states comes too close to Kantian notions of duty; for this in turn would bring us back to a theory of moral obligation which as the title suggests he wishes to free moral theory from. Much of his treatise is dedicated to arguing what moral theory can be based upon that relieves moral theorists from relying on e.g. duty sanctions and obligations. For example

Guyau also took interest in aesthetic theory particularly its role in society and social evolution. Primarily Guyaus theories of aesthetics refute Immanuel Kants idea that aesthetic judgment is disinterested and accordingly partitioned off from the faculties of mind responsible for moral judgement. In Les Problèmes de lesthétique contemporaine Guyau argues that beauty in fact activates all dimensions of the mindthe sensual the intellectual and the moral. Aesthetic sensations are fully integrated with life and morality. They are also the mark of mans self-actualization. Contrary to Herbert Spencers theory that the development of the arts is an indicator of the decline of society at large Guyau maintains that as society continues to evolve life will become increasingly aesthetic. In LArt au point de vue sociologique Guyau argues the purpose of art is not to merely produce pleasure but to create sympathy among members of a society. By extension he contends that art has the power to reform societies as well as to form them anew.

Guyau authored La genèse de lidée de temps a book on the philosophy of time in 1890. Guyau argued that time itself does not exist in the universe but is produced by events that occur thus time to Guyau was a mental construction from events that take place. He asserted that time is a product of human imagination memory and will.

Although Guyau is now a relatively obscure philosopher his approach to philosophy earned him much praise from those who knew of him and his philosophy. Because he rarely made his political ideology explicit Guyau has been portrayed as a socialist an anarchist and as a libertarian liberal in the style of John Stuart Mill. However Guyau clearly expressed republican sympathies in which he praised the French Revolution saluted the Third Republics promotion of civic and moral education described voting as a duty and cautiously argued that democracy offered propitious conditions for creative development.

He is the original source of the notion of anomie which found much use in the philosophy of Guyaus contemporary Émile Durkheim who stumbled upon it in a review of Irréligion de lavenir. He is admired and well-quoted by the anarchist Peter Kropotkin in Kropotkins works on ethics where Guyau is described as an anarchist.Peter Kropotkin devotes an entire chapter to Guyau in his Ethics Origin and Development describing Guyaus moral teaching as so carefully conceived and expounded in so perfect a form that it is a simple matter to convey its essence in a few words while the American philosopher Josiah Royce considered him one of the most prominent of recent French philosophical critics."
Pierre Hadot,"Pierre Hadot was a French philosopher and historian of philosophy specializing in ancient philosophy particularly Neoplatonism.

In 1944 Hadot was ordained but following Pope Pius XIIs encyclical Humani generis left the priesthood. He studied at the Sorbonne between 19461947. In 1961 he graduated from the École Pratique des Hautes Études. In 1964 he was appointed a Director of Studies at EPHE initially occupying a chair in Latin Patristics before his chair was renamed Theologies and Mysticisms of Hellenistic Greece and the End of Antiquity in 1972. He became professor at the Collège de France in 1983 where he assumed the chair of the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought. In 1991 he retired from this position to become professeur honoraire at the collège; his last lecture was on 22 May that year. He concluded his final lecture by saying In the last analysis we can scarcely talk about what is most important.

Over the course of his career Hadot published translations of and commentaries on Porphyry St. Ambrose Plotinus and Marcus Aurelius.

Hadot was married to the historian of philosophy Ilsetraut Hadot.

Hadot was one of the first authors to introduce Ludwig Wittgensteins thought into France. Hadot suggested that one cannot separate the form of Wittgensteins Philosophical Investigations from their content. Wittgenstein had claimed that philosophy was an illness of language and Hadot notes that the cure required a particular type of literary genre.

Hadot is also famous for his analysis of the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. He identified and analyzed the spiritual exercises used in ancient philosophy . By spiritual exercises Hadot means practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them. The philosophy teachers discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple as auditor reader or interlocutor could make spiritual progress and transform himself within. Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings.

Hadots recurring theme is that philosophy in Antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception and therefore the being of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy as it is taught in universities today is for the most part a distortion of its original therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in What Is Ancient Philosophy which has been critically reviewed."
Élie Halévy,"In an article of 1893 Halévy suggested that the great moral question of modern thought was how the abstract idea of duty could become a concrete aim of society. This question had first attracted him to the utilitarians and he found at the core of their answer a fundamental contradiction. Utilitarianism he said was based on two principles first that the science of the legislator must bring together the naturally divergent interests of individuals in society; and second that social order comes about spontaneously through the harmony of individual interests. To Halévy this exemplified two fundamental human attitudes toward the universe the contemplation of the astronomer and the intervention of the engineer.

In 1892 Émile Boutmy invited Halévy to lecture on English political ideas at the newly founded School of Political Science. After 1900 he alternated this course with another on the history of socialism. At the same time he helped found the Revue de métaphysique et de morale in which he retained an interest until his death.

Halévys teaching led him to undertake annual trips to England during which he became the intimate friend of many of the most important scholars and political figures of the age. He thoroughly explored the Jeremy Bentham manuscripts at Cambridge for his work on philosophical radicalism and over the years developed a deep and intensive knowledge of all the sources of 19th-century English history. In 1901 he began to work on the first volume of his masterpiece the History of the English People in the Nineteenth Century . In this first volume he described England in 1815 and sought to explain how England avoided violent social change. If economic facts explain the course taken by the human race he wrote the England of the nineteenth century was surely above all other countries destined to revolution both politically and religiously. Neither the British constitution nor the Established Church was strong enough to hold the country together. He found the answer in religious nonconformity Methodism was the antidote to Jacobinism.

He did not write his history in chronological sequence nor did he live to complete it. The second and third volumes of this history carried the story up to 1841. Then Halévy profoundly moved by World War I turned his attention to the period from 1895 to 1914. The two volumes on this period were written with considerable detachment considering the immediacy of the problems he discussed. Together with Célestin Bouglé he would republish a set of Saint-Simonian lectures of the 1830 bundled in the 1924 work Doctrine de Saint-Simon.

The age of tyrannies dates from the month of August 1914 that is to say from the time when the belligerent nations first adopted a form of social organisation which may be defined as follows

In what proved to be his last work Halévy began to bridge the gap between 1841 and 1895 with a volume entitled The Age of Peel and Cobden . A liberal individualist to the last Halévy died at Sucy-en-Brie on 21 August 1937. His publishers posthumously commissioned R. B. McCallum to contribute a supplementary essay to link this volume with the concluding ones the whole appearing under the title Victorian Years in 1961."
Octave Hamelin,Octave Hamelin was a French philosopher. He taught as a professor at the University of Bordeaux and the University of Sorbonne . Hamelin was a close friend of the sociologist Émile Durkheim with whom he shared an interest in the French philosopher Charles Renouvier. He is also known as a translator of classical Greek philosophers.
Claude Adrien Helvétius,"Claude Adrien Helvétius was a French philosopher freemason and littérateur.

Claude Adrien Helvétius was born in Paris France and was descended from a family of physicians originally surnamed Schweitzer . His great-grandfather Johann Friedrich Schweitzer known as Helvetius was an Dutch physician and alchemist of German extraction. His grandfather Adriaan Helvetius introduced the use of ipecacuanha; his father Jean Claude Adrien Helvétius was first physician to Marie Leszczyńska queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three at the queens request he was appointed as a farmer-general a tax-collecting post worth 100000 crowns a year. Thus provided for he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost with the help of his wealth and liberality his literary and artistic tastes - he attended for example the progressive Club de lEntresol. As he grew older he began to seek more lasting distinctions stimulated by the success of Pierre Louis Maupertuis as a mathematician of Voltaire as a poet and of Montesquieu as a philosopher. His wife Anne-Catherine de Ligniville Madame Helvétius maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the Enlightenment for over five decades.

In 1758 Helvétius published his philosophical magnum opus a work called De lesprit which claimed that all human faculties are attributes of mere physical sensation and that the only real motive is self-interest therefore there is no good and evil only competitive pleasures. Its atheistic utilitarian and egalitarian doctrines raised a public outcry and the Sorbonne publicly burned it in 1759 forcing Helvétius to issue several retractions.

In 1764 Helvétius visited England and the next year at the invitation of Frederick II went to Berlin where the king paid him much attention.

After 10 years when he thought his fortune sufficient he gave up the post of farmer-general and retired to a country estate in France where he employed his fortune in the relief of the poor the encouragement of agriculture and the development of industries. For this he won the admiration of many of the philosophers.

Helvétius family lived alternately on Château de Voré and their Parisian townhouse at the rue Sainte-Anne.

Helvétius philosophical studies ended in the production of his famous book De lesprit . It was first published in 1758 and was intended to be the rival of Montesquieus The Spirit of the Laws with Helvétius arguing strongly against Montesquieus theory that climate influenced the character of nations.

The work attracted immediate attention and aroused the most formidable opposition especially from the dauphin Louis son of King Louis XV. The Advocate General Joly de Fleury condemned it in the Parlement of Paris in January 1759. The Sorbonne condemned the book while the priests persuaded the court that it was full of the most dangerous doctrines. The book was declared to be heretical so atheistic that it was condemned by Church and State and was burned. Helvétius terrified at the storm he had raised wrote three separate and humiliating retractions. In spite of his protestations of orthodoxy the book was publicly burned by the Paris hangman.

It had far-reaching negative effects on the rest of the philosophes in particular Denis Diderot and the great work he was doing on the Encyclopédie. The religious authorities particularly the Jesuits and the new Pope began to fear the spread of atheism and wanted to clamp down on the modern thought hard and quickly. De lesprit became almost a scapegoat for this.

This great publicity resulted in the book being translated into almost all the languages of Europe. Voltaire said that it lacked originality. Rousseau declared that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles. Grimm thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from Diderot. Madame du Deffand felt that Helvétius had raised such a storm by saying openly what everyone thought in secret. Madame de Graffigny claimed that all the good things in the book had been picked up in her own salon.

Helvétius philosophy belongs to the Egoist school

This view of man was largely Hobbesian man is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment and the ends of government are to ensure the maximization of pleasure.

This natural equality applied to all men in all nations and thus the differences in national characteristics were not the result of innate differences between the people therein but rather a byproduct of the system of education and government. No nation wrote Helvétius has reason to regard itself superior to others by virtue of its innate endowment.

This radically egalitarian aspect of Helvétius philosophy caused Diderot to remark that if it were true De lesprit might just as well have been written by Helvétius dogkeeper.

Since all men have the same natural potential Helvétius argued they all have the same ability to learn. Thus education is the method by which to reform society and there are few limits to the drastic social improvements that could be brought about by the appropriate distribution of education. Although people seem to possess certain qualities in greater abundance than their neighbours the explanation for this comes from above it is caused by education law and government. If we commonly meet in London with knowing men who are with much more difficulty found in France this is because it is a country where every citizen has a share in the management of affairs in general. The art of forming men he concludes is in all countries strictly connected to the form of the government and thus education via governmental intervention is the method of reform.

The crux of his thought was that public ethics has a utilitarian basis and he insisted strongly on the importance of culture and education in national development. His thinking can be described as unsystematic.

The original ideas in his system are those of the natural equality of intelligences and the omnipotence of education neither of which gained general acceptance though both were prominent in the system of John Stuart Mill. Cesare Beccaria states that he was largely inspired by Helvétius in his attempt to modify penal laws. Helvétius also exerted some influence on the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham.

The materialistic aspects of Helvétius along with Baron dHolbach had an influence on Karl Marx the theorist of historical materialism and communism who studied the ideas of Helvétius in Paris and later called the materialism of Helvétius and dHolbach the social basis of communism.

German philosopher Johann Georg Hamann vigorously opposed Helvétiuss rationalistic doctrines.

British philosopher Isaiah Berlin listed Helvétius along with Hegel Fichte Rousseau Saint-Simon and Maistre as one of the six enemies of freedom who constituted the ideological basis for modern authoritarianism in his book Freedom and Betrayal Six Enemies of Human Liberty.

His poetic ambitions resulted in the poem called Le Bonheur in which he develops the idea that true happiness is only to be found in making the interest of one person that of all.

A work called De lhomme de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation found among his manuscripts was published after his death. There is a complete edition of the works of Helvétius published at Paris 1818.

Michel Henry,"Michel Henry was a French philosopher phenomenologist and novelist. He wrote five novels and numerous philosophical works. He also lectured at universities in France Belgium the United States and Japan.

Michel Henry was born in Haiphong French Indochina and he lived in French Indochina until he was seven years old. Following the death of his father who was an officer in the French Navy he and his mother settled in metropolitan France. While studying in Paris he discovered a true passion for philosophy which he decided to make his professionhe enrolled at the École Normale Supérieure at the time part of the University of Paris. From June 1943 he was fully engaged with the French Resistance joining the maquis of the Haut Jura under the code name of Kant. He often had to come down from the mountains in order to accomplish missions in Nazi-occupied Lyon an experience of clandestinity that deeply marked his philosophy.

At the end of the war he took the final part of the philosophy examination at the university following which he wrote in 1963 a doctoral thesis from the University of Paris titled Lessence de la manifestation under the direction of Jean Hyppolite Jean Wahl Paul Ricœur Ferdinand Alquié and Henri Gouhier. His first book on the Philosophy and Phenomenology of the Body was completed in 1950. His first significant published work was on The Essence of Manifestation to which he devoted long years of necessary research in order to surmount the main deficiency of all intellectualist philosophy the ignorance of life as experienced.

From 1960 Michel Henry was a professor of philosophy at the University of Montpellier where he patiently perfected his work keeping himself away from philosophical fashions and far from dominant ideologies. He died in Albi France at the age of eighty.

The sole subject of his philosophy is living subjectivity which is to say the real life of living individuals. This subject is found in all his work and ensures its deep unity in spite of the diversity of themes he tackled. It has been suggested that he proposed the most profound theory of subjectivity in the Twentieth Century.

The work of Michel Henry is based on Phenomenology which is the study of the phenomenon. The EnglishGermanLatinate word phenomenon comes from the Greek phainomenon which means that which shows itself by coming into the light. The everyday understanding of phenomenon as appearance is only possible as a negative derivation of this authentic sense of Greek self-showing. The object of phenomenology is not however something that appears such as a particular thing or phenomena but the act of appearing itself. Henrys thought led him to a reversal of Husserlian phenomenology which acknowledges as phenomenon only that which appears in the world or exteriority. Henry counterposed this conception of phenomenality with a radical phenomenology of life.

Henry defines life from a phenomenological point of view as what possesses the faculty and the power to feel and to experience oneself in each point of its being. For Henry life is essentially force and affect; it is essentially invisible; it consists in a pure experience of itself which perpetually oscillates between suffering and joy; it is an always begun again passage from suffering to joy.Thought is for him only a mode of life because it is not thought which gives access to life but life that allows thought to reach itself.

According to Henry life can never be seen from the exterior as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and experiences itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way it is impossible to see another persons soul with the eyes or to perceive it at the end of a scalpel.

Henrys philosophy goes on to aver that we undergo life in a radical passivity we are reduced to bear it permanently as what we have not wanted and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation and the cause of suffering. No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time the simple fact of living of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of not existing is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its pathetic self-revelation .

For Henry life is not a universal blind impersonal and abstract substance it is necessarily the personal and concrete life of a living individual it carries in it a consubstantial Ipseity which refers to the fact of being itself to the fact of being a Self. This life is the personal and finite life of men or the personal and infinite life of God.

While the question of being regained importance in France in the posterity of Heidegger and that the question of the subject was revived Michel Henry has combined the most living contributions of philosophy to produce what remains today the last complete philosophical system. Life or absolute phenomenological life is the base or the foundation of this philosophical system it is its radical presupposition and its undeductible principle and so the essence or the foundation of all truth according to Michel Henry. Life escapes by principle and according to him to any distanciation to any transcendence merging in the unity of a feeling the speculative power of a principle and the material presence of an experience.

Being bullied or denied returning its forces against itself or on the opposite deploying itself freely as in the art in the love or in the work life through its multiples manifestations focalizes all the concern of Michel Henry thought. So phenomenology reaches according to Michel Henry its limits as the texture of phenomenality itself and its simple manifestation refers constantly to the inner reality and to the effectivity of life which it requires as condition of possibility. This is the meaning of the title of the main work of Michel Henry The essence of manifestation the world appears behind a subject who discovers this space of exteriority only because he is firstly in passivity relation with himself as being living.

But it is important to underline that for Michel Henry the human is an incarnated being he is not reduced to a pure spirit who surveys the world or to a disincarnate subject like the Kantian spectator of the Paralogisms. And that for him the subjectivity is identical with the body which doesnt reduces at all to an external and objective body as it appears into the world but which is on the opposite and in reality a subjective and living body which reveals itself permanently from the interior through the movement and sensing and by which we can act on the external world.

Two modes of manifestation of phenomena exist according to Henry which are two ways of appearing exteriority which is the mode of manifestation of the visible world and phenomenological interiority which is the mode of manifestation of invisible life. Our bodies for instance are in life given to us from the inside which allows us for example to move our hands and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object that we can see in the world.

The invisible here does not correspond to that which is too small to be seen with the naked eye or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive but rather to life which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world. No-one has ever seen a force a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.

Some of his assertions seem paradoxical and difficult to understand at first glance not only because they are taken out of context but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy which are forms of lies.

Michel Henry explains in his book I am the Truth. Towards a Philosophy of Christianity what Christianity considers to be the Truth and which he calls the Truth of Life. He shows that the Christian concept of Truth is opposed to what men habitually consider to be the truth which originates in Greek thought and which he calls the truth of the world. But what is truth Truth is what shows itself and thus demonstrates its reality in its effective manifestation in us or in the world.

The truth of the world designates an external and objective truth a truth in which everything appears to our gaze in the form of a visible object at a distance from us i.e. in the form of a representation which is distinct from what it shows when we look at an apple it is not the apple in itself that we see but a mere image of the apple that appears in our sensibility and which changes depending on the lighting or the angle from which we view it. In the same way when we look at a persons face it is not the person in herself that we see but only an image of her face her visible appearance in the world. According to this way of conceiving truth life is nothing more than a set of objective properties characterised by the need to feed oneself or ones aptitude for reproduction.

In Christianity Life is reduced to its internal reality which is absolutely subjective and radically immanent. Considered in its phenomenological reality Life is quite simply the faculty and the subjective ability to feel sensations small pleasures or great hurts to experience desires and feelings to move our bodies from within by exerting subjective effort or even to think. All such faculties possess the fundamental characteristic of appearing and manifesting themselves in themselves with no gap or distance; we do not perceive them from outside our being or as present to our gaze but only in us we coincide with each of these abilities. Life is in itself the power of manifestation and revelation and what it manifests is itself in its feeling self-revelation it is a power of revelation which is perpetually at work within us and which we continually forget.

The Truth of Life is absolutely subjective that is it is independent of our subjective beliefs and tastes. The perception of a coloured sensation or a pain for example is not a matter of personal preference but a fact and an incontestable inner experience which pertains to the absolute subjectivity of Life. The Truth of Life does not therefore differ in any way from that which it makes true it is not distinct from that which manifests itself in it. Truth is manifestation itself in its pure inner revelation and Life is what Christianity calls God.

The Truth of Life is not a relative truth which varies from one individual to another but absolute Truth which is the inner foundation of each of our faculties and abilities and which illuminates the least of our impressions. The Truth of Life is not an abstract and indifferent truth; on the contrary it is that which is most essential for man as it is this alone that can lead him to salvation in his inner identification with it and in becoming the Son of God rather than losing himself in the world.

For Michel Henry God is nothing but the absolute phenomenological life which gives each ego to himself and which reveals to us into both suffering and self-enjoyment. He says God is Life he is the essence of Life or if one prefers the essence of Life is God. Saying this we already know what God is we know it not through the effect of some knowledge or learning we do not know it through thought against the background of the truth of the world. Rather we know it and can know it only in and through Life itself. We can know the essence of God only in God.

In the work of Michel Henry the essence designates only the foundation the source the origin and the condition of possibility. This Life is not biological life defined by objective and exterior properties nor an abstract and empty philosophical concept but the absolute phenomenological life a radically immanent life which possesses in it the power of showing itself in itself without distance a life which reveals permanently itself. A manifestation of oneself and a self-revelation which doesnt consist in the fact of seeing outside oneself or of perceiving the exterior world but in the fact of feeling and of feeling oneself of experiencing in oneself its own inner and affective reality.

As Michel Henry says also in this same book God is that pure Revelation that reveals nothing other than itself. God reveals Himself. The Revelation of God is his self-revelation. God is in himself revelation he is the primordial Revelation that tears everything from nothingness a revelation which is the pathetic self-revelation and the absolute self-enjoyment of Life. As John says God is love because Life loves itself in an infinite and eternal love.

Michel Henry opposes to the notion of creation which is the creation of the world the notion of generation of Life. The creation of the world consists in the opening of this exteriority horizon where every thing becomes visible. Whereas Life never stops to generate itself and to generate all the livings in its radical immanence in its absolute phenomenological interiority that is without gap nor distance.

As we are living and by consequence generated continually by the infinite Life of God as he never stops to give us life and as we never cease of being born into the eternal present of life by the action in us of this absolute Life God is for Christianity our Father and we are its beloved Sons the Sons of the living God. This doesnt only mean that he has created us at the time of our conception or at the beginning of the world but that he never stops to generate us permanently into Life that he is always at work in us in the least of our subjective impressions.

For the French philosopher Michel Henry God is the invisible Life that never stops to generate us and to give us to ourselves in its pathetic self-revelation. According to his philosophy of Christianity and according to the founder texts of Christianity God is Love because Life loves itself in an infinite and eternal love. By consequence life is good in itself. But the fact that life is good doesnt comes from a judgment of intentional thought or of any science passed from the exterior on life it resides on the opposite according to Michel Henry in the immediate and immanent experience of life itself or more precisely in the very fact of undergoing experiencing itself in the delight of this experience that is its enjoyment of itself.

The evil corresponds to all what denies or attacks life it finds its origin in what Michel Henry calls death which is the negation or self-negation of life. This death is an inner affective and spiritual death which is the radical separation from God and his infinite love and which consists simply in not loving or despising life in living selfishly as if God didnt exist as if he was not our Father of us all and by consequence as if we were not all his beloved Sons and Daughters as if we were not all Brothers and Sisters generated by a same Life.

The evil peaks in the unlimited violence of hatred that is at the origin of all forms of barbarism of all the crimes of all the wars and of all the genocides that ravage the world. But the evil understood as self-negation of life is also the common origin of all those blind processes and of all those false abstractions that lead so many people to misery and exclusion. According to Alain David teacher in philosophy at Dijon Michel Henry has given us the means of really thinking this unlimited attack on life that is called Crime against humanity in the after-war political law which is for him one of the most important things for today philosophy.

For Michel Henry art or the contemplation of the beauty of art is not a separated domain reserved to snobs and to initiated people. For him every human being is potentially and perhaps even necessarily a painter and an artist because the possibility of painting is fundamentally written in him in reason of his inner life of his feeling of oneself and of sensibility he carries in him as he explains it in his book Seeing the invisible. According to Michel Henry the fundamental goal of art in general and in particular of music as it is understood by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer or of abstract painting as conceived by its founder Wassily Kandinsky is simply to use musical and pictorial means that are sounds or musical notes as well as forms and colors to express this continual emergence of life or its eternally living essence which is called an emotion. Thats this emotion or this ensemble of emotions that the artist wants to transmit to the auditor or that he searches to awake in the spectator through his musical or pictorial work this profusion of life in him its intensification and exaltation.

For Michel Henry who repeats in fact in this book Seeing the invisible what he considers as being one of Schopenhauers most important theses music expresses immediately our life that is our feelings. But music expresses ours feelings without relation to an external world or to any representation music realizes it simply in ordering sounds in order to reproduce the history of our unhappy existence who aspires fundamentally to find relief or absence of trouble throughout the long sequence of disillusions and chagrins. According to Michel Henry thats melody who accomplishes immediately this revelation of our suffering existence through the expressive power of music and its miraculous ability to disclose the immense domain of our feelings with their many nuances. But for Michel Henry a feeling can never be assimilated to an event in the world to a fact individuated in space and time which is destined to slide into the past and disappear excepted if it is confused with its occasional cause in the world a feeling is on the opposite according to him an original experience of life itself thats to say of an absolute subjectivity whose affectivity resides precisely in its immediate self-revelation.

In the same way for the painter and art theoretician Wassily Kandinsky the function of abstract painting is no longer to give us to see or to represent the external world or the objects it contains as it was the case with figurative painting of eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which is often without real interest on an esthetical or emotional point of view but on the contrary as with music to express or more precisely to show into the visible light our inner life our sensations our passions and our emotions. In order to reach expressing the invisible feelings or the hidden emotions of our soul abstract painting disposes simply according to Michel Henry of the basic elements of all painting which are linear forms and colors which the painter will dispose or draw on the surface of the paper or of the canvas. But each line drawn by the artist is fundamentally according to Michel Henry the product of a subjective force that he deploys at the surface of the support and exerts with his hand on his pencil or on his paint brush. As well as each color he uses is chosen for Michel Henry by the painter according to its expressive or emotional power which results simply from its own affective tonality from its inner resonance or from its inner sonority as also says Kandinsky thats to say finally from the purely subjective impression that color awakes immediately in us when we let it act on our sensibility. And as Michel Henry writes about Kandinskys abstract painting but also about every possible painting in general So if we are essentially force and affect then lines and colors allow the luminous emergence of our deepest being. 

For Michel Henry as well as for Wassily Kandinsky the true mission of art in general and of painting and music in particular is simply to exert an inner or spiritual action on the soul thats to say in reality an action on the interiority of life on affectivity and on the feeling who habits us a spiritual action which is fundamentally to allow abandoned men and women of our time to arrive at happiness through the refinement of our auditory and visual sensibility and of wonder this increased or more refined sensibility can produce in us. It is fundamentally a matter of saving men and women from boredom or abandonment in which they are enclosed in our modern world to allow them to escape the unbreakable boredom of the techno-media world with its drugs monstrous growth and anonymous transcendence and so to find themselves again or to reconnect to their deepest being what Kandinsky already considered as a mean of salvation in 1912 with the publication of his first great theoretical work untitled On the Spiritual in Art and in Painting in particular.

Because life is not only for Michel Henry a pure experience of oneself it is also according to him and as its direct result the growth of the self. A growth of the self which simply consists to the fact of experiencing oneself more intensely and so of enjoying oneself. Because life is not for Michel Henry something of static or fixed it is on the opposite according to him an eternal movement it is the eternal movement of the passage from Suffering to Joy. According to Michel Henry lifes experience of itself or the feeling of oneself that brings life to itself is a primal Suffering that art and authentic culture understood as self-transformation or as self-development of life can lead to enjoyment and the exaltation of oneself. This is precisely this eternal passage always restarted from suffering from lack and from Desire to the inner joy and to happiness that Michel Henry calls the resurrection of eternal life in the conclusion of his book Seeing the invisible. On Kandinsky.

Western philosophy as a whole since its Greek origins recognizes only the visible world and exteriority as the sole form of manifestation. It is trapped into what in The Essence of Manifestation Michel Henry calls ontological monism; it completely ignores the invisible interiority of life its radical immanence and its original mode of revelation which is irreducible to any form of transcendence or to any exteriority. When subjectivity or life are in question they are never grasped in their purity; they are systematically reduced to biological life to their external relation with the world or as in Husserl to an intentionality i.e. an orientation of consciousness towards an object outside it.

Henry rejects materialism which admits only matter as reality because the manifestation of matter in the transcendence of the world always presupposes lifes self-revelation whether in order to accede to it or to be able to see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image to a simple representation. For Michel Henry the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.

The deep originality of Michel Henrys thought and its radical novelty in relation to all preceding philosophy explains its fairly limited reception. It is however a philosophy that is admired for its rigor and its depth. But his thought is both difficult and demanding despite the simplicity and immediacy of its central and unique theme of phenomenological life the experience of which it tries to communicate. It is the immediacy and absolute transparency of life which explains the difficulty of grasping it as a thought it is much easier to speak of what we see than of this invisible life which fundamentally avoids being seen from the outside.

His thesis on The Essence of Manifestation was warmly welcomed by the members of the jury who recognized the intellectual value and the seriousness of its author although this thesis did not have any influence on their later works. His book on Marx was rejected by Marxists who were harshly criticized as well as by those who refused to see in Marx a philosopher and who reduced him to an ideologue responsible from Marxism. His book on Barbarism was considered by some as a rather simplistic and overly trenchant anti-scientific discourse. Nevertheless it seems that science and technology too often pursue their blind and unrestrained development in defiance of life.

His works on Christianity seem rather to have disappointed certain professional theologians and Catholic exegetes who contented themselves with picking out and correcting what they considered as dogmatic errors. His phenomenology of life was the subject of a pamphlet on Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française by Dominique Janicaud who sees in the immanence of life only the affirmation of a tautological interiority. On the other hand Antoine Vidalin published in 2006 a book entitled La parole de la Vie in which preface the Professor at the Institut dEtudes Théologiques from Brussels Jean-Marie Hennaux says that Michel Henrys phenomenology of life allows for a renewed approach to every area of theology and that his philosophy will allow the renewal and deepening of many theological questions.

As Alain David says in an article published in the French journal Revue philosophique de la France et de létranger the thought of Michel Henry seems so radical it affects our habitual ways of thinking so deeply that it has had a difficult reception even if all his readers declare themselves impressed by its power by the staggering effect of a thought which sweeps everything clean on its way through which prompts admiration but nevertheless doesnt really convince as we dont know whether we are confronted by the violence of a prophetic voice or by pure madness. In the same journal Rolf Kühn also asserts in order to explain the difficult reception of Michel Henrys work that if we do not side with any power in this world we inevitably submit to silence and to criticism from every possible power because we remind each institution that its visible or apparent power is in fact only powerlessness because nobody gives himself over to absolute phenomenological life.

His books have been translated into many languages notably English German Spanish Italian Portuguese and Japanese. A substantial amount of work has been dedicated to him mainly in French but also in German Spanish and Italian. A number of international seminars have also been dedicated to the thought of Michel Henry in Beirut Cerisy Namur Prague Montpellier Paris and Louvain-la-Neuve in 2010. Michel Henry is considered by the specialists who know his work and recognize its value as one of the most important contemporary philosophers and his phenomenology of life has started to gain a following. A Michel Henry Study Center has been established at St Josephs University in Beirut under the direction of Professor Jad Hatem.

Since 2006 the archives of the philosopher have been deposited by his wife at the Catholic University of Louvain where they form the Michel Henry archives Fund placed under the direction of Jean Leclercq. An annual review called Revue internationale Michel Henry is also edited by this Fund in collaboration with the Presses universitaires de Louvain since 2010.

A newsletter on Michel Henry in French called La gazette dAliahova is published every month by Roland Vaschalde since 2010. The goal of this publication is to keep informed of the articles books courses seminars and meetings on the thought of Michel Henry.

This book on The essence of manifestation is a work particularly long and dense often very technical and of a difficult access as it contains more than 900 pages in its French version. So it is in principle rather destined to students in philosophy to specialists and to professional philosophers. The lengthy introduction of this difficult book is devoted to the fundamental philosophical problem of the Being of the ego.

In his fundamental book on The essence of manifestation the purpose of Michel Henry is to put into light and to understand from a philosophical and phenomenological point of view which is the meaning of the Being of the ego thats to say what we understand precisely when we say about ourselves me I. However the true object of a first and fundamental research is not for Michel Henry the ego himself but the Being into and by which the ego can appear to existence and acquire his own Being. Michel Henry says that first philosophy is identical with a universal ontology because ontology is the science that studies Being in general and it is necessarily universal as its object isnt such thing in particular or such kind of things but what conditions them all equally.

In his Metaphysical meditations Descartes has begun a first philosophical research thats to say free from any prejudice and any historical tradition. The ego cogito is an undeniable evidence or a first truth so it is for Michel Henry the starting point and the true beginning of knowledge. The consciousness which manifests itself in the cogito is not only according to Michel Henry a region of Being but Being itself the absolute Being or more precisely the foundation of Being in general. This absolute ego is nothing for Michel Henry but the transcendental life itself considered as the origin of all what is given to consciousness in the transcendence.

The problem of the Being of the ego is in fact identical for Michel Henry to that to know how the ego can become a phenomenon thats to say can appear in front of us in the light of the world under the appearance of a transcendental field understood as the origin of Being of its different meanings and of its diverse structures. The phenomenological reduction or epoke which supposes to put into parenthesis all what we see and all the things we feel with our senses thats to say the work of transcendence to retain only the pure fact of appearing is precisely for Michel Henry the radical method that allows to grasp the pure self and the life which belongs to him as a transcendental life to which the world is immanent as an intentional component. The transcendence is the power which deploys the horizon of visibility where any Being can manifest itself and so become a phenomenon.

However the ego doesnt become a phenomenon according to Michel Henry by becoming visible in the transcendence of the world but on the opposite by remaining permanently in a sphere of radical immanence. The immanence is for him a pure revelation or an original revelation which owes nothing to the work of transcendence. The foundation or the essence of manifestation is for Michel Henry an original immanent revelation which reduces itself to a pure presence to itself even if such a presence remains invisible because it never appears in the exteriority of the visible world. The goal of this work of Michel Henry on the essence of manifestation is to show the existence of an absolute knowledge which doesnt depend of any philosophical or other progress and which is the medium of existence itself the essence of life.

This book of Michel Henry on material phenomenology is constituted of three studies on the question of phenomenology and each of these studies poses this question in its own way. The first study tries to show how material phenomenology distinguishes from classical or historical phenomenology about the problem of time which allows to Husserl to think how consciousness manifests itself thats to say phenomenality itself. A problem to which he searches the solution into intentionality which delivers according to Michel Henry the self-revelation of absolute subjectivity to the anonymous depriving it of every assignable phenomenological status.

The second study is devoted to the phenomenological method it searches to show that classical or historical phenomenology is confronted to the impossibility of providing a theoretical knowledge of absolute subjectivity so it offers according to Michel Henry the proof that transcendental life withdraws from every intentional approach from evidence and the pure seeing of phenomenological reduction. The extraordinary and unconscious path followed by the Husserl thought to try to overcome the aporia to which he was confronted is for Michel Henry the striking proof of the non-ekstatic status of life thats to say of the fact that it never manifests itself in the exteriority of a seeing.

The third study is composed of two texts from Michel Henry devoted to the fundamental philosophical problem of the experience of the other and on community. According to him the experience of the other and by consequence the relation to others doesnt funds on intentionality or on the opening to the alterity of a world but on the opposite on life which provides paradoxically the milieu or the medium in which all possible intersubjectivity can take place. For this is in the experience of a radically immanent subject that life arrives to itself individuals can communicate between them only because they are living and possess a common origin a common birth a shared essence.

The different philosophical systems all agreed despite the diversity of their theories concerning the body on the decisive doctrine of the belonging of the body to the being of the world. The first and the unique philosopher who understood the necessity of determining originally or fundamentally our body as a subjective body is Maine de Biran who Michel Henry calls a prince of thought and who deserves according to him to be considered as well as Descartes and Husserl as one of the true founders of a phenomenological science of human reality.

According to Maine de Biran the being or the reality of the ego does not reside in the immobility of substance-thought as in the cogito of Descartes but in the inner experience of a personal and purely subjective effort in its accomplishment. This is with this personal and purely subjective effort that begins and ends according to Maine de Biran the very being of the ego or its inner reality. The being or the true reality of the ego is no longer reduced to a pure thought whose nature is limited to the external knowledge of extension and to the contemplation of the external world. According to Maine de Biran the ego is first a power that manifests itself in the subjective effort he accomplishes at each time so that the cogito does not have for him the signification of being an I think but on the opposite of being an I can.

The depth of the philosophy of Maine de Biran resides according to Michel Henry in the affirmation that the true being of the movement but also of the action and of the power of the ego is accurately that of a cogito or of a subjectivity. According to Michel Henry the philosophical and ontological consequences of this thesis are infinite. By affirming like this the belonging of the true being of movement to what Michel Henry calls the sphere of the absolute immanence of subjectivity Maine de Biran proposes in reality an entirely new theory of the way whose knowledge of movement is given to us. This knowledge of movement is that of the personal and immanent experience that everyone does of its own subjective body and of its own life. Consequently movement is known to us in both an inner and immediate way which consequently concerns an absolute certainty.

Michel Henry is finally led at the end of his reflexion to distinguish three different bodies 1 The original being of the subjective body which is the absolute body of subjectivity as revealed in the internal experience of the movement and which possesses the immediate power to move its organs and knows this power with an inner and immanent knowledge; this subjective body is a fundamental I can and its being is a pure revelation of itself. 2 The organic body which is the immediate and moving terminus of the subjective body or rather the ensemble of the termini over which movement has a hold; it is the transcendent medium that gives up to the effort of our movement; it is divided into various transcendent masses whose unity is provided by the subjective body. 3 The transcendent or objective body which manifests in the external world where it appears with the signification of being mine; the objective body can be the theme of scientific research; this is the only body known by the philosophical tradition.

According to Michel Henry the world consists in the totality of the contents of all experiences that can live or feel our subjective body it is in reality the terminus or the limit of all our real possible and imaginable movements that we can accomplish. The power of acting that Michel Henry also calls the habit is finally the real and concrete possibility of a world being given to us it is a possibility of knowledge in general. The world is the terminus or the outcome of all our subjective power and of all our habits and it is for this reason that we are truly its inhabitants. The body is however not an instantaneous knowledge it is on the contrary a permanent knowledge which coincides with our own existence so that we can say that the subjective body as a whole is memory. As underlined by Michel Henry habit is the foundation for memory which significates that the original being of the subjective body is a possibility of knowledge in general thats to say a knowledge or a memory of the world in its absence and consequently an immanent memory of its forms.

Michel Henry undertook a study of the historical and philosophical genesis of psychoanalysis in the light of phenomenology of life in Généalogie de la psychanalyse le commencement perdu in which he shows that the Freudian notion of the unconscious results from the inability of Freud its founder to think the essence of life in its purity as affectivity and auto-affection. The repressed representation does not come from the unconscious it is simply unformed the unconscious is only an empty representation it does not existor rather the real unconscious is life itself in its pathetic reality. And it is not repression that provokes anguish whose existence depends on the mere fact of power but unused psychic energy or libido. As for the notion of consciousness it simply means the power of seeing it is nothing but a consciousness of the object which leads to an empty subjectivity.

Henrys planned last book was entitled Le Livre des Morts and would have dealt with what he called clandestine subjectivity a theme which evokes the condition of life in the modern world and which also alludes to his commitment to the Resistance and his personal experience of clandestinity.

Michel Henry wrote an important work on Karl Marx whom he considers paradoxically as one of the leading Christian thinkers and one of the most important western philosophers due to the weight he gives in his thought to living work and to the living individual in which he sees the foundation of economic reality. One reason why Marxs genuine thought has been so misunderstood is the complete ignorance of his fundamental philosophical writings during the development of the official doctrine of Marxism due to their very late publication for example The German Ideology only appeared in 1932.

But the real reason for ignorance of Marxs philosophical texts is Marxisms negation from its earliest days of subjectivity because Marxism is nothing other than a repetition of Hegelianism which is a philosophy of objectivity which reduces the individual to the effective becoming of the Absolute and its manifestation in the light of ek-static exteriority. This work on Marx was published in two volumes entitled respectively Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité and Marx II. Une philosophie de léconomie translated in English as Marx A Philosophy of Human Reality.

Communism and Capitalism are for Michel Henry two faces of the one death which consists in the negation of life. Communism eliminates individual life in favour of universal abstractions like society people history or social classes. Marxism is according to Michel Henry a form of fascism i.e. a doctrine which originates in the degradation of the individual whose elimination is considered as legitimate whereas capitalism substitutes economic entities such as money profit or interest for the real needs of life.

Capitalism however recognizes life as a source of value wages being the objective representation of real subjective and living work. But capitalism progressively gives way to the exclusion of subjectivity by modern technology which replaces living work by automated technological processes eliminating at one stroke the power of creating value and ultimately value itself possessions are produced in abundance but unemployment increases and there is a continual shortage of money to buy them. These themes are developed in Du communisme au capitalisme théorie dune catastrophe .

The initial title of this book should have been The two faces death but this title has been refused by the editor for obvious reasons of international actuality as confided Michel Henry in an interview with Olivier Salazar-Ferrer published in 1991 in the Agones review.

In his essay Barbarism Michel Henry examines the link that exists between barbarism and science or modern technology from their opposition to culture understood as self-development of sensibility and of inner or purely subjective life of living individuals. Science is founded on the idea of a universal and as such objective truth and which therefore leads to the elimination of the sensible qualities of the world sensibility and life. There is nothing wrong with science in itself as long as it is restricted to the study of nature but it tends to exclude all traditional forms of culture such as art ethics and religion. Science left to its own devices leads to technology whose blind processes develop themselves independently in a monstrous fashion with no reference to life.

Science is a form of culture in which life denies itself and refuses itself any value. It is a practical negation of life which develops into a theoretical negation in the form of ideologies that reduces all possible knowledge to that of science such as the human sciences whose very objectivity deprives them of their object what value do statistics have faced with suicide what do they say about the anguish and the despair that produce it These ideologies have invaded the university and are precipitating it to its destruction by eliminating life from research and teaching. Television is the truth of technology; it is the practice par excellence of barbarism it reduces every event to current affairs to incoherent and insignificant facts.

This negation of life results according to Michel Henry from the disease of life from its secret dissatisfaction with the self which leads it to deny itself to flee itself in order to escape its anguish and its own suffering. In the modern world we are almost all condemned from childhood to flee our anguish and our proper life in the mediocrity of the media universe an escape from self and a dissatisfaction which lead to violence rather than resorting to the most highly developed traditional forms of culture which enable the overcoming of this suffering and its transformation into joy. Culture subsists despite everything but in a kind of incognito; in our materialist society which is sinking into barbarism it must necessarily operate in a clandestine way.

Michel Henry was a student of ancient painting and of the great classical painting which preceded the scientistic figuration of the 18th and 19th Centuries and also of abstract creations such as those of the painter Wassily Kandinsky. Henry dedicated a book entitled Voir linvisible to Kandinsky in which he describes his work in laudatory terms. He analyses Kandinskys theoretical writings on art and painting in their spiritual and cultural dimensions as a means of self-growth and refinement of ones sensibility. He explores paintings means of form and colour and studies their effects on the inner life of one who looks at them filled with wonder following the rigorous and almost phenomenological analysis proposed by Kandinsky. He explains that every form of painting capable of moving us is in reality abstract i.e. it is not content to reproduce the world but seeks to express the invisible power and invisible life that we are. He evokes also the great thought of Kandinsky the synthesis of arts their unity in the monumental art as well as the cosmic dimension of art.

In his book I am the Truth Towards a Philosophy of Christianity Michel Henry confronts his phenomenology of life with the foundational texts of Christianity. Life loves itself with an infinite love and never ceases to engender itself; it never ceases to engender each one of us as its beloved Son or Daughter in the eternal present of life. Life is nothing but this absolute love that religion calls God. That is why Life is sacred and it is for this reason that no-one has the right to assault another or attack anothers life.

The problem of evil is that of the inner and phenomenological death of the apparently or externally living individuals who do it; that is in reality of the inner affective and spiritual degeneration from their original condition of Son of God when life they carry in them turns against itself in the terrible phenomena of hate and resentment. Because as John says in his first epistle anyone who does not love remains in death whereas everyone who loves has been born of God. The commandment of love is not an ethical law but Life itself.

This work also proposes a phenomenology of Christ who is understood as the First Living Being. A living being is simply that which succeeds in the pure revelation of self or self-revelation that is Life. It is in the form of an effective and singular Ipseity that Life never ceases to engender itself. It never ceases to occur in the form of a singular Self that embraces itself experiences itself and finds joy in itself and that Michel Henry calls the First Living Being. Or again the Arch-Son as he himself inhabits the Origin and the Beginning and is engendered in the very process whereby the Father engenders himself.

Michel Henry tells us in this book that the purpose of the coming of Christ into the world is to make the true Father manifest to people and thus to save them from the forgetting of Life in which they stand. A forgetting which leads them falsely to believe themselves as being the source of their own powers their own pleasures and their own feelings and to live in the terrifying lack of that which however gives each ego to itself. The plenitude of life and the feeling of satisfaction it brings must yield to the great Rift to the Desire that no object can fulfill to the Hunger that nothing can satisfy.

In his book Incarnation. A philosophy of Flesh Henry starts by opposing the sensible and living flesh as we experience it perpetually from the inside to the inert and material body as we can see it from the outside like other objects we find in the world. The flesh does not correspond at all in his terminology to the soft part of our material and objective body as opposed for example to the bones but to what he called in his earlier books our subjective body. For Henry an object possesses no interiority it is not living it does not feel itself and does not feel that it is touched it does not subjectively experience being touched.

Having put the difficult problem of the incarnation in a historical perspective by going back to the thought of the Church Fathers he undertakes a critical re-reading of the phenomenological tradition that leads to a reversal of phenomenology. He then proposes to elaborate a phenomenology of the flesh which leads to the notion of an originary flesh which is not constituted but is given in the arch-revelation of Life as well as a phenomenology of Incarnation.

Although the flesh is traditionally understood as the seat of sin in Christianity it is also the place of salvation which consists in the deification of man i.e. in the fact of becoming the Son of God of returning to the eternal and absolute Life we had forgotten in losing ourselves in the world in caring only about things and ourselves. In sin we have the tragic experience of our powerlessness to do the good we would like to do and of our inability to avoid evil. Thus faced with the magical body of the other it is the anguished desire to rejoin the life in it that leads to error. In the night of lovers the sexual act couples two impulsive movements but erotic desire fails to attain the pleasure of the other just there where it is experienced in a complete loving fusion. The erotic relation is however doubled by a pure affective relation foreign to the carnal coupling a relation made of mutual gratitude or love. It is this affective dimension that is denied in the form of violence that is pornography which wrenches the erotic relation from the pathos of life in order to deliver it to the world and which constitutes a genuine profanation of life.

As Henry says in his last book Words of Christ it is in the heart that life speaks in its immediate pathetic self-revelation; but the heart is blind to the Truth it is deaf to the word of Life it is hard and selfish and it is from this that evil comes. It is in the violence of its silent and implacable self-revelation which bears witness against this degenerate life and against the evil that comes from it that Judgement stands Judgement which is identical to the advent of each Self to itself and from which none can escape."
Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński,"Józef Maria Hoëné-Wroński was a Polish Messianist philosopher mathematician physicist inventor lawyer occultist and economist. He was born Hoene to a municipal architect in 1776 but changed his name in 1815.

In 1803 Wroński joined the Marseille Observatory but was forced to leave the observatory after his theories were dismissed as grandiose rubbish. In mathematics Wroński introduced a novel series expansion for a function in response to Joseph Louis Lagranges use of infinite series. The coefficients in Wrońskis new series form the Wronskian a determinant Thomas Muir named in 1882.

His father Antoni was the municipal architect of Poznań and came from a Bohemian family settled in western Poland. Józef was educated in Poznań and Warsaw. In 1794 he served in Polands Kościuszko Uprising as a second lieutenant of artillery was taken prisoner and remained until 1797 in the Russian Army. After resigning in the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1798 he studied in the Holy Roman Empire until 1800 when he enlisted in the Polish Legion at Marseille. There he began his scientific and scholarly work and conceived the idea of a great philosophical system. Ten years later he moved to Paris where he would spend most of his life working unremittingly to the last in the most difficult material circumstances.

He wrote exclusively in French in the desire that his ideas of whose immortality he was convinced be accessible to all; he worked he said through France for Poland. He published over a hundred works and left many more in manuscript; at 75 years of age and nearing death he exclaimed God Almighty theres still so much more I wanted to say

In science Hoene-Wroński set himself an extraordinary task the complete reform of philosophy as well as that of mathematics astronomy and technology. He elaborated not only a system of philosophy but also applications to politics history economics law psychology music and pedagogy. It was his aspiration to reform human knowledge in an absolute that is ultimate manner.

In 1803 Wroński joined the Marseille Observatory and began developing an enormously complex theory of the structure and origin of the universe. During this period he took up a correspondence with nearly all of the major scientists and mathematicians of his day and was well respected at the observatory. In 1803 Wronski experienced a mystical illumination which he regarded as the discovery of the Absolute.

In 1810 he published the results of his scientific research in a massive tome which he advocated as a new foundation for all of science and mathematics. His theories were strongly Pythagorean holding numbers and their properties to be the fundamental underpinning of essentially everything in the universe. His claims were met with little acceptance and his research and theories were generally dismissed as grandiose rubbish. His earlier correspondence with major figures meant that his writings garnered more attention than a typical crackpot theory even earning a review from the great mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange . In the ensuing controversy he was forced to leave the observatory.

He immediately turned his focus towards applying philosophy to mathematics . In 1812 he published a paper purporting to show that every equation has an algebraic solution directly contradicting results which had been recently published by Paolo Ruffini; Ruffini turned out to be correct.

He later turned his attention to disparate and largely unsuccessful pursuits such as a fantastical design for caterpillar-like vehicles which he intended to replace railroad transportation but did not manage to persuade anyone to give the design serious attention. In 1819 he travelled to England in an attempt to obtain financial backing from the Board of Longitude to build a device to determine longitude at sea. After initial difficulties he was given an opportunity to address the Board but his pretentious address On the Longitude contained much philosophizing and generalities but no concrete plans for a working device and thus failed to gain any support from the Board. He remained for several years in England and in 1821 published an introductory text on mathematics in London which moderately improved his financial situation.

In 1822 he returned to France and again took up a combination of mathematics and far-fetched ideas despite being in poverty and scorned by intellectual society. Along with his continuing Pythagorean obsession he spent much time working on several notoriously futile endeavors including attempts to build a perpetual motion machine to square the circle and to build a machine to predict the future .In 1852 shortly before his death he did find a willing audience for his ideas the occultist Eliphas Levi who met Wroński and was greatly impressed and attracted by his religious and scientific utopianism. Wroński was a powerful catalyst for Levis occultism.

Wroński died in 1853 in Neuilly-sur-Seine France on the outskirts of Paris.

During his lifetime nearly all his work was dismissed as nonsense. However some of it came to be regarded in a more favourable light in later years. Although most of his inflated claims were groundless his mathematical work contains flashes of deep insight and many important intermediary results the most significant of which was his work on series. He had strongly criticized Lagrange for his use of infinite series introducing instead a novel series expansion for a function. His criticisms of Lagrange were for the most part unfounded but the coefficients in Wrońskis new series proved important after his death forming a determinant now known as the Wronskian .

The level of Wrońskis scientific and scholarly accomplishments and the amplitude of his objectives placed Wroński in the first rank of European metaphysicians in the early 19th century. But the abstract formalism and obscurity of his thought the difficulty of his language his boundless self-assurance and his uncompromising judgments of others alienated him from most of the scientific community. He was perhaps the most original of the Polish metaphysicians but others were more representative of the Polish outlook."
Baron d'Holbach,"Paul-Henri Thiry Baron dHolbach was a French-German philosopher encyclopedist writer and prominent figure in the French Enlightenment. He was born Paul Heinrich Dietrich in Edesheim near Landau in the Rhenish Palatinate but lived and worked mainly in Paris where he kept a salon. He was well known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion the most famous of them being The System of Nature and The Universal Morality .

Sources differ regarding dHolbachs dates of birth and death. His exact birthday is unknown although records show that he was baptised on 8 December 1723. Some authorities incorrectly give June 1789 as the month of his death.

DHolbachs mother Catherine Jacobina was the daughter of Johannes Jacobus Holbach the Prince-Bishops tax collector for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. His father Johann Jakob Dietrich was a wine-grower.

DHolbach wrote nothing of his childhood though it is known he was raised in Paris by his uncle Franz Adam Holbach who had become a millionaire by speculating on the Paris stock-exchange. With his financial support dHolbach attended the Leiden University from 1744 to 1748. Here he became friends with John Wilkes. Later he went on to marry his second cousin Basile-Geneviève dAine on 11 December 1750. In 1753 a son was born Francois Nicholas who left France before his father died. In 1753 both dHolbachs uncle and father died leaving him with an enormous inheritance such as Heeze Castle Kasteel Heeze te Heeze.

DHolbach would remain wealthy throughout his life. In 1754 his wife died from an unknown disease. The distraught dHolbach moved to the provinces for a brief period with his friend Baron Grimm and in the following year received a special dispensation from the Pope to marry his deceased wifes sister Charlotte-Suzanne dAine . They had a son Charles-Marius and two daughters Amélie-Suzanne and Louise-Pauline .

During the summer months when Paris was hot and humid Baron dHolbach retreated to his country estate at Grandval Le Château de Grand-Val . There he would invite friends to stay for a few days or weeks and every year he invited Denis Diderot.

DHolbach was known for his generosity often providing financial support discreetly or anonymously to his friends amongst them Diderot. It is thought that the virtuous atheist Wolmar in Jean-Jacques Rousseaus Julie ou la nouvelle Héloïse is based on dHolbach.

Holbach died in Paris on 21 January 1789 a few months before the French Revolution. The authorship of his various anti-religious works did not become widely known until the early 19th century. Ironically he was buried in the Church of Saint-Roch Paris. The exact location of the grave is unknown.

From c. 1750 to c. 1790 Baron dHolbach used his wealth to maintain one of the more notable and lavish Parisian salons which soon became an important meeting place for the contributors to the Encyclopédie.

Meetings were held regularly twice a week on Sundays and Thursdays in dHolbachs home in rue Royale. Visitors to the salon were exclusively males and the tone of discussion highbrow often extending to topics more extensive than those of other salons. This along with the excellent food expensive wine and a library of over 3000 volumes attracted many notable visitors. Among the regulars in attendance at the salonthe coterie holbachiquewere the following Diderot Grimm Condillac Condorcet DAlembert Marmontel Turgot La Condamine Raynal Helvétius Galiani Morellet Naigeon and for a time Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The salon was also visited by prominent British intellectuals amongst them Adam Smith David Hume John Wilkes Horace Walpole Edward Gibbon David Garrick Laurence Sterne; the Italian Cesare Beccaria; and the American Benjamin Franklin.

Morellet a regular attendee at DHolbachs salon described it as

In a frequently narrated story about a discussion that had taken place in DHolbachs salon David Hume had questioned whether atheists actually existed whereupon DHolbach had clarified that Hume was sitting at a table with seventeen atheists.

For the Encyclopédie dHolbach authored and translated a large number of articles on topics ranging from politics and religion to chemistry and mineralogy. As a German who had become a naturalised Frenchman he undertook the translation of many contemporary German works of natural philosophy into French. Between 1751 and 1765 DHolbach contributed some four hundred articles to the project mostly on scientific subjects in addition to serving as the editor of several volumes on natural philosophy. DHolbach may also have written several disparaging entries on non-Christian religions intended as veiled criticisms of Christianity itself.

Despite his extensive contributions to the Encyclopédie dHolbach is better known today for his philosophical writings all of which were published anonymously or under pseudonyms and printed outside France usually in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey. His philosophy was expressly materialistic and atheistic and is today categorised into the philosophical movement called French materialism. In 1761 Christianisme dévoilé appeared in which he attacked Christianity and religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity. The deistic Voltaire denying authorship of the work made known his aversion to dHolbachs philosophy writing that 

In 1770 dHolbach published his most famous book The System of Nature under the name of Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud the secretary of the Académie who had died ten years previously. Denying the existence of a deity and refusing to admit as evidence all a priori arguments dHolbach saw the universe as nothing more than matter in motion bound by inexorable natural laws of cause and effect. There is he wrote no necessity to have recourse to supernatural powers to account for the formation of things.

The System of Nature is a long and extensive work presenting a thoroughly naturalistic view of the world. Some dHolbach scholars have pointed out that Denis Diderot was a close personal friend of dHolbachs and that it is unclear to what extent dHolbach was influenced by him. Indeed Diderot may possibly have been the author of parts of the System of Nature. Regardless however of the extent of Diderots contribution to the System of Nature it is on the basis of this work that dHolbachs philosophy has been called the culmination of French materialism and atheism.

DHolbachs objectives in challenging religion were primarily moral he saw the institutions of Christianity as a major obstacle to the improvement of society. For him the foundation of morality was to be sought not in Scripture but in happiness It would be useless and almost unjust to insist upon a mans being virtuous if he cannot be so without being unhappy. So long as vice renders him happy he should love vice. DHolbachs radicalism posited that humans were fundamentally motivated by the pursuit of enlightened self-interest which is what he meant by society rather than by empty and selfish gratification of purely individual needs. Chapter 15 of Part I of System of Nature is titled Of Mans true Interest or of the Ideas he forms to himself of Happiness. Man cannot be happy without Virtue.

It is quite natural in man it is extremely reasonable it is absolutely necessary to desire those things which can contribute to augment the sum of his felicity. Pleasure riches power are objects worthy his ambition deserving his most strenuous efforts when he has learned how to employ them; when he has acquired the faculty of making them render his existence really more agreeable. It is impossible to censure him who desires them to despise him who commands them but when to obtain them he employs odious means; or when after he has obtained them he makes a pernicious use of them injurious to himself prejudicial to others; let him wish for power let him seek after grandeur let him be ambitious of reputation when he can show just pretensions to them; when he can obtain them without making the purchase at the expense of his own repose or that of the beings with whom he lives let him desire riches when he knows how to make a use of them that is truly advantageous for himself really beneficial for others; but never let him employ those means to procure them of which he may be ashamed; with which he may be obliged to reproach himself; which may draw upon him the hatred of his associates; or which may render him obnoxious to the castigation of society let him always recollect that his solid happiness should rest its foundations upon its own esteem upon the advantages he procures for others; above all never let him for a moment forget that of all the objects to which his ambition may point the most impracticable for a being who lives in society is that of attempting to render himself exclusively happy.

The explicitly atheistic and materialistic The System of Nature presented a core of radical ideas which many contemporaries both churchmen and philosophes found disturbing and thus prompted a strong reaction.

The Catholic Church in France threatened the crown with withdrawal of financial support unless it effectively suppressed the circulation of the book. The list of people writing refutations of the work was long. The prominent Catholic theologian Nicolas-Sylvestre Bergier wrote a refutation titled Examen du matérialisme . Voltaire hastily seized his pen to refute the philosophy of the Système in the article Dieu in his Dictionnaire philosophique while Frederick the Great also drew up an answer to it. Its principles are summed up in a more popular form in dHolbachs Good Sense or Natural Ideas Opposed to Supernatural.

In his last works DHolbachs attention largely shifted away from religious metaphysics towards moral and political questions. In the Système social the Politique naturelle and the Morale universelle he attempted to describe a system of morality in place of the Christian one he had so fiercely attacked but these later writings were not as popular or influential as his earlier work. DHolbach was critical towards abuses of power in France and abroad. Contrary to the revolutionary spirit of the time however he called for the educated classes to reform the corrupt system of government and warned against revolution democracy and mob rule.

His political and ethical views were influenced by British materialist Thomas Hobbes. DHolbach personally translated Hobbes work De Homine into French.

In his Système de la nature the three-volume Système social two-volume Politique naturelle and Ethiocratie dHolbach gave his economic views. Following Locke dHolbach defended private property and stated that wealth is generated from labor and all should have the right to the product of their labor. He endorsed the theory of laissez-faire arguing

The government should do nothing for the merchant except to leave him alone. No regulations can guide him in his enterprise so well as his own interest. The state owes commerce nothing but protection. Among commercial nations those that allow their subjects the most unlimited liberty may be sure of soon excelling all others.

However DHolbach also believed that the state should prevent a dangerous concentration of wealth amongst a few individuals from taking place. According to him hereditary aristocracy should be abolished on the ground that it breeds indolence and incompetence. He criticized the then prevailing policy of the French government to let private individuals collect tax on the ground that the tax collectors often extort double the money they are supposed to collect from the citizens. He also believed that religious groups should be voluntary organizations without any government support. In addition DHolbach is counted among the fiercest critics of luxury in the 18th-century debate.

DHolbach is believed to have died shortly before the French Revolution. He was buried on 21 January 1789 in the ossuarium beneath the altar in the parish church of Saint-Roch Paris. This ossuarium has been ransacked twice once during the French Revolution and again during the 1871 Paris Commune.

It is not clear when dHolbach and Diderot first met but by 1752 they definitely knew each other. This was the year when Volume II of the Encyclopédie containing contributions by dHolbach appeared. The two were in substantial agreement on questions related to religion and philosophy. They also shared similar interests like gourmandizing taking country walks and collecting fine prints and beautiful paintings.

When dHolbachs radically atheistic and materialistic The System of Nature was first published many believed Diderot to be the actual author of the book. Based on the writing style the Durants opine that the book was not written by Diderot although he may have composed the flowery address to Nature towards the end of the book.

The attendees at dHolbachs dinners included Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau stopped attending the salon for some time after an incident in February 1754. Diderot had arranged for an acquaintance of his the Abbé Petit to read a tragedy composed by the Abbé at dHolbachs. When the Abbé presented his work he preceded it by reading his treatise on theatrical composition which the attendees at dHolbachs found so absurd that they could not help being amused. The attendeesDiderot Marmontel Grimm Saint-Lambert and othersthen proceeded to direct lavish praise at the Abbé which made him happy. DHolbach later narrated what happened

I will confess that half-laughingly half-soberly I myself strung the poor curé along. Jean-Jacques hadnt said a word hadnt smiled an instant hadnt moved from his armchair. Suddenly he rose up like a madman and springing towards the curé took his manuscript threw it on the floor and cried to the appalled author Your play is worthless your dissertation an absurdity all these gentlemen are making fun of you. Leave here and go back to do curates duty in your village. Then the curé got up no less furious spewed forth all imaginable insults against his too sincere advisor and from insults would have passed to blows and to tragic murder if we had not separated them. Rousseau left in a rage which I believed to be temporary but which has never ceased and which has done nothing but increase since that time.

Later in 1754 when he learnt that Mme dHolbach had died Rousseau wrote a tender condolence letter to dHolbach and the friendship between the two men was rekindled. For three more years Rousseau would frequent the salon of dHolbach.

DHolbach later arranged along with Grimm and Diderot for an annuity of 400 livres for Rousseaus common-law wife Thérèse Levasseur and her mother pledging them not to reveal this to Rousseau for fear of wounding Rousseaus pride. When Rousseau eventually found out about this he was furious with his friends for humiliating him.

According to Marmontel dHolbach had read everything and never forgotten anything of interest.Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented that dHolbach could hold his own among scholars since he was learned and knowledgeable.Diderot enthusiastically endorsed dHolbachs book System of Nature.

DHolbachs philosophy influenced Marat Danton and Camille Desmoulins. According to Faguet dHolbach more than Voltaire more than Diderot is the father of all the philosophy and all the anti-religious polemics at the end of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century.

During the French Directory a book of dHolbach was circulated to all departmental heads in a bid to rein in religious revivalism. In England dHolbachs views influenced Priestley Godwin and Shelley. In Germany dHolbachs views influenced Immanuel Kant. It is speculated that dHolbachs views influenced the historical materialism of Karl Marx."
Pierre Daniel Huet,"Pierre Daniel Huet was a French churchman and scholar editor of the Delphin Classics founder of the Académie de Physique in Caen and Bishop of Soissons from 1685 to 1689 and afterwards of Avranches.

He was born in Caen in 1630 and educated at the Jesuit school there. He also received lessons from a Protestant pastor Samuel Bochart. By the age of twenty he was recognized as one of the most promising scholars of his time. In 1651 he went to Paris where he formed a friendship with Gabriel Naudé conservator of the Mazarin Library. In the following year Samuel Bochart being invited by Queen Christina of Sweden to her court at Stockholm took his friend Huet with him. This journey in which he saw Leiden Amsterdam and Copenhagen as well as Stockholm resulted chiefly in the discovery in the Swedish royal library of some fragments of Origens Commentary on St Matthew which gave Huet the idea of editing and translating Origen into Latin a task he completed in 1668. He eventually quarrelled with Bochart who accused him of having suppressed a line in Origen in the Eucharistic controversy. While working on Origens Greek text Huet wrote a separate treatise on translation history theory and practice the De optimo genere interpretandi in two books .

Huet was also the cofounder of the Académie de Physique in Caen the first provincial academy of science to be granted a royal charter . Huet was the initial patron of the academy and along with Andre Graindorge directed the work of the group which focused on the empirical study of nature with a special emphasis on anatomy and dissections. Huets presence was critical to the success of the academy which floundered without his continued presence. He acted as head of the group from 16621667 and again in 1668 when he left Caen again for Paris. He also ended his financial support of the academy at this time as it began to receive royal funding and direction from the royal representative in Normandy Guy Chamillart.

In Paris he entered into close relations with Jean Chapelain. During the famous dispute of Ancients and Moderns Huet took the side of the Ancients against Charles Perrault and Jean Desmarets. Among his friends at this period were Valentin Conrart and Paul Pellisson. His taste for mathematics led him to the study of astronomy. He next turned his attention to anatomy and being short-sighted devoted his inquiries mainly to the question of vision and the formation of the eye. In the course of this study he made more than 800 dissections. He then learned all that was then to be learned in chemistry and wrote a Latin poem on salt.

All this time he was a frequent visitor to the salons of Mlle de Scudéry and the studios of painters; his scientific researches did not interfere with his classical studies for during this time he was discussing with Bochart the origin of certain medals and was learning Syriac and Arabic under the Jesuit Adrien Parvilliers.

Huet was admitted to the Académie française in 1674. He took holy orders in 1676 and two years later the king made him abbot of Aunay. In 1685 he became Bishop of Soissons but after waiting for installation for four years he took the bishopric of Avranches instead. He exchanged the cares of his bishopric for what he thought would be the easier chair of the Abbey of Fontenay but there he was vexed with continual lawsuits. At length he retired to the Jesuits House in the Rue Saint-Antoine at Paris where he died in 1721. His great library and manuscripts after being bequeathed to the Jesuits were bought by the king for the royal library.

He translated the pastorals of Longus wrote a tale called Diane de Castro and gave with his Traitté de lorigine des romans his Treatise on the Origin of Romances the first world history of fiction. On being appointed assistant tutor to the Dauphin in 1670 he edited with the assistance of Anne Lefêvre and Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet the well-known book series the Delphin Classics . This series published comprehensive editions of the Latin classics in about sixty volumes and each work was accompanied by a Latin commentary ordo verborum and verbal index. The original volumes have each an engraving of Arion and a dolphin and the appropriate inscription in usum serenissimi Delphini.

In addition to Huets edition and translation of the ancient Greek theologian Origen Huet published two works on the history and process of translation itself De optimo genere interpretandi and De claris interpretibus .

He issued one of his major works the Demonstratio evangelica in 1679. At Aulnay he wrote his Questiones Aletuanae his Censura philosophiae Cartesianae his Nouveau mémoire pour servir à lhistoire du Cartésianisme and his discussion with Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux on the Sublime.

In the Huetiana of the abbé dOlivet will be found material for arriving at an idea of his prodigious labours exact memory and wide scholarship. Another posthumous work was his Traité philosophique de la faiblesse de lesprit humain which he considered to be his best work. His autobiography found in his Commentarius de rebus ad eum pertinentibus has been translated into French and into English.

The lycée in Hérouville-Saint-Clair Calvados was formerly named after Huet though it has now ceased to be so."
Michel Hulin,"Michel Hulin is a French philosopher specialised on Indian philosophy.

Michel Hulin was born on 31 January 1936. An alumn of the École normale supérieure he obtained his doctorate in philosophy from the Paris-Sorbonne University in 1977 with a dissertation on the Vedic concept of ahamkara. He was a professor of Indian and comparative philosophy at Paris-Sorbonne from 1981 to 1998. His research has focused on classical Indian philosophy such as the nondualism in Vedanta Tantric-inspired texts in Shaivism and the confrontations between European and Asian traditions of thought."
Jean Hyppolite,"Jean Hyppolite was a French philosopher known for championing the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and other German philosophers and educating some of Frances most prominent post-war thinkers. His major works include Genesis and Structure of Hegels Phenomenology of Spirit and Studies on Marx and Hegel.

Hyppolite was born in Jonzac. He was a graduate of the École Normale Supérieure at roughly the same time as Jean-Paul Sartre. After graduation he embarked on a serious study of Hegel teaching himself German in order to read Phenomenology of Spirit in the original. In 1939 he came out with his own translation and his commentary would later form the basis of the book Genesis and Structure of the Phenomenology of Spirit . After the Second World War Hyppolite became a professor at the University of Strasbourg before moving to the Sorbonne in 1949.

In 1952 Hyppolite published Logique et existence a work that may have had a seminal effect on what was to become known as post-structuralism. This book tries to correlate Hegels Phenomenology to his Logics . In doing so it raises the questions of language being and difference that were to become the hallmarks of new French philosophy at the end of the 20th century. The book was reviewed by the philosopher Gilles Deleuze. The translators of the English language edition of the text included Deleuzes review at the end of the volume.

In 1954 he became the director of the ENS and in 1955 produced a study of Karl Marxs earlier more Hegelian period at a time when the French interest in Hegel was at its apogee. In 1963 he was elected to the Collège de France and given a chair in The History of Philosophical Thought.

While philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre were known for producing new works influenced by German philosophy Hyppolite is remembered as an expositor teacher and translator. He influenced a number of thinkers including Gilles Deleuze who studied Hegel under him at the Lycée Henri-IV and Michel Foucault as well as Jacques Derrida Gérard Granel and Étienne Balibar ."
Luce Irigaray,"PsychoanalysisFeminist PhilosophyFeminist TheoryPhilosophyPsychologySchizophrenia 

Luce Irigaray is a Belgian-born French feminist philosopher linguist psycholinguist psychoanalyst and cultural theorist who examined the uses and misuses of language in relation to women. Irigarays first and most well known book published in 1974 was Speculum of the Other Woman which analyzes the texts of Freud Hegel Plato Aristotle Descartes and Kant through the lens of phallocentrism. Irigaray is the author of works analyzing many thinkers including This Sex Which Is Not One which discusses Lacans work as well as political economy; Elemental Passions can be read as a response to MerleauPontys article The IntertwiningThe Chiasm in The Visible and the Invisible and in The Forgetting of Air in Martin Heidegger Irigaray critiques Heideggers emphasis on the element of earth as the ground of life and speech and his oblivion or forgetting of air.

Irigaray employs three different modes in her investigations into the nature of gender language and identity the analytic the essayistic and the lyrical poetic. As of October 2021 she is active in the Womens Movements in both France and Italy.

Luce Irigaray received a bachelors degree from the University of Louvain in 1954 a masters degree from the same university in 1956 and taught at a high school in Brussels from 1956 to 1959.

In 1960 she moved to Paris to pursue a masters degree in Psychology from the University of Paris which she earned in 1961. She also received a specialist diploma in Psychopathology from the school in 1962. In 1968 she received a doctorate in Linguistics from Paris X Nanterre. Her thesis was titled Approche psycholinguistique du langage des déments.

She completed a PhD in linguistics in 1968 from the University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis . Her dissertation on speech patterns of subjects suffering from dementia became her first book Le langage des déments published in 1973. In 1974 she earned a second PhD in Philosophy.

In the 1960s Irigaray started attending the psychoanalytic seminars of Jacques Lacan and joined the École Freudienne de Paris directed by Lacan. She was expelled from this school in 1974 after the publication of her second doctoral thesis Speculum of the Other Woman which received much criticism from both the Lacanian and Freudian schools of psychoanalysis. This criticism brought her recognition but she was removed from her position as an instructor at the University of Vincennes as well as ostracized from the Lacanian community.

She held a research post at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique since 1964 where she is now a Director of Research in Philosophy. Her initial research focused on dementia patients about whom she produced a study of the differences between the language of male and female patients.

It has also been noted that in her writings Irigaray has stated a concern that an interest in her biography would affect the interpretation of her ideas as the entrance of women into intellectual discussions has often also included the challenging of womens point of view based on biographical material. Her most extensive autobiographical statements thus far are gathered in Through Vegetal Being . Overall she maintains the belief that biographical details pertaining to her personal life hold the possibility to be used against her within the male dominated educational establishment as a tool to discredit her work.

Her first major book Speculum of the Other Woman based on her second dissertation was published in 1974. In Speculum Irigaray engages in close analyses of phallocentrism in Western philosophy and psychoanalytic theory analyzing texts by Freud Hegel Plato Aristotle Descartes and Kant. The books most cited essay The Blind Spot of an Old Dream critiques Freuds lecture on femininity.

In 1977 Irigaray published This Sex Which is Not One which was subsequently translated into English with that title and published in 1985 along with Speculum. In addition to more commentary on psychoanalysis including discussions of Lacans work This Sex Which is Not One also comments on political economy drawing on structuralist writers such as Lévi-Strauss. For example Irigaray argues that the phallic economy places women alongside signs and currency since all forms of exchange are conducted exclusively between men.

Irigaray draws upon Karl Marxs theory of capital and commodities to claim that women are exchanged between men in the same way as any other commodity is. She argues that our entire society is predicated on this exchange of women. Her exchange value is determined by society while her use value is her natural qualities. Thus a womans self is divided between her use and exchange values and she is only desired for the exchange value. This system creates three types of women the mother who is all use value; the virgin who is all exchange value; and the prostitute who embodies both use and exchange value.

She further uses additional Marxist foundations to argue that women are in demand due to their perceived shortage and as a result males seek to have them all or seek a surplus like the excess of commodity buying power capital that capitalists seek constantly. Irigaray speculates thus that perhaps the way women are used matter less than their number. In this further analogy of women on the market understood through Marxist terms Irigaray points out that women like commodities are moved between men based on their exchange value rather than just their use value and the desire will always be surplus making women almost seem like capital in this case to be accumulated. As commodities women are thus two things at once utilitarian objects and bearers of value.

Luce Irigarays Elemental Passions could be read as a response to MerleauPontys article The IntertwiningThe Chiasm in The Visible and the Invisible. Like MerleauPonty Irigaray describes corporeal intertwining or vision and touch. Counteracting the narcissistic strain in MerleauPontys chiasm she assumes that sexual difference must precede the intertwining. The subject is marked by the alterity or the more than one and encoded as a historically contingent gendered conflict.

Some of Irigarays books written in her lyrical mode are imaginary dialogues with significant contributors to Western philosophy such as Nietzsche and Heidegger. However Irigaray also writes a significant body of work on Hegel Descartes Plato Aristotle and Levinas Spinoza as well as Merleau-Ponty. Her academic work is largely influenced by a wide range of philosophers and cannot be limited to one approach.

She continued to conduct empirical studies about language in a variety of settings researching the differences between the way men and women speak. This focus on sexual difference is the key characteristic of Irigarays oeuvre since she is seeking to provide a site from which a feminine language can eventuate. Through her research Irigaray discovered a correlation between the suppression of female thought in the Western world and language of men and women. She concluded that there are gendered language patterns that denote dominance in men and subjectivity in women.

Since 1990 Irigarays work has turned increasingly toward women and men together. In Between East and West From Singularity to Community and in The Way of Love she imagines new forms of love for a global democratic community. In An Ethics of Sexual Difference she introduces the idea of relationships between men and women centered around a bond other than reproduction. She acknowledges themes including finiteness and intersubjectivity embodied divinity and the emotional distinction between the two sexes. She concludes that Western culture is unethical due to gender discrimination.

Irigaray is active in a feminist movement in Italy but she refused to belong to any one movement because she does not like the competitive dynamic between the feminist movements.

Some feminists criticize Irigarays perceived essentialist positions. However there is much debate among scholars as to whether or not Irigarays theory of sexual difference is indeed an essentialist one. The perception that her work is essentialist concentrates on her attention to sexual difference taking this to constitute a rehearsal of heteronormative sexuality. As Helen Fielding states the uneasiness among feminists about Irigarays discussion of masculinity and femininity does not so much reveal Irigarays heteronormative bias as much as it arises out of an inherited cultural understanding that posits nature as either unchanging organism or as matter that can be ordered manipulated and inscribed upon. Hence the concern over essentialism is itself grounded in the binary thinking that preserves a hierarchy of...culture over nature.

W. A. Borody has criticised Irigarays phallogocentric argument as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of indeterminateness in the West. Irigarays black and white claims that the masculine equates to determinateness and that the feminine equates to indeterminateness which contain a degree of cultural and historical validity but not when they are deployed to self-replicate a similar form of the gender-othering they originally sought to overcome.

In Fashionable Nonsense Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticized Irigarays use of hard-science terminology in her writings. Among the criticisms they question the purported interest Einstein had in accelerations without electromagnetic reequilibrations; confusing special relativity and general relativity; and her claim that E mc2 is a sexed equation because it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. In reviewing Sokal and Bricmonts book Richard Dawkins wrote that Irigarays assertion that fluid mechanics was unfairly neglected in physics due to its association with feminine fluids was daffy absurdity."

Paul Janet,"Paul Alexandre René Janet was a French philosopher and writer.

Born in Paris he became professor of moral philosophy at Bourges and Strasbourg and of logic at the lycée Louis-le-Grand Paris . In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Sorbonne and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.

He wrote widely on philosophy politics and ethics on idealistic lines La Famille Histoire de la philosophie dans lantiquité et dans le temps moderne Histoire de la science politique Philosophie de la Revolution Française etc. However in the opinion of 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of Victor Cousin and through him of G. W. F. Hegel. His principal work Théorie de la morale owes much to Immanuel Kant."
Pierre Janet,"Pierre Marie Félix Janet was a pioneering French psychologist physician philosopher and psychotherapist in the field of dissociation and traumatic memory.

He is ranked alongside William James and Wilhelm Wundt as one of the founding fathers of psychology.

Janet studied under Jean-Martin Charcot at the Psychological Laboratory in the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. He first published the results of his research in his philosophy thesis in 1889 and in his medical thesis Létat mental des hystériques in 1892. He earned a degree in medicine the following year in 1893.

In 1898 Janet was appointed lecturer in psychology at the Sorbonne and in 1902 he attained the chair of experimental and comparative psychology at the Collège de France a position he held until 1936. He was a member of the Institut de France from 1913 and was a central figure in French psychology in the first half of the 20th century.

Janet was one of the first people to allege a connection between events in a subjects past life and their present-day trauma and coined the words dissociation and subconscious. His study of the magnetic passion or rapport between the patient and the hypnotist anticipated later accounts of the transference phenomenon.

The 20th century saw Janet developing a grand model of the mind in terms of levels of energy efficiency and social competence which he set out in publications including Obsessions and Psychasthenia and From Anguish to Ecstasy among others. In its concern for the construction of the personality in social terms this model has been compared to the social behaviorism of George Herbert Mead something which explains Lacans early praise of Janet who demonstrated so admirably the signification of feelings of persecution as phenomenological moments in social behaviour.

Janet established a developmental model of the mind in terms of a hierarchy of nine tendencies of increasingly complex organisational levels.

He detailed four lower tendencies rising from the reflexive to the elementary intellectual; two middle tendencies involving language and the social world; and three higher tendencies the rational-ergotic world of work and the experimental and progressive tendencies.

According to Janet neurosis could be seen as a failure to integrate or a regression to earlier tendencies and he defined subconsciousness as an act which has kept an inferior form amidst acts of a higher level.

In his 1890 essay The Hidden SelfWilliam James wrote of P. Janets observations of hysterical somnambulist patients at Havre Hospital detailed in Janets 1889 doctorate of letters thesis De lAutomatisme Psychologique. James made note of various aspects of automatism and the apparent multiple personalities of patients variously exhibiting trances subconscious states or alcoholic delirium tremens. James was apparently fascinated by these manifestations and said How far the splitting of the mind into separate conciousnesses may obtain in each one of us is a problem. P. Janet holds that it is only possible where there is an abnormal weakness and consequently a defect of unifying or coordinating power.

Controversy over whose ideas came first Janets or Sigmund Freuds emerged at the 1913 Congress of Medicine in London. Prior to that date Freud had freely acknowledged his debt to Janet particularly in his work with Josef Breuer writing for example of the theory of hysterical phenomena first put forward by P. Janet and elaborated by Breuer and myself. He stated further that we followed his example when we took the splitting of the mind and dissociation of the personality as the centre of our position but he was also careful to point out where the difference lies between our view and Janets.

Writing in 1911 of the neurotics withdrawal from reality Freud stated Nor could a fact like this escape the observation of Pierre Janet; he spoke of a loss of the function of reality and as late as 1930 Freud drew on Janets expression psychological poverty in his work on civilisation.

However in his report on psychoanalysis in 1913 Janet argued that many of the novel terms of psychoanalysis were only old concepts renamed even down to the way in which his own psychological analysis preceded Freuds psychoanalysis. This provoked angry attacks from Freuds followers and thereafter Freuds own attitude towards Janet cooled. In his lectures of 1915-16 Freud said that for a long time I was prepared to give Janet very great credit for throwing light on neurotic symptoms because he regarded them as expressions of idées inconscientes which dominated the patients. However after what Freud saw as his backpedalling in 1913 he said I think he has unnecessarily forfeited much credit.

The charge of plagiarism stung Freud especially. In his autobiographical sketch of 1925 he denied firmly that he had plagiarized Janet and as late as 1937 he refused to meet Janet on the grounds that when the libel was spread by French writers that I had listened to his lectures and stolen his ideas he could with a word have put an end to such talk but did not.

A balanced judgement might be that Janets ideas as published did indeed form part of Freuds starting point but that Freud subsequently developed them substantively in his own fashion.

Carl Jung studied with Janet in Paris in 1902 and was much influenced by him for example equating what he called a complex with Janets idée fixe subconsciente.

Jungs view of the mind as consisting of an indefinite because unknown number of complexes or fragmentary personalities built upon what Janet in Psychological Automatism called simultaneous psychological existences.

Jung wrote of the debt owed to Janet for a deeper and more exact knowledge of hysterical symptoms and talked of the achievements of Janet Flournoy Freud and others in exploring the unconscious.

Alfred Adler openly derived his inferiority complex concept from Janets Sentiment dincomplétude and the two men cited each others work on the issue in their writings.

In 1923 Janet wrote a definitive text on suggestion La médecine psychologique and in 1928-32 published several definitive papers on memory.

While Janet did not publish much in English the 15 lectures that he gave to the Harvard Medical School between 15 October and the end of November 1906 were published in 1907 as The Major Symptoms of Hysteria. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936.

Of his great synthesis of human psychology Henri Ellenberger wrote that this requires about twenty books and several dozen of articles."
Dominique Janicaud,Dominique Janicaud was a French philosopher known for his critical approach to the philosophy of Heidegger. He was the director of its Center for the History of Ideas at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis until 1998 when he was succeeded by André Tosel.
Vladimir Jankélévitch,"Vladimir Jankélévitch was a French philosopher and musicologist.

Jankélévitch was the son of Russian Jewish parents who had emigrated to France.In 1922 he started studying philosophy at the École normale supérieure in Paris under Professor Bergson. In 1924 he completed his DES thesis on Le Traité la dialectique. Ennéade I 3 de Plotin under the direction of Émile Bréhier.

From 1927 to 1932 he taught at the Institut Français in Prague where he wrote his doctorate on Schelling. He returned to France in 1933 where he taught at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and at many universities including Toulouse and Lille. In 1941 he joined the French Resistance. After the war in 1951 he was appointed to the chair of Moral Philosophy at the Sorbonne where he taught until 1978.

In May 1968 he was among the few French professors to participate in the student protests.

The extreme subtlety of his thought is apparent throughout his works where the very slightest gradations are assigned great importance."
Louis de Jaucourt,"Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt was a French scholar and the most prolific contributor to the Encyclopédie. He wrote about 18000 articles on subjects including physiology chemistry botany pathology and political history or about 25 of the entire encyclopaedia all done voluntarily. In the generations after the Encyclopédies mainly due to his aristocratic background his legacy was largely overshadowed by the more bohemian Denis Diderot Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others but by the mid-20th century more scholarly attention was being paid to him.

Jaucourt was born in Paris the youngest son of an aristocratic family. As he could not entirely rely on inheritance or status to support himself Jaucourt became a scholar. He studied theology in Geneva natural sciences at the University of Cambridge and medicine in Leiden. Upon returning to France he spent the next 20 years writing the Lexicon medicum universale a six-volume work on anatomy. He sent it to be published in Amsterdam to avoid French censorship but the ship carrying the sole manuscript sank and 20 years of labour was lost. He also wrote a biography of Leibniz.

He practised medicine and was a Fellow of the Royal Society in London and member of the academies of Berlin Stockholm and Bordeaux. 

Jaucourt volunteered to work on the Encyclopédie recruited by publisher Michel-Antoine David starting with the second volume of the work. He began modestly with only a few articles in each of the next several volumes but gradually became more and more involved. Between 1759 and 1765 he wrote on average 8 encyclopaedia articles per day for a total of 17266 out of 71818 articles making him by far the single most prolific contributor to Encyclopédie. His contributions come to some 4700000 words. He was especially active in the later volumes writing between 30 and 45 of the articles in volumes 10 to 17. This earned him the nickname lesclave de lEncyclopédie .

Unlike other editors Jaucourt was independently wealthy and asked for no payment for his full-time labours. He employed a group of secretaries out of his own pocket to help with the effort and to take his dictation. Most of his works consisted of summarising full books and other longer works into encyclopaedia articles with much content copied verbatim from existing sources earning him the derision of some contributors that favored more original thought.

Jaucourt did not consistently create original articles expressing his own opinions and views of his subjects but rather implicitly showed his personal beliefs through the careful cultivation of certain passages emphasis and reiteration and even word choice. The authors he selected also show how he chose which messages to disseminate under the broader context of each article. For example in his article on Government Jaucourt draws nearly verbatim from the writings of John Locke. Given the politically incendiary tone of the works Jaucourt copied and paraphrased from he concealed the names and publication information of much of his source material. Often to avoid censure the writer would misattribute quotations such as when he borrowed a fellow philosophes quote decrying tyranny and attributed it to Tacitus.

He wrote mainly on the sciences especially medicine and biology. He took a firmly mechanist approach to the subject. This is in sharp contrast to the other major contributor in this area Ménuret de Chambaud who had a firmly vitalist view.

While his main focus was on science and biology he also covered a wide array of other subjects. It is in his works on history and society that his political and philosophical views become clearly evident. He wrote articles of central importance on war monarchy people and Muhammad. His writing is never as openly political as other contributors such as Diderot and Voltaire but it is clear that he possessed deeply held views. Some of his works such as those on historical subjects clearly contain radical and anti-clerical messages through implied comparisons between the ancient past and modern France such as in his article Paris. Presenting criticisms through these parallels allowed Jaucourt to both bypass the censors that plagued most contributors to the Encyclopédie and to allow his commentaries on society in a less overt but still impactful way. Jaucourt also criticized Divination and superstition following Francis Bacon in interpreting superstition primarily as an intellectual error. He also wrote important pieces on slavery the slave trade and black people all strongly condemning slavery as counter to both natural rights and liberties.

Alastair Davidson has stated that though not regarded today as one of the foremost contributors to Enlightenment theory or political thought Jaucourts writings demonstrate great dedication to many Enlightenment principles. As he delineates in his article Traite des nègres he believed that the commodification of human life is abhorrent and that every person has the fundamental right of freedom. He also rejected superstition and held that while superstition should be cast aside even superstitions were preferable to beliefs instilled by coercion or force."
Marc Jean-Bernard,"Marc Jean-Bernard is a French philosopher thinker in International Relations classical musician and musicologist. His published work is notably dedicated to Hermeneutics of Culture. International Politics Theory Aesthetic Theory and Philosophy of Music.His theoretical contributions to the Philosophy of Music presents the particularity to synthesize hermeneutical analytical and cognitive methodologies.Marc Jean-Bernard internally associates theoretical investigation into artisticeducative praxis and concrete institutional action in Puerto Rico .

Marc Jean-Bernard was born in Paris into a family of intellectuals and lawyers . He accomplished his philosophical studies at the Sorbonne Paris 1 where he was strongly influenced by the French philosopher Jacques Bouveresse and by the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch. After working on Hegels Aesthetics his Doctoral Studies and Thesis on Wittgenstein was specifically focused on the aesthetic and cultural resonance of Ludwig Wittgensteins Philosophical corpus in relation with AustrianGerman culture and Music. Marc Jean-Bernard received his Doctorate in Philosophy at the Sorbonne for his thesis on Wittgenstein under the direction of Professor Jacques Bouveresse. At the same time he started an active career as a classical guitarist conductor and musicologist. He started studying Music formally at a very early age and developed since 1978 a career as a classical musician and performed extensively worldwide as a soloist and conductor until 2000. He dedicated as well himself to philosophical academic and diplomatic activities. Since his new public appearance in June 2015 in London Marc Jean-Bernard returned successfully to the concert halls in Europe and South America as a conductor soloist and a lecturer in the frame of Concert-Lectures.

Having been also trained with American composers and virtuosos his strong interest and competencies in South American Music Literature and Culture led him to investigate in a Wittgensteins way -and interpret as well- narrative and mythical dimensions of Latin American Music. His life took on a Latin-American flavor with a move to Colombia where he combined the teaching of Philosophy of Language at the Public University with the post of Dean of the Music Faculty at a leading Conservatory. Until 2004 Marc Jean-Bernards professional life was divided between the worlds of philosophy and music. In that year a third world was added to them with his nomination as ad honorem Consul of France in Puerto Rico.

Marc Jean-Bernards Philosophy could be accurately described as a music-philosophical investigation of understanding and interpreting following the tradition of thinkers such as Merleau-Ponty Wittgenstein Ernst Bloch Adorno and Jankélévitch. Such a philosophical perspective assumes -after Schopenhauer Nietzsche and Wittgenstein- that the blurring of the original unity between Philosophy and Music has to be rethought and overcome. This assumption equally relevant for the Indo- Iranian Japanese and Chinese cosmologies is grounded in western culture on the constructive acknowledgment of the internal relation between the general theory of Lógos and the theory of αρμονια for which the concept of musiké is one of the major dimensions. This theoretical and dialogical perspective with its stress on the relevance of cultural hermeneutics aesthetics and musical thinking for the problem of unity and diversity in culture entails several methodological demands. These tasks can be equally formulated from a phenomenological hermeneutical or grammatical point of view. This open hermeneutics is focused by Marc Jean-Bernard on both practical and theoretical dimensions

The Greek locution Dialegein synthesizes a theoretic set of axiological investigations corresponding to a unified epistemic methodology that embraces Cultural Hermeneutics specifically Aesthetics and Ethics. His construction of ethical and aesthetical responsibility stands as a philosophical cantus firmus for the understanding of cultural polyphony. 

Intentionality and CognitionFirstly Marc Jean-Bernard seeks to provide a philosophical account of cognitive sciences in the field of culture. The extension of research in Philosophy of Mind and Continental Philosophy assigns a theoretical imperative to ethical and cultural investigations in order to grammatically fix the amphibology of explanation. In contrast to the anti-functionalism and anti- physicalism of phenomenology and hermeneutics his research on intentionality and subjectivity induces a deep revision of the dichotomy between the transcendental and analytical accounts of phenomenology. He starts with a clear grammar of the term intentionality unifying its phenomenological and cognitive meaning. Then a non-reductive perspective on Mind and Psychism examines cognitive intentionality and affective intentionality following both the phenomenological description of consciousness and the legacy of Wittgensteins investigations on perception knowledge and psychology.

In his musical or philosophical essays and papers he stressed the relevance of values in the aesthetic experience considered as a counterpoint of hermeneutic gestures. This insight on symbolic consciousness and truth-content of art is exemplified throughout two ontologically interconnected main fields Music and Architecture. Considering the non-representational and representational semantics of Music and Architecture the temporalization and spatialization gestures implied in design and composition embrace the entire sphere of dwelling in a given world what we call an aesthetical oikonomia. This connection between temporality and spatiality is exposed through recent examples where axiological and immunological claims of a harmonic world are creatively expressed. These paradigmatic topics focused on architectural design and musical compositions are chosen between contemporary works from European Japanese North and South American cultures.

Correspondingly he crystallizes the claim for dialogue between cognitive and hermeneutics in Art Ethics and Education. His dialogical perspective entails new methodological demands applied to cultural diversity. Phenomenological grammatical and cognitive approaches of todays Aesthetic Endeavour induce a corresponding insight into the role of effective intentionality in Ethics. He assumes that we are led to a synoptic view of Responsibility within a nonreductive frame. Responsibility linking Wittgenstein to Levinas and phenomenological to cognitive descriptions emphasizes the exigent core of a philosophical telos. This Duty reaffirms Malrauxs meditation in The Twilight of the Absolute through the infinite epiphany of Autrui.

Francis Jeanson,"Francis Jeanson was a French political activist known for his commitment to the FLN during the Algerian war.

Although his fathers name was Henri Francis Jeanson was not related to the Henri Jeanson who was a journalist at Le Canard enchaîné Le Crapouillot and a screenwriter.

During the Second World War he escaped by Spain to flee the Service du travail obligatoire and joined the Armée française de la Libération in 1943.

A reporter for the Alger républicain in 1945 he met Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre and the latter entrusted to him the management of the magazine Les Temps modernes from 1951 to 1956. He wrote the critique of The Rebel which eventually led to ending for good of the relationship between Sartre and Camus.

He became acquainted with Emmanuel Mounier who in 1948 opened for him the doors of the magazine Esprit where there was a certain philocommunism and who facilitated his entry into the intellectual seraglio of the post-war period. Mounier also invited him to the reading committee of the Éditions du Seuil and recommended him to its literary director Paul Flamand. At the death of Mounier in March 1950 Jeanson took over the direction of the series Écrivains de Toujours.

Beginning in 1957 at the height of the Algerian war he put his anti-colonial ideals into practice by creating the Jeanson network to transport funds to the National Liberation Front of Algeria. This clandestine network of militants was disbanded in 1960. Fleeing abroad Francis Jeanson was tried in absentia convicted of high treason and sentenced in October 1960 to ten years imprisonment.

He returned to Paris on the occasion of his amnesty in 1966 then worked with the Théâtre de Bourgogne and was in charge of prefiguring the cultural policy of the Maison de la culture in Chalon-sur-Saône . He proposed and elaborated through this experience the notion of non-public which will be resumed in May 1968 in the Declaration of Villeurbanne of which he was the main editor.

Solicited by psychiatrists he then led interventions for an open psychiatry a psychiatrie du sujet and created in particular the SOFOR which developed training activities for caregivers.

In 1992 he became president of the Sarajevo Association in support of the Bosnian people and was a candidate on the list Europe Begins at Sarajevo of professor Léon Schwartzenberg for the 1994 European Parliament election.

Jeanson appears under the pseudonym Alexandre in Mauriennes book Le déserteur a book forbidden when it was published in 1960 reissued in 2005 by Éditions LEchappée."
Lucien Jerphagnon,"Lucien Jerphagnon was a French scholar historian and philosopher specialized in Greek and Roman philosophy.

Lucien Jerphagnon is the son of Émile Jerphagnon a regional engineer of French Ministry of National Education and Madame Jerphagnon born Jeanne Lallemand.

He became doctor in philosophy under professor Vladimir Jankélévitch and became a lecturer at the University of Franche-Comté of Besançon and professor at the Caen University ."
Jean Jolivet,"Jean Jolivet was a French philosopher and medievalist.He was an authority on Medieval philosophy and honorary director of studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris. He was co-director of the publication series Études de philosophie médiévale for the Vrin Library of philosophy. Jolivet has been an influential mentor for and collaborator with Constant Mews particularly in relation to Peter Abelard.

In 1997 a book was published honoring his work titled Langages et philosophie. Hommage à Jean Jolivet. "
Charles-Étienne Jordan,"Charles-Étienne Jordan was a Prussian-born Huguenot refugee advisor to Frederick the Great and French-language author on literature and history. He is mainly remembered for his Histoire dun voyage litteraire describing his literary visits in France England and the Netherlands.

In 1736 Jordan became the Crown Princes literary secretary in 1740 he was appointed Curator of the Universities and in 1744 Vice President of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. At the Rheinsberg Castle he was the member of a radical intellectual circle including general Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqué. Jordan was an avid collector of banned radical and Socinian books obtaining copies of the Meditationes of Theodor Ludwig Lau Jean Bodins Colloque and Adrian Beverlands État de lhomme for his personal library."
Théodore Simon Jouffroy,"Théodore Simon Jouffroy was a French philosopher.

He was born at Les Pontets Franche-Comté département of Doubs. In his tenth year his father a tax-gatherer sent him to an uncle at Pontarlier under whom he began his classical studies. At Dijon his compositions attracted the attention of an inspector who had him placed in the normal school Paris. There he came under the influence of Victor Cousin and in 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the normal and Bourbon schools.

Three years later being thrown upon his own resources he began a course of lectures in his own house and formed literary connexions with Le Courrier français Le Globe LEncyclopédie moderne and La Revue européenne. The variety of his pursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and modern literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical system represented by Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. The application of common sense to the problem of substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic for him than the scepticism of David Hume which reached him through a study of Kant.

He thus threw in his lot with the Scottish philosophy and his first dissertations are adaptations from Reids Inquiry. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of Stewarts Moral Philosophy demonstrating the possibility of a scientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he began a translation of the works of Reid and in his preface estimated the influence of Scottish criticism upon philosophy giving a biographical account of the movement from Francis Hutcheson onwards. In the following year he was returned to parlement by the arrondissement of Pontarlier; but the work of legislation was ill-suited to him. Yet he attended to his duties conscientiously and ultimately broke his health in their discharge. In 1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at the college of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then published the Mélanges philosophiques a collection of fugitive papers in criticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that he afterwards worked out in metaphysics psychology ethics and aesthetics.

He had already demonstrated in his prefaces the possibility of a psychology apart from physiology of a science of the phenomena of consciousness distinct from the perceptions of sense. He now classified the mental faculties premising that they must not be confounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were according to his analysis personal will primitive instincts voluntary movement natural and artificial signs sensibility and the faculties of intellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe.

In 1835 he published Cours de droit naturel one of his most important works. From the conception of a universal order in the universe he reasons to a Supreme Being who has created it and who has conferred upon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence leading to his highest good. Good he says is the fulfilment of mans destiny evil the thwarting of it. Every man being organized in a particular way has of necessity an aim the fulfilment of which is good; and he has faculties for accomplishing it directed by reason. The aim is good however only when reason guides it for the benefit of the majority but that is not absolute good. When reason rises to the conception of universal order when actions are submitted by the exercise of a sympathy working necessarily and intuitively to the idea of the universal order the good has been reached the true good good in itself absolute good. But he does not follow his idea into the details of human duty though he passes in review fatalism mysticism pantheism scepticism egotism sentimentalism and rationalism.

In 1835 Jouffroys health failed and he went to Italy where he continued to translate the Scottish philosophers. On his return he became librarian to the university and took the chair of recent philosophy at the faculty of letters. He died in Paris. After his death were published Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques and Cours desthetique . The former contributed nothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the distinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his theory of beauty.

Jouffroys claim to distinction rests mainly on his ability as an expositor of other mens ideas. His enthusiasm and his command over the language of popular exposition made him a great international medium for the transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and France and Germany and France; and though his expositions are vitiated by loose reading of the philosophers he interpreted he did some memorable work."
François Jullien,"François Jullien is a French philosopher Hellenist and sinologist.

An alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure and holder of the agrégation Frances professorial degree François Jullien studied Chinese language and thought at Peking University and Shanghai University from 1975 to 1977. He received his French university doctorate in 1978 and his French research doctorate in Far East studies in 1983.

Since then Jullien has been head of the Antenne Française de Sinologie in Hong Kong a guest of the Maison Franco-Japonaise in Tokyo president of the Association Française dEtudes Chinoises director of the East Asia department of Paris Diderot UniversityParis VII president of the Collège International de Philosophie professor at Paris Diderot University and director of both the Institut de la Pensée Contemporaine and the Centre Marcel-Granet.

He was a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France from 2001 to 2011 and is the current Chair of Alterity at the Fondation Maison des Sciences de lHomme .

Jullien has edited several anthologies for the Presses Universitaires de France and for the Agenda de la Pensée Contemporaine the latter published first by PUF then by Éditions Hermann.Several conferences dealing with his philosophy have been held in France and abroad . Among the most recent are

Jullien received the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought in Germany in 2010 and the Grand Prix de Philosophie of the Académie Française for his body of work in 2011.

Marcel Gauchet has summed up François Julliens work in the following terms The work of François Jullien seems to me to follow the grand lines of the unwritten but oh-so-influential program of what I shall call the twentieth-century anthropological school. Primarily but not exclusively French this school came to fruition in the work of Durkheim Mauss Granet Lévi-Strauss and a few others as well. It is in a word the school of Western decentralization. But François Jullien is not content to contribute to this most difficult of enterprises. He has brought the decentralization to its fulfilment for he has turned it back on the West. In particular he has done this in the field of philosophy something no one had ever done before and by taking on Chinas alterity which it must be said provided a privileged standpoint. He has thus carried decentralization further than his predecessors. He has shown us how to look from elsewhere at our most theoretical and abstract thought dealing with the fundamental categories that allow us to apprehend any object spontaneously. He has become the ethnologist of our conceptual universe.

When Jullien was awarded the Grand Prix de Philosophie of the Académie Française Angelo Rinaldi presented his work as follows The variety of subjects this philosopher-sinologist has taken on could lead one to imagine a scattershot oeuvre. On the contrary there is in François Julliens work a strong unity of thought and a clear progression. Pierre Nora sums it up in a phrase the thought that lies between China and Greece. The purpose indeed is to consider the unthought-of in our thought which has arisen on the foundations laid by Greece. To this end China offers an oblique way in a chance to redirect our gaze upon ourselves and see ourselves from without. The priority for François Jullien is to constitute this exteriority and the remainder of his work consists of a reevaluation of the foundations of European thought. Awaiting us at the far end of this road are the general questions that interest us all directly does the universal exist what might we hold in common what is the meaning of unity difference or conformity What we now call the dialogue of cultures is clearly at the center of this philosophers concerns and it is this ever-present theme that makes him relevant for us today.

François Jullien is among the most translated of contemporary thinkers with works appearing in some twenty-five countries. More than twenty of his essays have been translated into German Italian and Spanish and a dozen have been translated into English Chinese Vietnamese and Portuguese.

Since first establishing what he refers to as his philosophical construction yard to explore the écart between Chinese and European thought François Jullien has been organizing a vis-à-vis between cultures rather than comparing them so as to map out a common field for reflection. His work has led him to examine such various disciplines as ethics aesthetics strategy and the systems of thought of both History and nature. The aim of this deconstruction from without is to detect buried biases in both cultures as well as to elucidate the unthought-of in our thought. It serves also to bring out the resources or fecundities of languages and cultures rather than consider them from the perspective of their difference or identity. Moreover it launches philosophy anew by extricating it from the bog of its atavisms and purging it of facile notions .The enterprise has not failed to raise hackles in both philosophical and Orientalist circles. Jullien has argued in response that the way to produce the common is to put écarts to work. Because they establish distance écarts bring out the between and put our reflection into tension. The similar on the other hand produces only what is uniform which we then mistake for universals.Within this construction yard between the languages and systems of thought of China and Europe Jullien has since developed a philosophy of living . This marks a departure from Being the major bias of Greek philosophy. The result is a general philosophy that unfolds as a philosophy of existence. Some of Julliens recent developments in this area include reflections on intimacy and landscape .For a survey of Julliens work see De lÊtre au vivre lexique euro-chinois de la pensée Gallimard 2015.The readership for Julliens work has been expanding of late beyond the disciplines of Orientalism and philosophy.The world of management has begun to adopt such concepts as situational potential as opposed to plans of action; maturation as opposed to projected modelizations; and the initiation of silent transformations to induce change rather than impose it.Cf. A Treatise on Efficacy 2004; Conférence sur lefficacité 2005.The world of psychology and analysis has begun to adopt the concept of silent transformation ; the distinction between the word and speech ; and the concepts of the allusive availability indirectness and obliquity .The art world has begun to adopt the concepts of silent transformation; of the great image ; of soaring and slackness ; of the frontal and the oblique ; of coherence as opposed to sense ; of the evasive as opposed to the assignable; of the allusive as opposed to the symbolic. The art world has also begun to adopt the concepts of the écart and the between . Because it is based on distinction difference specifies an essence and stores it away as knowledge. An écart however establishes a distance and thus maintains a tension between the things it separates. Even while producing its disturbance the écart brings forth a between precisely because of the distance established. If the between is the thing of which ontology cannot conceivebecause it has no in-itself i.e. no essenceit is also the space through which passes or occurs the space of the operatory and the effective.Cf. In Praise of Blandness 1997; The Impossible Nude 2007; The Great Image Has No Form 2012; This Strange Idea of the Beautiful 2016.

François Julliens work has been criticized by certain sinologists chief among them Jean-François Billeter. The two principal texts published by Billeter against Jullien and his method are

François Julliens reply to the charge that he portrays China as an alterity appears in Chemin faisant Connaître la Chine relancer la philosophie. There he argues that the unreferenced quotations used by Jean-François Billeter are fabrications and that Billeter attempts to construct an imaginary version of François Julliens work to argue against. The crux of the matter for Jullien is that exteriority and alterity are not to be conflated. Chinas exteriority Julliens point of departure is he argues evident in its language as well as in its history whereas alterity must be constructed and as internal heterotopia is to be found in both Europe and China. Rather than relegate China to a separate isolated world Jullien claims to weave a problematics between China and Europe a net that can then fish out an unthought-of and help create the conditions for a new reflexivity between the two cultures.

Jullien has dealt with the question of criticizing Chinese ideology several times in his work La Propension des choses chapter II; Le Détour et laccès chapters I to VI; Un sage est sans idée final pages; etc. He thus separates himself from those who out of fascination with strangeness or exoticism have upheld the image of China as an other. He separates himself also from those who like Jean-François Billeter permit themselves to dip into a common fund of thought and thus miss a chance to benefit from the diversity of human thought which for Jullien is its true resource. He argues that we must reject both facile universalism and lazy relativism in favor of a dia-logue of the two cultures the dia of the écart which reveals the fecundity of multiple lines of thought and the logos which allows these lines to communicate through a common intelligence.

Pierre Klossowski,"Pierre Klossowski was a French writer translator and artist. He was the eldest son of the artists Erich Klossowski and Baladine Klossowska and his younger brother was the painter Balthus.

Born in Paris Pierre Klossowski was the older brother of the artist Balthazar Klossowski better known as Balthus. Their parents were the art historian Erich Klossowski and the painter Baladine Klossowska. His German-educated father came from a family supposedly belonging to the former Polish petty nobility and bearing the Rola coat of arms. His mother Baladine Klossowska was born as Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro in Breslau Prussia . When he was 18 Pierre was André Gides secretary and worked on the drafts of Les faux-monnayeurs for him. Klossowski was responsible for a new publication of The 120 Days of Sodom Other Writings by the Marquis de Sade in 1964.

Pierre Klossowski wrote full length volumes on the Marquis de Sade and Friedrich Nietzsche a number of essays on literary and philosophical figures and five novels. Roberte Ce Soir provoked controversy due to its graphic depiction of sexuality. He translated several important texts into French worked on films and was also an artist illustrating many of the scenes from his novels. Klossowski participated in most issues of George Batailles review Acéphale in the late 1930s.

His 1969 book Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle greatly influenced French philosophers such as Michel Foucault Gilles Deleuze and Jean-François Lyotard.

Klossowski also appeared in Robert Bressons Au hasard Balthazar as the avaricious miller who desires Marie a character played by Anne Wiazemsky.

His text on de Sade is mentioned in the bibliography at the beginning of Pier Paolo Pasolinis Salò or the 120 Days of Sodom and quoted several times through the film.

From 20 September to 19 October 2006 there was a display of Klossowskis drawings and life size sculptures made after them with sculptor Jean-Paul Réti along with the art of Hans Bellmer at the Whitechapel Art Gallery also presented at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne and the Musée National dArt Moderne in Paris with a film retrospective.

Sarah Kofman,"Sarah Kofman was a French philosopher .

Kofman began her teaching career in Toulouse in 1960 at the Lycée Saint-Sernin

Kofman did not receive tenure until 1991 when she was appointed to a chair at Paris I.

Kofman was the author of numerous books including several on Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Her book Lénigme de la femme La femme dans les textes de Freud is perhaps the most thorough consideration of Freuds ideas concerning female sexuality.

Though many of her philosophical writings focused on Nietzsche and Freud Kofman wrote several works in an autobiographical vein. Paroles suffoquées is dedicated to the memory of her father rabbi Bereck Kofman whom she saw for the last time on July 16 1942 and who was killed at Auschwitz.

Rue Ordener rue Labat also opens with the removal of her father by the French police and describes what Kofman understands to have been his fate. The title refers to two Parisian streets the address at which her family lived until her fathers arrest; and the address at which she was sheltered for much of the remainder of the war. Kofman was taken in by a Parisian divorcée who became her surrogate mother and whom she called Mémé. The book tells the story of this period and of the custody dispute between Mémé and Kofmans mother following the liberation of Paris.

Kofman committed suicide in 1994. The fact that she did so on the date of Nietzsches 150th birthday has been seen by some writers as significant. After her death Jacques Derrida wrote the following

For she too was without pity if not without mercy in the end for both Nietzsche and Freud whom she knew and whose bodies of work she had read inside and out. Like no one else in this century I dare say. She loved them pitilessly and was implacable towards them at the very moment when giving them without mercy all that she could and all that she had she was inheriting from them and was keeping watch over what they hadwhat they still haveto tell us especially regarding art and laughter.

Note this list does not include portions of books where a translation of the entire book was subsequently published."
Alexandre Kojève,"Alexandre Kojève was a Russian-born French philosopher and statesman whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy particularly via his integration of Hegelian concepts into twentieth-century continental philosophy. As a statesman in the French government he was instrumental in the formation of the European Union.

Kojève was born Aleksandr Vladimirovich Kozhevnikov in Russia to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated at the University of Berlin and Heidelberg Germany. In Heidelberg he completed in 1926 his PhD thesis on the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Solovievs views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of Karl Jaspers. The title of his thesis was Die religiöse Philosophie Wladimir Solowjews . 

Early influences included the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the historian of science Alexandre Koyré. Kojève spent most of his life in France and from 1933 to 1939 delivered in Paris a series of lectures on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegels work Phenomenology of Spirit. After World War II Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners of the European Common Market.

Kojève studied and used Sanskrit Chinese Tibetan Latin and Classical Greek. He was also fluent in French German Russian and English.

Kojève died in Brussels in 1968 shortly after giving a talk at the European Economic Community on behalf of the French government.

Although not an orthodox Marxist Kojeve was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of Hegel reading him through the lens of both Karl Marx and Martin Heidegger. The well-known end of history thesis advanced the idea that ideological history in a limited sense had ended with the French Revolution and the regime of Napoleon and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition. Kojeves end of history is different from Francis Fukuyamas later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a socialist-capitalist synthesis as to a triumph of liberal capitalism.Mark Lilla notes that Kojève rejected the prevailing concept among European intellectuals of the 1930s that capitalism and democracy were failed artifacts of the Enlightenment that would be destroyed by either communism or fascism. In contrast while initially somewhat more sympathetic to the Soviet Union than the United States Kojève devoted much of his thought to protecting western European autonomy particularly so France from domination by either the Soviet Union or the United States. He believed that the capitalist United States represented right-Hegelianism while the state-socialist Soviet Union represented left-Hegelianism. Thus victory by either side he posited would result in what Lilla describes as a rationally organized bureaucracy without class distinctions.

Kojèves lectures on Hegel were collected edited and published by Raymond Aron in 1947 and published in abridged form in English in the now classic Introduction to the Reading of Hegel Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit. His interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including Raymond Queneau Georges Bataille Maurice Merleau-Ponty André Breton Jacques Lacan Raymond Aron Michel Leiris Henry Corbin and Éric Weil. His interpretation of the masterslave dialectic was an important influence on Jacques Lacans mirror stage theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the post-structuralist philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.

Kojeves correspondence with Leo Strauss has been published along with Kojèves critique of Strausss commentary on Xenophons Hiero. In the 1950s Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist Carl Schmitt whose Concept of the Political he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegels text on Lordship and Bondage . Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard.

In addition to his lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit Kojèves other publications include a little noticed book on Immanuel Kant and articles on the relationship between Hegelian and Marxist thought and Christianity. His 1943 book Esquisse dune phenomenologie du droit published posthumously in 1981 elaborates a theory of justice that contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. Le Concept le temps et le discours extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojèves response to Strauss who disputed this notion can be found in Kojèves article The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing.

Kojève also challenged Strauss interpretation of the classics in the voluminous Esquisse dune histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne which covers the pre-Socratic philosophers Plato and Aristotle as well as Neoplatonism. While the first volume of the previous work was still published during his life-time most of his writings remained unpublished until recently. These are becoming the subject of increased scholarly attention. The books that have so far been published are the two remaining volumes of the Esquisse dune histoire raisonnée de la pensée païenne . Several of his shorter texts are also gathering greater attention and some are being published in book form as well.

Kojève had a close and lifelong friendship with Strauss which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that he never would have known what philosophy is without Strauss. In the 1930s the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojeves response to Strauss On Tyranny. Kojève a senior statesman in the French government argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. On the other hand Strauss believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics noting the disastrous results of Plato in Syracuse. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction and coercion of power. In spite of this debate Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact Strauss would send his best students to Paris to finish their education under Kojèves personal guidance. Among these were Allan Bloom who endeavored to make Kojèves works available in English and published the first edition of Kojèves lectures in English and Stanley Rosen.

In 1999 Le Monde published an article reporting that a French intelligence document showed that Kojève had spied for the Soviets for over thirty years. The claims of this document and even its existence are disputed and it has never been released.

In any case Kojèves contribution to international French economic policy was more than substantial. Although Kojève often claimed to be a Stalinist he largely regarded the Soviet Union with contempt calling its social policies disastrous and its claims to be a truly classless state ludicrous. Kojèves cynicism towards traditional Marxism as an outmoded philosophy in industrially well-developed capitalist nations prompted him to go as far as idiosyncratically referring to capitalist Henry Ford as the one great authentic Marxist of the twentieth century. He specifically and repeatedly called the Soviet Union the only country in which 19th-century capitalism still existed. His Stalinism was quite ironic but he was serious about Stalinism to the extent that he regarded the utopia of the Soviet Union under Stalin and the willingness to purge unsupportive elements in the population as evidence of a desire to bring about the end of history and as a repetition of the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution.

In a commentary on Francis Fukuyamas The End of History and the Last Man the traditionalist conservative thinkerRoger Scruton calls Kojève a life-hating Russian at heart a self-declared Stalinist and a civil servant who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in establishing both the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European Economic Community and states his opinion that Kojève was a dangerous psychopath."
Alexandre Koyré,"Alexandre Koyré Koyra ; 29 August 1892 28 April 1964 also anglicized as Alexander Koyre was a French philosopher of Russian Jewish origin who wrote on the history and philosophy of science.

Koyré was born in the city of Taganrog Russia on 29 August 1892 into a Jewish family. His original name was Alexandr Vladimirovich Koyra . In Imperial Russia he studied in Tiflis Rostov-on-Don and Odessa before pursuing his studies abroad. 

At Göttingen Germany he studied under Edmund Husserl and David Hilbert. Husserl did not approve of Koyrés dissertation whereupon Koyré left for Paris to study at the Collège de France and the Sorbonne during the period 19121913 under Bergson Brunschvicg Lalande Delbos and Picavet. Following Husserls Cartesian Meditations a series of lectures given in Paris in February 1929 Koyré met again with Husserl repeatedly.

In 1914 he joined the French Foreign Legion as soon as the war broke out. In 1916 he volunteered for a Russian regiment fighting on the Russian front following a cooperation agreement between the French and Russian governments.

In 1922 Koyré completed his two State doctorate theses. The same year he started teaching in Paris at the École pratique des hautes études and became a colleague of Alexandre Kojève who eventually replaced him as lecturer on Hegel. In 1931 he helped found the philosophical journal Recherches philosophiques. In 1932 the EPHE created a Department of History of Religious Thought in Modern Europe for him to chair. He retained this position until his death.

During the years 193234 193638 and 194041 Koyré taught in Fuad University where along with André Lalande and others he introduced the study of modern philosophy to Egyptian academia. His most important student in Cairo was Abdel Rahman Badawi who is considered the first systematic modern Arab philosopher. Koyré later joined the Egyptian National Committee of the Free French.

During World War II Koyré lived in New York City and taught at the New School for Social Research including a course on Platos Theaetetus together with Leo Strauss and Kurt Riezler in the fall of 1944. After World War II he was a frequent visitor to the United States spending half a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton each year from 1955 to 1962 and also teaching as a visiting professor at Harvard Yale the University of Chicago the University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins. His lectures at Johns Hopkins would form the nucleus of one of his best known publications From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe . Koyré was general secretary and Vice President of the Institut International de Philosophie a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences a recipient of the George Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society and of the Silver Medal of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

Though best known as a philosopher of science Koyré started out as a historian of religion. Much of his originality for the period rests on his ability to ground his studies of modern science on the history of religion and metaphysics.

Koyré focused on Galileo Plato and Isaac Newton. His most famous work is From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe a series of lectures given at The Johns Hopkins University in 1959 on the rise of early modern science and the change of scientists perception of the world during the period from Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno through Newton. Though the book has been widely heralded it was a summation of Koyrés perspective rather than an original new work.

Koyré was suspicious of scientists claims to prove natural or fundamental truths through experiments. He argued these experiments were based on complicated premises and that they tended to prove the outlook behind these premises rather than any real truth. He repeatedly critiqued Galileos experiments claiming that some of them could not have taken place and disputed the results Galileo claimed and which modern historians of science had hitherto accepted.

According to Koyré it was not the experimental or empirical nature of Galileos and Newtons discoveries that carried the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries but a shift in perspective a change in theoretical outlook toward the world. Koyré strongly criticized what he called the positivist notion that science should only discover given phenomena the relations between them and certain laws that would help to describe or predict them. To Koyré science was at its heart theory an aspiration to know the truth of the world of uncovering the essential structures from which phenomena and the basic laws that relate them spring.

Koyré was also interested in the correlations between scientific discoveries and religious or philosophical worldviews. Like Edmund Husserl in his later studies Koyré claimed that modern science had succeeded in overcoming the split inherent in traditional Aristotelian science between Earth and Space since these were now both seen as governed by the same laws. On the other hand another split had now been created between the phenomenal world inhabited by man and the purely abstract mathematical world of science. Koyré aimed to show how this first world the world of human dwelling apparently irrelevant to modern naturalistic research was by no means irrelevant for the very constitution and development of this research. Koyré consistently sought to show how scientific truth is always discovered in correlation with specific historical even purely personal circumstances.

Koyrés work can be seen as a systematic analysis of the constitutive achievements that resulted in scientific knowledge but with particular emphasis on the historical and specifically human circumstances that generate the scientists phenomenal world and serve as foundation for all scientific constitutions of meaning.

Koyré influenced major European and American philosophers of science most significantly Thomas Kuhn Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend. In 1961 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society.

In the course of his studies of Galileo Koyré famously claimed that the experiments with weights falling and rolling on inclined planes that Galileo described in his writings probably had not been carried out in practice but were instead thought experiments intended to illustrate his deductions. Koyré argued that the precision of the results reported by Galileo was not possible with the technology available to him and quoted the contemporary judgement of Marin Mersenne who had questioned the feasibility of reproducing Galileos results. Furthermore according to Koyré Galileos science was largely a product of his Platonist philosophy and did not really derive from experimental observations.

Koyrés conclusions were first challenged in 1961 by Thomas B. Settle who as a graduate student at Cornell University succeeded in reproducing Galileos experiments with inclined planes using the methods and technologies described in Galileos writing. Later Stillman Drake and others worked through Galileos notes and demonstrated that Galileo was a careful experimentalist whose observations did play a pivotal role in the development of his scientific system that he later claimed in his published work. Koyré has been further criticized for his claim about Galileos Platonism which he saw as a synonym with mathematics and mathematization of nature. As the Italian scholar Lodovico Geymonat has proved in fact Platonism as a tradition does not helpfully illuminate the development of Galileos mathematical studies which are mostly concerned with applied mathematics engineering and mechanics fields that neither Plato nor Platonist authors were much interested in."
Julia Kristeva,"Julia Kristeva is a Bulgarian-French philosopher literary critic semiotician psychoanalyst feminist and most recently novelist who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. She is now a professor emerita at the University Paris Diderot. The author of more than 30 books including Powers of Horror Tales of Love Black Sun Depression and Melancholia Proust and the Sense of Time and the trilogy Female Genius she has been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor Commander of the Order of Merit the Holberg International Memorial Prize the Hannah Arendt Prize and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize awarded by the Havel Foundation.

Kristeva became influential in international critical analysis cultural studies and feminism after publishing her first book Semeiotikè in 1969. Her sizeable body of work includes books and essays which address intertextuality the semiotic and abjection in the fields of linguistics literary theory and criticism psychoanalysis biography and autobiography political and cultural analysis art and art history. She is prominent in structuralist and poststructuralist thought.

Kristeva is also the founder of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize committee.

Born in Sliven Bulgaria to Christian parents Kristeva is the daughter of a church accountant. Kristeva and her sister attended a Francophone school run by Dominican nuns. Kristeva became acquainted with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin at this time in Bulgaria. Kristeva went on to study at the University of Sofia and while a postgraduate there obtained a research fellowship that enabled her to move to France in December 1965 when she was 24. She continued her education at several French universities studying under Lucien Goldmann and Roland Barthes among other scholars. On August 2 1967 Kristeva married the novelist Philippe Sollersborn Philippe Joyaux.

Kristeva taught at Columbia University in the early 1970s and remains a Visiting Professor. She has also published under the married name Julia Joyaux.

After joining the Tel Quel group founded by Sollers Kristeva focused on the politics of language and became an active member of the group. She trained in psychoanalysis and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways her work can be seen as trying to adapt a psychoanalytic approach to the poststructuralist criticism. For example her view of the subject and its construction shares similarities with Sigmund Freud and Lacan. However Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense; instead she favors a subject always in process or on trial. In this way she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures whilst preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis. She travelled to China in the 1970s and later wrote About Chinese Women .

One of Kristevas most important contributions is that signification is composed of two elements the symbolic and the semiotic the latter being distinct from the discipline of semiotics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure. As explained by Augustine Perumalil Kristevas semiotic is closely related to the infantile pre-Oedipal referred to in the works of Freud Otto Rank Melanie Klein British Object Relation psychoanalysis and Lacans pre-mirror stage. It is an emotional field tied to the instincts which dwells in the fissures and prosody of language rather than in the denotative meanings of words. Furthermore according to Birgit Schippers the semiotic is a realm associated with the musical the poetic the rhythmic and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the feminine and represents the undifferentiated state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant.

Upon entering the Mirror Stage the child learns to distinguish between self and other and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning known as the symbolic. In Desire in Language Kristeva describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a speaking subject and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language culture meaning and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is contrasted with the semiotic in that it is associated with the masculine the law and structure. Kristeva departs from Lacan in the idea that even after entering the symbolic the subject continues to oscillate between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore rather than arriving at a fixed identity the subject is permanently in process. Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in Black Sun as melancholia given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure.

It has also been suggested that the degradation of women and womens bodies in popular culture emerges because of the threat to identity that the mothers body poses it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semiotic desiring to reunite with the mother while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. Slasher films thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.

Kristeva is also known for her adoption of Platos idea of the chora meaning a nourishing maternal space . Kristevas idea of the chora has been interpreted in several ways as a reference to the uterus as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child and as the temporal period preceding the Mirror Stage. In her essay Motherhood According to Giovanni Bellini from Desire in Language Kristeva refers to the chora as a non-expressive totality formed by drives and their stases in a motility that is full of movement as it is regulated. She goes on to suggest that it is the mothers body that mediates between the chora and the symbolic realm the mother has access to culture and meaning yet also forms a totalizing bond with the child.

Kristeva is also noted for her work on the concept of intertextuality.

Kristeva argues that anthropology and psychology or the connection between the social and the subject do not represent each other but rather follow the same logic the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore in her analysis of Oedipus she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on hisher own but that heshe stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation .

In her comparison between the two disciplines Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine and by this come into being.

Kristeva has been regarded as a key proponent of French feminism together with Simone de Beauvoir Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray. Kristeva has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the US and the UK as well as on readings into contemporary art although her relation to feminist circles and movements in France has been quite controversial. Kristeva made a famous disambiguation of three types of feminism in Womens Time in New Maladies of the Soul ; while rejecting the first two types including that of Beauvoir her stands are sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether. Kristeva proposed the idea of multiple sexual identities against the joined code of unified feminine language.

Kristeva argues her writings have been misunderstood by American feminist academics. In Kristevas view it was not enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed through the prisms of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This post-structuralist approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity and that this political assertion of sexual ethnic and religious identities is ultimately totalitarian.

Kristeva wrote a number of novels that resemble detective stories. While the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects. Her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices making her type of fiction mostly resemble the later work of Dostoevsky. Her fictional oeuvre which includes The Old Man and the Wolves Murder in Byzantium and Possessions while often allegorical also approaches the autobiographical in some passages especially with one of the protagonists of Possessions Stephanie Delacoura French journalistwho can be seen as Kristevas alter ego. Murder in Byzantium deals with themes from orthodox Christianity and politics; she referred to it as a kind of anti-Da Vinci Code.

For her innovative explorations of questions on the intersection of language culture and literature Kristeva was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize in 2004. She won the 2006 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. She has also been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor Commander of the Order of Merit and the Vaclav Havel Prize. On October 10 2019 she received an honoris causa doctorate from Universidade Católica Portuguesa.

Roman Jakobson said that Both readers and listeners whether agreeing or in stubborn disagreement with Julia Kristeva feel indeed attracted to her contagious voice and to her genuine gift of questioning generally adopted axioms and her contrary gift of releasing various damned questions from their traditional question marks.

Roland Barthes comments that Julia Kristeva changes the place of things she always destroys the last prejudice the one you thought you could be reassured by could be take pride in; what she displaces is the already-said the déja-dit i.e. the instance of the signified i.e. stupidity; what she subverts is authority -the authority of monologic science of filiation.

Ian Almond criticizes Kristevas ethnocentrism. He cites Gayatri Spivaks conclusion that Kristevas book About Chinese Women belongs to that very eighteenth century Kristeva scorns after pinpointing the brief expansive often completely ungrounded way in which she writes about two thousand years of a culture she is unfamiliar with. Almond notes the absence of sophistication in Kristevas remarks concerning the Muslim world and the dismissive terminology she uses to describe its culture and believers. He criticizes Kristevas opposition which juxtaposes Islamic societies against democracies where life is still fairly pleasant by pointing out that Kristeva displays no awareness of the complex and nuanced debate ongoing among women theorists in the Muslim world and that she does not refer to anything other than the Rushdie fatwa in dismissing the entire Muslim faith as reactionary and persecutory.

In Intellectual Impostures physics professors Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont devote a chapter to Kristevas use of mathematics in her writings. They argue that Kristeva fails to show the relevance of the mathematical concepts she discusses to linguistics and the other fields she studies and that no such relevance exists.

In 2018 Bulgarias state Dossier Commission announced that Kristeva had been an agent for the Committee for State Security under the code name Sabina. She was supposedly recruited in June 1971. Five years earlier she left Bulgaria to study in France. Under the Peoples Republic of Bulgaria any Bulgarian who wanted to travel abroad had to apply for an exit visa and get an approval from the Ministry of Interior. The process was long and difficult because anyone who made it to the west could declare political asylum. Kristeva has called the allegations grotesque and false. On 30 March the state Dossier Commission began publishing online the entire set of documents reflecting Kristevas activity as an informant of the former Committee for State Security. She vigorously denies the charges.

Neal Ascherson wrote ...the recent fuss about Julia Kristeva boils down to nothing much although it has suited some to inflate it into a fearful scandal... But the reality shown in her files is trivial. After settling in Paris in 1965 she was cornered by Bulgarian spooks who pointed out to her that she still had a vulnerable family in the home country. So she agreed to regular meetings over many years in the course of which she seems to have told her handlers nothing more than gossip about Aragon Bataille Co. from the Left Bank cafés stuff they could have read in Le Canard enchaîné... the combined intelligence value of its product and her reports was almost zero. The Bulgarian security men seem to have known they were being played. But never mind they could impress their boss by showing him a real international celeb on their books..."
Étienne de La Boétie,"La Boétie was born in Sarlat in the Périgord region of southwest France in 1530 to an aristocratic family. His father was a royal official of the Périgord region and his mother was the sister of the president of the Bordeaux Parliament . Orphaned at an early age he was brought up by his uncle and namesake the curate of Bouilbonnas and received his law degree from the University of Orléans in 1553. His great and precocious ability earned La Boétie a royal appointment to the Bordeaux Parliament the following year despite his being under the minimum age. There he pursued a distinguished career as judge and diplomatic negotiator until his untimely death from illness in 1563 at the age of thirty-two. La Boétie was also a distinguished poet and humanist translating Xenophon and Plutarch and being closely connected with the leading young Pleiade group of poets including Pierre de Ronsard Jean Daurat and Jean-Antoine de Baïf. La Boétie was favorable to the conciliation of Catholicism and Protestantism; warned of the dangerous and divisive consequences of permitting two religions which could lead to two opposed states in the same country. The most he would have allowed the Protestants was the right to worship in private and he pointed out their own intolerance of Catholics. His policy for religious peace was one of conciliation and concord through reforms in the church that would eventually persuade the Protestants to reunite with Catholicism. He served with Montaigne in the Bordeaux parlement and is immortalized in Montaignes essay on friendship. Historians often speculate if the two were lovers or not but each played influential roles in each others lives regardless.

To him the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government overlords It is not just fear Boetie explains in the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude for our consent is required. And that consent can be non-violently withdrawn.

It was once thought following Montaignes claims that La Boétie wrote the essay in 1549 at the age of eighteen but recent authorities argue that it is likely that the Discourse was written in 1552 or 1553 at the age of twenty-two while La Boétie was at the university. Some Montaigne scholars have argued that the essay was in fact the work of Montaigne himself. The essay was circulated privately and not published until 1576 after La Boéties death. He died in Germignan near Bordeaux in 1563. His last days are described in a long letter from Montaigne to his own father.

In the 20th century many European anarchists began to cite La Boétie as an influence including Gustav Landauer Bart de Ligt and Simone Weil.Autonomist Marxist thinker John Holloway also cites him in his book Crack Capitalism in order to explain his idea of breaking with capitalism.Gene Sharp the leading theorist of nonviolent struggle cites his work frequently in both The Politics of Nonviolent Action and From Dictatorship to Democracy."
Henri Laborit,"Henri Laborit was a French surgeon neurobiologist writer and philosopher. In 1952 Laborit was instrumental in the development of the drug chlorpromazine published his findings and convinced three psychiatrists to test it on a patient resulting in great success. Laborit was recognized for his work but as a surgeon searching for an anesthetic he became at odds with psychiatrists who made their own discoveries and competing claims.

Laborit wrote several books where he vulgarizes his ethological laboratory research and marries it through systems thinking with knowledge from several other disciplines being a strong advocate of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. His writings can also be found to have deep roots in anarchist thought. He was personally untroubled by the requirements of science and the constraints of university life. He maintained an independence from academia and never sought to produce the orderly results that science requires of its adherents.

Henri Laborit was born in Hanoi French Indochina in 1914. His father was a physician and colonial officer who died in 1920 from tetanus. Laborit contracted tuberculosis at age 12. In Paris he earned a baccalaureate. He spent two years in Indochina on a hospital ship. He passed the examinations at the Naval Health Service in Bordeaux and became a navy physician. He was sent to Sidi Abdallah Bizerte. Feeling that his options for recognition would be better he switched to become a surgeon. During World War II he was stationed on the torpedo boat Sirocco where he witnessed the evacuation of the Dunkerque and then was sunk by the Germans. He was saved by an English sloop that picked him up. He received the French Military Cross with distinction. He was later stationed in Dakar. By about 1949 he was appointed to Val-de-Grâce hospital in Paris.

Laborit was the first to recognize the potential psychiatric uses of chlorpromazine.The science of anesthesiology was new since the 1930s. Surgeons were sometimes responsible for anesthetics and as a French navy surgeon Laborit had seen patients die as a result of or after their operations. He became a researcher in anesthesiology. Laborits ideas on anesthesia included potentiated anaesthesia lowering basal metabolism and lowering body temperature . He advocated the use of procaine synthetic antihistamines Diparcol tetraethylammonium bromide and vitamin B1. He did not like to use morphine. In his years in Bizerte he became interested in the use of the antihistamine promethazine to make patients more relaxed before surgery and in contributing to anesthesia observations that were the forerunner of his later interest in chlorpromazine.

With Pierre Huguenard Laborit invented the lytic cocktail a combination of drugs that could be given to patients to reduce the shock and stress they experienced during and after surgery. Huguenard had success with a combination of promethazine and pethidine at the time under the trade names Diparcol and Dolossal and told Laborit of his finding. Laborit thought that putting patients into a state of artificial hibernation would prevent some aspects of stress reactions. These drugs made bodies stop their reactions to cooling.

Laborit suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they create antihistamines that optimized stabilization of the central nervous system. There chemist Paul Charpentier headed a group trying to improve on the existing drug diphenhydramine . So Charpentier created a new series of phenothiazines one of them by adding a chlorine atom.Simone Courvoisier tested the series on laboratory rats and discovered that RP 4560 could reverse the effects of epinephrine and could induce a state of apathy or indifference. Rhône-Poulenc marketed the drug in Europe for vomiting pain nausea and convulsions as Largactil in 1952. Laborit is said to have named the drug a blended word for large activity.

He Huguenard and an associate named R. Alluaume published A new vegetative stabilizer 4560 RP. in La Presse Médicale in February 1952. According to Max Bennett the effect of the drug to produce disinterest is mentioned together with the possibility that this property might make it of psychiatric use.

Immediately following its synthesis at Rhône-Poulenc in December 1951 Laborit requested a sample of 4560 RP to test for the purpose of reducing shock in injured soldiers. His observation that people treated with this drug showed reduced interest in their surroundings led him to suggest the first test of antipsychotics by Hamon Paraire and Velluz. A 24-year-old patient with mania was released from Val-de-Grâce and ready to resume a normal life after 20 days treatment with chlorpromazine and barbiturates.

Although it had severe side effects chlorpromazine helped change the face of serious mental illness and allowed many patients to live outside mental asylums; in the United States the inpatient population of mental institutions dropped from 559000 in 1955 to 452000 ten years later.

Laborit shared the prestigious Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 1957 with Pierre Deniker and Heinz Lehmann for contributions towards the general use of chlorpromazine. No one won a Nobel Prize for the discovery and Jean Delay of the Sainte-Anne Hospital Center who wanted to win himself sat on the Nobel committee but was opposed to giving it to Laborit. Laborit found himself at odds with Sainte-Anne hospitals staff for the rest of his life.

In 1957 the Lasker Foundation also recognized Nathan S. Kline and Robert H. Noce both of whom advanced reserpine as a treatment for mental illness as well as Rustom Jal Vakil for treating hypertension with reserpine and unrelated Richard E. Shope for pioneering our understanding of viruses.

Laborit became director of the Laboratoire dEutonologie at Boucicault Hospital in Paris. His interests included psychotropic drugs and memory.

Alexander Zaytsev synthesized GHB in 1874 and Laborit synthesized the drug in 1960. He was researching GHB as a precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA. Laborit published Sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate in the International Journal of Neuropharmacology in September 1964.

Laborit received the Croix de Guerre with distinction. He was elected a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1953. He received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award which he shared in 1957 after traveling to the United States on behalf of Rhône-Poulenc.

Laborits ideas are the substance of the Alain Resnais 1980 film Mon oncle dAmérique in which he plays himself.

Laborit interviewed Salvador Dalí about one of his books which Dalí had read but did not understand.

Healy wrote that Laborit felt cheated of his recognition and that he died a bitter man. Healy noted a few attempts to set the record straight a 1980 book by Jean Thuillier that credits Delay and Deniker and Laborit a 1960s book by Ann Caldwell that sided with Laborit and a 1974 book by Judith Swazey Chlorpromazine in Psychiatry which gave credit to both sides. A 1992 commemoration by Rhône-Poulenc gave Laborit credit for anesthesia but gave Deniker and Delay credit for application of chlorpromazine to psychiatry. In 1994 on the 200th anniversary of the founding of Val-de-Grâce a plaque was placed there commemorating the discovery of chlorpromazine by Laborit Harmon Paraire and Velluz in 1952.

Laborit was one of the pioneers of complexity theory and self-organization in France and the initiator of complex thought in his meetings with the Groupe des Dix. Complex thought was later popularized by Edgar Morin."
Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers,"Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers was a French writer art critic pacifist and anarchist.

Lacaze-Duthiers an art critic for the Symbolist review journal La Plume was influenced by Oscar Wilde Nietzsche and Max Stirner. His LIdeal Humain de lArt helped found the Artistocracy movement - a movement advocating life in the service of art. His ideal was an anti-elitist aestheticism All men should be artists. Together with André Colomer and Manuel Devaldes he founded LAction dArt an anarchist literary journal in 1913.

He was a contributor to the Anarchist Encyclopedia. After World War II he contributed to the journal LUnique."
Jean Lacoste,Jean Lacoste is a French-German philosopher scholar and essayist. He is known for his research on Nietzsche Goethe Walter Benjamin and Ernst Cassirer. He is currently a philosophy professor at the Ecole Normale Supérieure.
Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe,"Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe was a French philosopher. He was also a literary critic and translator. Lacoue-Labarthe published several influential works with his friend Jean-Luc Nancy.

Lacoue-Labarthe was influenced by and wrote extensively on Martin Heidegger Jacques Derrida Jacques Lacan German Romanticism Paul Celan and Gérard Granel. He also translated works by Heidegger Celan Friedrich Nietzsche Friedrich Hölderlin and Walter Benjamin into French.

Lacoue-Labarthe was a member and president of the Collège international de philosophie.

Lacoue-Labarthe wrote several books and articles in collaboration with Jean-Luc Nancy a colleague at the Université Marc Bloch in Strasbourg. Early collaborations included Le Titre de la lettre une lecture de Lacan and LAbsolu littéraire théorie de la littérature du romantisme allemand .

In 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy organized a conference at Cerisy-la-Salle centered around Derridas 1968 paper Les fins de lhomme. Following this conference and at Derridas request in November 1980 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy founded the Centre de recherches philosophiques sur le politique . The Centre operated for four years pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions. During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers together and separately. Some of these texts appear in Les Fins de lhomme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida colloque de Cerisy 23 juillet-2 août 1980 Rejouer le politique La retrait du politique and Le mythe nazi . Many of these texts are gathered in translation in Retreating the Political .

In 1986 Lacoue-Labarthe published a book on Celan and Heidegger entitled La poésie comme expérience . Lacoue-Labarthe received his doctorat détat in 1987 with a jury led by Gérard Granel and including Derrida George Steiner and Jean-François Lyotard. The monograph submitted for that degree was La fiction du politique a study of Heideggers relation to National Socialism. These works predate the explosion of interest in the political dimensions of Heideggers thought which followed the publication of a book by Victor Farías.

In Poetry as Experience Lacoue-Labarthe argued that even though Celans poetry was deeply informed by Heideggers philosophy Celan was long aware of Heideggers association with the Nazi party and therefore fundamentally circumspect toward the man and transformative in his reception of his work. Celan was nonetheless willing to meet Heidegger. Heidegger was a professed admirer of Celans writing although Celans poetry never received the kind of philosophical attention which Heidegger gave to the work of poets such as Friedrich Hölderlin or Georg Trakl. Celans poem Todtnauberg however seems to hold out the possibility of a rapprochement between their work. In this respect Heideggers work was perhaps redeemable for Celan even if that redemption was not played out in the encounter between the two men. 

Lacoue-Labarthe considered that Heideggers greatest failure was not his involvement in the National Socialist movement but his silence on the extermination and his refusal to engage in a thorough deconstruction of Nazism. He also believed however that Heideggers thought offers pathways to a philosophical confrontation with Nazism pathways which Heidegger failed to follow but which Lacoue-Labarthe did attempt to pursue.

Lacoue-Labarthe was also involved in theatrical productions. He translated Hölderlins version of Antigone and collaborated with Michel Deutsch on 15 and 30 June 1978. Lacoue-Labarthe and Deutsch returned to the Théâtre national de Strasbourg to collaborate on a 1980 production of Euripides Phoenician Women. Lacoue-Labarthes translation of Hölderlins version of Oedipus Rex was staged in Avignon in 1998 with Charles Berling in the title role."

Joseph Lakanal,"Joseph Lakanal was a French politician and an original member of the Institut de France.

Born in Serres in present-day Ariège his name was originally Lacanal and was altered to distinguish him from his Royalist brothers. He studied theology and joined one of the teaching congregations and for fourteen years taught in their schools. He was professor of rhetoric at Bourges and of philosophy at Moulins.

He was elected by his native département to the National Convention of the French Republic in 1792 where he sat until 1795; Lakanal was one of the noted administrators of the French Revolution. At the time of his election he was acting as vicar to his uncle Bernard Font the constitutional bishop of Pamiers. In the Convention he sat with The Mountain and voted for the execution of King Louis XVI.

Lakanal became a member of the Committee of Public Instruction early in 1793 and after carrying many useful decrees on the preservation of national monuments on the military schools on the reorganization of the Jardin des Plantes as the Muséum national dHistoire naturelle and other matters he brought forward on June 26 his Projet déducation nationale which proposed to lay the burden or primary education on the public funds but to leave secondary education to private enterprise; public fêtes were also assigned specified sums and a central commission was to be entrusted with educational questions.

The project to which Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès also contributed was refused by the Convention who submitted the whole question to a special Commission of six which under the influence of Maximilien Robespierre adopted a report by Louis-Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau .

Lakanal who was a member of the commission now began to work for the organization of higher education and abandoning the principle of his Projet advocated the establishment of state-aided schools for primary secondary and university education. In October 1793 he was sent by the Convention to the south-western départements and did not return to Paris until after the revolution of Thermidor that toppled Robespierre.

He became president of the Education Committee and promptly abolished the system which had had Robespierres support. He drew up schemes for normal schools of départements for primary schools and central schools; Lakanal accepted resolutions against his own system but continued his educational reforms after his election to the Council of the Five Hundred in 1795.

In 1799 he was sent by the Directory to organize the defence of the four départments on the left bank of the Rhine threatened by the invasion of counter-Revolution forces .

Under the Consulate and Empire Lakanal resumed his professional work as a professor at the Lycée Charlemagne and after the battle of Waterloo he retired to the United States. He was welcomed there by President James Madison and the United States Congress gave him a grant of 500 acres in the Vine and Olive Colony in Alabama. He then later became a planter therefore owning slaves and was afterward chosen president of the University of Louisiana that he reorganized with the support of local masonic lodges known today as Tulane University.

He returned to France in 1834 and published in 1838 an Expos sommaire des travaux de Joseph Lakanal. Shortly afterwards in spite of his advanced age Lakanal married a second time. He died in Paris; his widow died in 1881. Lakanals éloge at the Academy of Moral and Political Science of which he was a member was pronounced by the Comte de Rémusat and a Notice historique by François Mignet was read on May 2 1857.

Probably initiated at a Moulins lodge between 1786 and 1788 Lakanal was member of Le point parfait lodge in Paris from 1790. After the Revolution he created two High Degree Chapters La Triple Harmonie and LAbeille Impériale."
André Lalande (philosopher),"André Lalande was a French philosopher. In 1904 he was appointed Professor of philosophy at the University of Paris.

Whilst still at school in 1883-4 he was taught by Émile Durkheim whom he greatly appreciated. His notes have provided the basis for the publication Durkheims Philosophy Lectures Notes from the Lycée de Sens Course 18831884 in 2004.

His doctoral thesis was entitled Lidée directrice de la dissolution opposée à celle de lévolution. In 1901 he was one of the founders of the French Philosophical Society. "
Charles Lalo,"Charles Lalo was a French writer on aesthetics.

Lalo studied philosophy and educational theory in Bayonne and Paris gaining a doctorate at the Sorbonne. After being a schoolmaster he succeeded Victor Basch in the chair of aesthetics at the Sorbonne which he held from 1933 until his death."
Bianca Lamblin,"Bianca Lamblin was a French writer who had affairs with philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir for a number of years. In her book Mémoires dune Jeune Fille Dérangée she wrote that while a student at Lycée Molière she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir who was in her 30s. In correspondence between Sartre and Beauvoir the pseudonym Louise Védrine was used when referring to Bianca in Lettres au Castor and Lettres à Sartre.

Bianca Lamblin was born in 1921 in Lublin to Jewish parents. She was a cousin of the French writer Georges Perec. In 1937 her teacher was Simone de Beauvoir. She also met Sartre at this time. In Paris Bianca was friends with Jean Kanapa Yvonne Picard Raoul Lévy and Bernard Lamblin. She married Bernard Lamblin and they had two children. Bianca became a teacher and after Simone de Beauvoirs death Bianca wrote Mémoires dune jeune fille dérangée."
Félicité de La Mennais,"Félicité Robert de La Mennais was a French Catholic priest philosopher and political theorist. He was one of the most influential intellectuals of Restoration France. Lamennais is considered the forerunner of liberal Catholicism and social Catholicism.

His opinions on matters of religion and government changed dramatically over the course of his life. He initially held rationalistic views but in part due to the influence of his brother Jean-Marie came to see religion as an antidote for the anarchy and tyranny unleashed by revolution. He derided Napoleon in part because of the Organic Articles in which France acting unilaterally amended the Concordat of 1801 between France and the papacy. Lamennais assailed the Gallican view of the relationship between civil authority and the Church and was for a time a staunch ultramontane.

Lamennais was ordained a priest in 1817 the same year he published Essai sur lindifférence en matière de religion. In 1830 he founded LAmi de lordre with Montalembert and Lacordaire. His social ideas embraced an enlarged suffrage separation of church and state universal freedom of conscience instruction assembly and the press. His radicalism distanced him from a number of his friends. In 1833 he broke with the Church and the following year published Paroles dun croyant which Pope Gregory XVI condemned for its philosophical theories.

He served as a deputy for Paris to the Constituent Assembly; his draft for a Constitution was rejected as too radical. He died in Paris in 1854.

Félicité Robert de la Mennais comes from a family from Saint-Malo engaged in international maritime trade.

Louis-François Robert de La Mennais his paternal grandfather was the founder of the Compagnie commerciale et maritime in Saint-Malo. He is a trader and he arms boats for the needs of trade in order to provide all the equipment provisions sometimes even a few cannons to choose a serious captain who knows how to recruit a crew in order to maintain counters in foreign ports. Its a job that requires a certain daring and temerity. Then when his sons were old enough to take responsibility he handed over the administration of the company to them.

Pierre Lorin his maternal grandfather is a lawyer at the Parliament of Paris and Subdelegate of the Jurisdictions of Saint-Malo that is to say representative of the royal power for the district of Saint-Malo which at the time corresponded to about thirty parishes. He worked under the orders of the Intendant of Brittany. A man of heart he has a great social sense and works against the suffering and poverty which were great especially in the countryside. He advocates for example in each parish the establishment of a charity office. He acquired La Chésnaie in 1781 he built a bourgeois house there it was in this place that Félicité would later found a school of theological thought.

The two sisters Gratienne Lorin and Félicité Lorin were married on the same day September 5 1775 in Saint-Malo with the two sons Robert Pierre -Louis Robert de la Mennais and Denis Robert des Saudrais.

Félicité is one of the five children of Pierre-Louis Robert sieur de La Menais and of Gatienne Lorin who died in 1787 when he was five years old so that he was brought up by one of his uncles.

Lamennais was born at Saint-Malo in the ancient Province of Brittany on 19 June 1782 the son of a wealthy merchant who had recently received a coat of arms from the king. He lost his mother at the age of five and as a result he and his brother Jean-Marie were sent for education to an uncle Robert des Saudrais at La Chênaie an estate near Saint-Malo. Resistant to any kind of discipline his uncle would lock him in the library where he spent long hours reading Rousseau and Pascal among others and acquired a vast and varied learning. Revolution was to have a profound effect on Lammennais. His family sheltered non-juring priests. Father Vielle said Mass on occasion in the dark at La Chênaie.

Of a sickly and sensitive nature and shocked by the events of the French Revolution Lamennais developed a morbid frame of mind. He first held rationalistic views but partly through the influence of his brother Jean-Marie and partly as a result of his philosophical and historical studies he came to see the power of faith and religion. He voiced his convictions in Réflexions sur létat de léglise en France pendant le 18ieme siècle et sur sa situation actuelle published anonymously in Paris in 1808. The idea for this work and the materials were due to Jean-Marie but the actual writing was done almost exclusively by Félicité. It recommended religious revival and active clerical organization and the awakening of an ultramontane spirit.Napoleons police deemed the book dangerously ideological and tried to suppress it.

Lamennais devoted most of the following year to translating Louis de Bloiss Speculum Monachorum into French which he published in 1809 under the title Le Guide spirituel.

In 1811 Lamennais received the tonsure and became professor of mathematics in an ecclesiastical college at Saint-Malo founded by his brother who had been ordained a Catholic priest in 1804. When the school was closed by imperial authority the following year Félicité withdrew to La Chênaie while his brother became vicar-general of the diocese of Saint-Brieuc.

In 1814 he published with his brother De la tradition de lÉglise sur linstitution des évêques in which he strongly condemned Gallicanism and the interference of political authority in ecclesiastical affairs. It was provoked by Napoleons nomination of Jean Siffrein Maury as Archbishop of Paris in accordance with the provisions of the Concordat of 1801.

Lamennais hailed the Bourbon restoration of 1814 which he witnessed in Paris because he saw Louis XVIII as a force for religious regeneration. During the Hundred Days he escaped to London where he worked in Kensington at an institution for the children of poor immigrants. After the final overthrow of Napoleon in 1815 he returned to Paris. Lamennais sought in religion a remedy for the anarchy and tyranny unleashed by the revolution. He undertook the study of theology and was ordained a subdeacon on 21 December. At this time he considered joining the Jesuits however the prospect of a novitiate year led him to decide to become a secular priest. It was in Saint-Brieuc in February 1816 that Lamennais received the diaconate. He was ordained by the Bishop of Rennes on 9 March 1817.

The first volume of his great work Essai sur lindifference en matière de religion or Essay on Indifference in Matters of Religion appeared in 1817 and established his reputation throughout Europe. He became according to Lacordaire a humble priest with all the authority once enjoyed by Bossuet. His experience of Napoleon persuaded him that the state had no right to interfere in religion. Lamennais denounced religious indifference by the state and toleration while advocating for a restoration of the pre-Revolutionary authority of the Catholic Church. He contended that private judgment introduced by Martin Luther into religion by Descartes and Leibniz into philosophy and science and by Rousseau and the Encyclopedists into politics had resulted in practical atheism and spiritual death. He asserted that ecclesiastical authority founded on the absolute revelation delivered to the Jewish people but supported by the universal tradition of all nations was the sole hope of regenerating the European communities.

Three more volumes followed and met with a mixed reception from the Gallican bishops and monarchists but with the enthusiastic support from the younger clergy. Three Roman theologians examined his work and Pope Leo XII gave it his formal approval. Lamennais visited Rome at the popes request. He was offered but refused membership in the College of Cardinals.

Lamennais also published works of piety for example a widely read French version of The Imitation of Christ with notes and reflections Guide du premier âge Journée du Chrétien and Recueil de piété . The failure of a publishing house aimed at spreading this pious literature resulted in his own financial ruin.

On his return to France he took a prominent part in political work. Together with Chateaubriand and the Comte de Villèle he was a regular contributor to Le Conservateur littéraire. However when Villèle became the chief supporter of absolute monarchy Lamennais withdrew his support and started two rival organs Le Drapeau blanc and Le Mémorial catholique. He authored a pamphlet criticizing the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Law introduced by Villèles administration. Various other minor works together with De la religion considérée dans ses rapports avec lordre civil et politique kept his name before the public.

He retired to La Chênaie and gathered a group of disciples including Montalembert Lacordaire and Maurice de Guérin. He espoused ultramontanism and aimed to create an organized body of opinion to campaign against Gallicanism the control and influence of the state in church matters. Les Progrès de la revolution et de la guerre contre léglise or On the Progress of the Revolution and the War against the Church marked his complete renunciation of royalist principles and from that time on he advocated on behalf of a theocratic democracy.

J.P.T Bury suggests that Lamennais and his associates found inspiration in a Belgian Liberal Catholic movement centered in Malines and led by Archbishop de Méans vicar-general Engelbert Sterckx. Largely Catholic Belgium seceded from the Netherlands in 1830 and established a constitutional monarchy. Sterckx who became archbishop in 1832 found a way not merely to tolerate the new liberal constitution but to expand the Church under the new liberties guaranteed.

Lamennais founded LAmi de lordre the first issue of which appeared on 16 October 1830 with the motto God and Liberty. His social theories became more radical. The paper was aggressively democratic demanding rights of local administration an enlarged suffrage separation of church and state universal freedom of conscience instruction assembly and the press. Styles of worship were to be criticized improved or abolished in absolute submission to the spiritual not to the temporal authority. His views were opposed by the bishops and supported by the younger clergy but he lost even their support when he said priests should not be paid by the state. With the help of Montalembert he founded the Agence générale pour la défense de la liberté religieuse which became a far-reaching organization with agents throughout France who monitored violations of religious freedom. As a result the periodicals career was stormy and its circulation opposed by conservative bishops.

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy Pope Gregory XVI would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter. However Lamennais Montalembert and Lacordaire suspended their work and in November 1831 set out to Rome to obtain the Popes approval. Archbishop Quélen of Paris had warned Lammenais that he was being unrealistic and was viewed as a demagogue in favor of revolution. As Quelen was a Gallican Lammenais ignored him. After much opposition they gained an audience but only on condition that their political project should not be mentioned. Metternich whose Austrian troops ensured the stability of the Papal States pressed for a condemnation. A few days later they received a letter from Cardinal Pacca advising their departure from Rome and suggesting that the Holy See while admitting the justice of their intentions would like the matter left open for the present.

Lacordaire and Montalembert departed immediately but Lamennais stayed on until Gregorys letter to the Polish bishops which denounced the Polish revolution against the Tsar dashed his last hopes. Gregory thought the Polish revolutionaries were seeking to undermine Russian Tsar Nicholas Is efforts to support the Catholic royalist cause in France by forcing him to divert his troops to suppress the uprising in Poland. While staying in Munich Lamennais received the 1832 encyclical Mirari vos which condemned religious pluralism in general and certain of Lamennaiss ideas advanced in LAvenir without mentioning his name. After this Lamennais and his two lieutenants declared that out of deference to the pope they would not resume the publication of LAvenir and dissolved the Agence générale as well.

Lamennais retired to La Chênaie an estate near Saint-Malo Brittany. He communicated his resentment and political beliefs only through correspondence. The Vatican in turn demanded his frank and full adhesion to the encyclical Mirari vos. Lamennais refused to submit without qualification and in December 1833 renounced his ecclesiastical functions and abandoned all external profession of Christianity.

In May 1834 Lamennais penned Paroles dun croyant or Words of a Believer a collection of aphorisms that denounced the established social orderwhat he called the conspiracy of kings and priests against the peopleand declared his rupture with the Church. In the encyclical Singulari nos of 25 June 1834 Pope Gregory XVI condemned the book as small in size enormous in wickedness and censured Lamennais philosophical system.

Paroles was inspired by Adam Mickiewiczs Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego . The Paroles marked Lamennais turn to a Christian socialism that inspired a whole generation of socialists. His radical ideas reflected an overlap of Catholic and socialist discourses that can be traced back to the 1820s.

Sometime after 5 April 1836 he was imprisoned at Ste. Pelagie a prison for debtors.

Lamennais was increasingly abandoned by his friends and in 1837 published Les Affaires de Rome des maux de lÉglise ci de la société in which he provided his perspective on his relations with Gregory XVI.

After this Lamennais penned several articles in the Revue des Deux Mondes the Revue du Progrès and Le Monde and published the pamphlets Le Livre du peuple De lesclavage moderne Politique a lusage du peuple Discussions critiques Du passé et de lavenir du peuple Amschaspands et Darvands in which he espoused popular sovereignty and attacked contemporary society and the public authorities. After the publication of Le Pays et le gouvernement he was censored and imprisoned for a year in 1841.

From 1841 to 1846 Lamennais published the four volumes of Esquisse dune philosophie a treatise on metaphysics which detailed his departure from Christianity. The third volume an exposition of art as a development of the aspirations and needs of worship formed its core. Lamennais also published Les Evangiles a French translation of the Gospels with added notes and reflections.

In 1846 Lamennais published Une voix de prison written during his imprisonment.

Lamennais sympathized with the Revolution of 1848 and was elected a deputy for Paris to the Constituent Assembly. He drew up a plan for a Constitution which was rejected as too radical. After this he confined himself to silent participation in the sessions. He also started the newspapers Le Peuple constituant and La Révolution démocratique et sociale espousing radical revolution. Both papers quickly ceased publication. He was also named president of the Société de la solidarité républicaine. He remained a deputy in the legislative assemblies until Napoleon IIIs 1851 coup which depressed and isolated him once more.

After 1851 he occupied himself with La Divine Comédie a translation of Dantes Divine Comedy and refused several attempts to reconcile him to the Church. He died in Paris in 1854 and was buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in a common grave without funeral rites mourned by political and literary admirers.

There are two complete works in ten volumes the first published in 18361837 as Œuvres complètes de La Mennais the second published in 1844 as Œuvres complètes de Lamennais. Both are incomplete."
François de La Mothe Le Vayer,"François de La Mothe Le Vayer was a French writer who was known to use the pseudonym Orosius Tubero. He was admitted to the Académie française in 1639 and was the tutor of Louis XIV.

Le Vayer was born and died in Paris a member of a noble family of Maine. His father was an avocat at the parlement of Paris and author of a curious treatise on the functions of ambassadors entitled Legatus seu De legatorum privilegiis officio et munere libellus and illustrated mainly from ancient history. Francois succeeded his father at the parlement but gave up his post about 1647 and devoted himself to travel and belles lettres.

His Considérations sur léloquence française procured him admission to the Académie française and his De linstruction de Mgr. le Dauphin attracted the attention of Richelieu. In 1649 Anne of Austria entrusted him with the education of her second son and subsequently with the completion of Louis XIVs education which had been very much neglected. The outcome of his pedagogic labors was a series of books comprising the Géographie Rhétorique Morale Economique Politique Logique and Physique du prince . The king rewarded his tutor by appointing him historiographer of France and councillor of state. La Mothe Le Vayer inherited of Marie de Gournays library itself transmitted from Michel de Montaigne.

Modest sceptical and occasionally obscene in his Latin pieces and in his verses he made himself a persona grata at the French court where libertinism in ideas and morals was hailed with relish. Besides his educational works he wrote Jugement sur les anciens et principaux historiens grecs et latins ; a treatise entitled Du peu de certitude quil y a en histoire which in a sense marks the beginning of historical criticism in France; and sceptical Dialogues published posthumously under the pseudonym of Orasius Tubero. An incomplete edition of his works was published at Dresden in 17561759.He was instrumental is popularizing Skepticism and Sextus Empiricus in particular whom he called the divine Sexte .

Molière was his close friend and it is rumored that much of the iconoclastic satire of his plays were inspired by Le Vayers erudite and savage criticism of religious hypocrisy - as expressed in the second version of his masterpiece Tartuffe which La Mothe Le Vayer defended in a caustic and anonymous Lettre sur la comédie de lImposteur against the religious faction at Louis XIVs court.Michel Foucault used this work as an important material in his famous essay Governmentality."
Bernard Lamy,"Bernard Lamy was a French Oratorian mathematician and theologian.

After studying in Le Mans he went to join the Maison dInstitution in Paris and to Saumur thereafter. In 1658 he entered the congregation of the Oratory.

Lamy became professor of classics at Vendôme in 1661 and at Juilly in 1663. He was ordained in 1667.

After teaching a few years at Le Mans he was appointed to a chair of philosophy in the University of Angers. Here his teaching was attacked on the ground that it was too exclusively Cartesian and Rebous the rector obtained in 1675 from the state authorities a decree forbidding him to continue his lectures.

He was then sent by his superiors to Grenoble where thanks to the protection of Cardinal Le Camus he again took up his courses of philosophy. In 1686 he returned to Paris stopping at the seminary of Saint Magloire and in 1689 he was sent to Rouen where he spent the remainder of his days.

His best known work is the Traité de Mécanique showing the parallelogram of force. He also wrote Traité de la grandeur en general and Les éléments de géometrie .

His writings are numerous and varied. Among them may be mentioned "
Pierre de la Place,"Duke Pierre de la Place was a French Huguenot martyr who died a few days after the 1572 St. Bartholomews Day Massacre of the Huguenots. According to Foxe he was informed of the massacre and ordered to report to the King to await the Kings pleasure. He fled but was unable to find shelter with any Catholics and eventually returned to his house and fortified himself in leading his wife and servants in prayer while he waited. He was eventually obliged to leave with the Kings men who led him into the clutches of assassins who killed him. His corpse was placed in a stable where it was desecrated with horse dung and his house was plundered.

Pierre de La Place was the cousin of French Protestant theologian Josué de la Place and the great-great-great-grandfather of eighteenth century writer and playwright Pierre-Antoine de La Place the first French translator of Shakespeare."
Jean Laplanche,"Jean Laplanche was a French author psychoanalyst and winemaker. Laplanche is best known for his work on psychosexual development and Sigmund Freuds seduction theory and wrote more than a dozen books on psychoanalytic theory. The journal Radical Philosophy described him as the most original and philosophically informed psychoanalytic theorist of his day.

From 1988 to his death Laplanche was the scientific director of the German to French translation of Freuds complete works in the Presses Universitaires de France in association with André Bourguignon Pierre Cotet and François Robert.

Laplanche grew up in the Côte dOr region of France. In his adolescence he was active in Catholic Action a left-wing social justice organization. Laplanche attended the École Normale Supérieure in the 1940s studying philosophy. He was a student of Jean Hyppolite Gaston Bachelard and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. In 1943 during the Vichy regime Laplanche joined the French Resistance and was active in Paris and Bourgogne. In 194647 he visited Harvard University for a year. Instead of joining that universitys philosophy department he instead studied at the Department of Social Relations and became interested in psychoanalytic theory. After returning to France Laplanche began attending lectures and undergoing psychoanalytic treatment under Jacques Lacan. Laplanche advised by Lacan began studying medicine and eventually earned his doctorate and became an analyst himself joining the International Psychoanalytical Association of which he remained a member until his death.

Laplanche continued his political activity. In 1948 Laplanche was one of the founding members of the organization Socialisme ou Barbarie after breaking with Trotskyism but notes that the groups atmosphere soon became impossible due to the influence of Cornelius Castoriadis who exerted hegemony over the journal. Nevertheless Laplanche remained in favour of the thesis of Socialisme ou Barbarie until 1968.

Laplanche for many years ran Chateau de Pommard a French vineyard together with his wife Nadine.Chateau de Pommard is a 50-acre winery in Burgundy and has the longest continuous vineyard in the Côte-dOr region. The Laplanches lived on the estate and made wine for a number of years. In 2003 the couple sold the estate to new owners. The deal included an agreement that the Laplanches would remain on the estate and continue for some time to participate in the winemaking process. Their wine has been advertised as the only wine in the world grown and bottled by an old disciple of Lacans.

Laplanche and his wife were interviewed about both wine and psychoanalysis in Agnès Vardas documentary The Gleaners and I.

Nadine Laplanche died in spring 2010. Jean Laplanche seemed to live exclusively in Pommard until his death two years later.

Jean Laplanche was one of the founders of the Association Psychanalytique de France and served also as its president in 19691971. He was later an honorary member of this Association with Jean-Bertrand Pontalis and Guy Rosolato.

Laplanche was granted honorary doctorates from the University of Lausanne the University of Buenos Aires and the University of Athens. He was the winner of the Mary S. Sigourney Award . Laplanche was also made a Knight of Arts and Letters in 1990.

Jean Laplanche was an Emeritus Professor of the University of Paris where he taught from 1970 until 1993 he introduced the teaching of psychoanalysis in the U.F.R. des Sciences Humaines Cliniques in Paris VII and brought it to the level of research. He supervised theses of students who are now teaching psychoanalysis in the university in France and elsewhere in the world .

Laplanche published his first book in 1961. The following year he was invited to a position at the Sorbonne by Daniel Lagache. Since then Laplanche maintained a regular publication schedule. Together with colleague Jean-Bertrand Pontalis Laplanche in 1967 published The Language of Psycho-Analysis which has become a standard encyclopedic reference on psychoanalysis. It was translated into English in 1973 and its thirteenth French edition was published in 1997. Laplanche was president of the Association Psychoanalytique de France from 1969 to 1971 being succeeded by Pontalis. His seminars have been published in the seven volume Problématiques series while many of his most important essays are found in La révolution copernicienne inachevée .

One of his major contributions to psychoanalysis consists of the théorie de la séduction généralisée . Of his work on Freuds seduction theory he said

Laplanche proposed a reformulation of Freuds seduction theory as a truly general theory of the origins of the repressed unconscious rather than a mere etiological hypothesis about neurotic symptoms. The goal of the theory was to account for the normal development of the unconscious in human beings while... it carries in its wake a theory of transference and of the psychoanalytic process in general.

Laplanche highlights enigmatic signifiers... transmitted via parental messages to the other as a key element in the creation of the unconscious in Laplanches words The enigma is in itself a seduction and its mechanisms are unconscious. Thus Laplanche makes the link in Freud between the intrusive impact of the adult Other on the one hand and the traumatic registration representation or inscription of the Others presence on the other.

Following the introduction of the theory of generalized seduction Laplanche published a collection of essays under the title The Unfinished Copernican Revolution which referred specifically to the object of psychoanalysis the unconscious the generalised seduction theory emphasising that such a revolution is incomplete.

Freud who repeatedly compared the psychoanalytic discovery to a Copernican revolution was for Laplanche both his own Copernicus but also his own Ptolemy. On the Copernican side there is the conjoint discovery of the unconscious and the seduction theory which maintains the sense of otherness; on the Ptolemaic side there is the misdirection of the Freudian return to a theory of self-centering. Thus what Laplanche calls Freuds going astray a disastrous shift from a Copernican to a Ptolemaic conception of the psyche... occurred when Freud replaced his early seduction theory... of sexuality as an alien-ness decentring the psyche with one centred upon the individual the illusion of a universe that Laplanche would characterize as Ptolemaic where the ego feels it occupies the central position.

The category of gender says Jean Laplanche is often absent or unnoticed in Freud. It is the child in the presence of adults which raises the question of this difference which exists in adults. Gender assignment is a complex process of acts which extends into the language and behavior of the childs significant others its entourage. The child is bombarded by prescriptive messages which it has to translate and make sense of messages of gender assignment all those provided by the adults close to the child parents grandparents brothers and sisters. Their fantasies their unconscious or preconscious expectations. Thus for Jean Laplanche Yes gender precedes sex. But instead of organizing it it is organized by the latter. It is primarily the sexual element in the parents which creates a fuss in gender-assignation because the infantile sexuality of the adults is reactivated in the presence of the child.

One key distinction between Laplanches approach to psychoanalysis and most of those in the English-speaking world Object relations theory Ego psychology and Kleinian thoughtis Laplanches insistence on a distinction between drive and instinct . In contrast to the English-speaking schools Laplanchein some ways following Lacanremoves a biologically reductive basis from human sexuality.

Since 2010 the translation in English of Jean Laplanches complete works has begun."
Pierre Laromiguière,"Pierre Laromiguière was a French philosopher.

He was born at Livinhac-le-Haut Rouergue and died in Paris. As professor of philosophy at the University of Toulouse he was unsuccessful and incurred the displeasure of the French parliament by his thesis on the rights of property in connection with taxation. Subsequently he came to Paris where he was appointed professor of logic in the École Normale and lectured in the Prytanée. In 1799 he was made a member of the Tribunate and in 1833 of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. In 1793 he published Projet déléments de métaphysique a work characterized by lucidity and excellence of style. He wrote also two Mémoires read before the Institute Les Paradoxes de Condillac and Le cours de philosophie .

Laromiguières philosophy is a revolt against the extreme physiological psychology of the natural scientists such as Cabanis. He distinguished between those psychological phenomena which can be traced directly to purely physical causes and the actions of the soul which originate from within itself. Psychology was not for him a branch of physiology nor on the other hand did he give to his theory an abstruse metaphysical basis. A pupil of Condillac and indebted for much of his ideology to Antoine Destutt de Tracy he attached a fuller importance to attention as a psychic faculty. Attention provides the facts Comparison groups and combines them while Reason systematizes and explains. The soul is active in its choice i.e. is endowed with freewill and is therefore immortal.

For natural science as a method of discovery he had no respect. He held that its judgments are at the best statements of identity and that its so-called discoveries are merely the reiteration in a new form of previous truisms. Laromiguière was not the first to develop these views; he owed much to Condillac Destutt de Tracy and Cabanis. The accuracy of his language and the purity of his style gave his works great influence especially over Armand Marrast Louis Cardaillac and Victor Cousin. A lecture of his in the École Normale impressed Cousin so strongly that he at once devoted himself to the study of philosophy. Jouffroy and Hippolyte Taine agree in describing him as one of the great thinkers of the 19th century."
François Laruelle,"François Laruelle ; born 22 August 1937 is a French philosopher formerly of the Collège international de philosophie and the University of Paris X Nanterre. Laruelle has been publishing since the early 1970s and now has around twenty book-length titles to his name. Alumnus of the École normale supérieure Laruelle is notable for developing a science of philosophy that he calls non-philosophy. He currently directs an international organisation dedicated to furthering the cause of non-philosophy the Organisation Non-Philosophique Internationale.

Laruelle divides his work into five periods Philosophy I Philosophy II Philosophy III Philosophy IV and Philosophy V . The work comprising Philosophy I finds Laruelle attempting to subvert concepts found in Nietzsche Heidegger Deleuze and Derrida. Even at this early stage one can identify Laruelles interest in adopting a transcendental stance towards philosophy. With Philosophy II Laruelle makes a determined effort to develop a transcendental approach to philosophy itself. However it is not until Philosophy III that Laruelle claims to have started the work of non-philosophy.

Laruelle claims that all forms of philosophy are structured around a prior decision but that all forms of philosophy remain constitutively blind to this decision. The decision that Laruelle is concerned with here is the dialectical splitting of the world in order to grasp the world philosophically. Laruelle claims that the decisional structure of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense non-philosophy is a science of philosophy. Laruellean ethics is radically de-anthropocentrized fundamentally directed towards a universalized auto-effective set of generic conditions.

A decade ago he was described by Scottish philosopher Ray Brassier as the most important unknown philosopher working in Europe today and was described by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari as engaged in one of the most interesting undertakings of contemporary philosophy. The first English-language reception of his work has been followed with a slew of introductions from John Ó Maoilearca Anthony Paul Smith Rocco Gangle Katerina Kolozova and Alexander R. Galloway as well as Brassiers own subsequent book Nihil Unbound. Today Laruelles international reception is growing with dozens of titles a year translated and published in English by such publishing houses as Polity Books Edinburgh University Press Continuum Palgrave Macmillan Columbia University Press UrbanomicSequence and others."
Bruno Latour,"Bruno Latour is a French philosopher anthropologist and sociologist. He is especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies . After teaching at the École des Mines de Paris from 1982 to 2006 he became Professor at Sciences Po Paris where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. He was also a Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics.

Latour is best known for his books We Have Never Been Modern Laboratory Life and Science in Action . Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with social constructionist approaches to the philosophy of science Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjectiveobjective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice. Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.Along with Michel Callon and John Law Latour is one of the primary developers of actornetwork theory a constructionist approach influenced by the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel the generative semiotics of Algirdas Julien Greimas and the sociology of Émile Durkheims rival Gabriel Tarde.

Latour is related to a well-known family of winemakers from Burgundy but is not associated with the similarly named estate in Bordeaux.

As a student Latour originally focused on philosophy. In 19711972 he ranked second and then first in the French national competitive exam . He was deeply influenced by Michel Serres.. Latour went on to earn his Ph.D. in philosophical theology in 1975 at the University of Tours. His thesis title was Exégèse et ontologie une analyse des textes de resurrection .

He developed an interest in anthropology and undertook fieldwork in Ivory Coast which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization race and industrial relations. After spending more than twenty years at the Centre de sociologie de linnovation at the École des Mines in Paris Latour moved in 2006 to Sciences Po where he was the first occupant of a chair named for Gabriel Tarde. In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie in Karlsruhe Germany including Iconoclash and Making Things Public . In 2005 he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam.

On 22 May 2008 Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Université de Montréal on the occasion of an organizational communication conference held in honor of the work of James R. Taylor on whom Latour has had an important influence. He holds several other honorary doctorates as well as Frances Légion dHonneur .The Dutch International Spinozaprijs Foundation will award the Spinozalens 2020 to Bruno Latour on 24 November 2020.In 2021 he received the Kyoto Prize in the category Thought and Ethics.

On 13 March 2013 he was announced as the winner of the 2013 Holberg Prize. The prize committee stated that Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern nature and society human and non-human. The committee states that the impact of Latours work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science art history history philosophy anthropology geography theology literature and law.

A 2013 article in Aftenposten by Jon Elster criticised the conferment to Latour by saying The question is does he deserve the prize. ... If the statutes had used new knowledge as a main criteria instead of one of several then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion.

After his early career efforts Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of Laboratory Life the Social Construction of Scientific Facts with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the scientific method in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that for untrained observers the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are socially constructed within the laboratorythat they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs oral traditions and culturally specific practicesin short science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latours 1987 book Science in Action How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.

Some of Latours position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latours position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts e.g. if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil Latours hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly philosopher John Searle argues that Latours extreme social constructivist position is seriously flawed on several points and furthermore has inadvertently comical results.

After a research project examining the sociology of primatologists Latour followed up the themes in Laboratory Life with Les Microbes guerre et paix . In it he reviews the life and career of one of Frances most famous scientists Louis Pasteur and his discovery of microbes in the fashion of a political biography. Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteurs career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted. By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteurs work more easily in some quarters than in others he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily or even usually a matter of experiment evidence or reason. 

Aramis or The Love of Technology focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project. Aramis PRT a high tech automated subway had been developed in France during the 70s and 80s and was supposed to be implemented as a Personal Rapid Transit system in Paris. It combined the flexibility of an automobile with the efficiency of a subway. Aramis was to be an ideal urban transportation system based on private cars in constant motion and the elimination of unnecessary transfers. This new form of transportation was intended to be as secure and inexpensive as collective transportation. The proposed system had custom-designed motors sensors controls digital electronics software and a major installation in southern Paris. But in the end the project died in 1987. Latour argues that the technology failed not because any particular actor killed it but because the actors failed to sustain it through negotiation and adaptation to a changing social situation. While investigating Aramiss demise Latour delineates the tenets of actor-network theory. According to Latours own description of the book the work aims at training readers in the booming field of technology studies and at experimenting in the many new literary forms that are necessary to handle mechanisms and automatisms without using the belief that they are mechanical nor automatic.

Latours work Nous navons jamais été modernes Essai danthropologie symétrique was first published in French in 1991 and then in English in 1993 as We Have Never Been Modern.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape. He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the scientific method to knowledge and work blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism over postmodernism modernism or antimodernism. His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives. Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake. He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit rationality liberty society God or even the past. Postmoderns according to Latour also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real. In contrast the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other. Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old objectsubject and NatureSociety compacts of modernity which can be traced back to Plato. He refused the concept of out there versus in here. He rendered the objectsubject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge work and circulating reference. Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field one vastly different than that of post-moderns. He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical a creation of an unknown territory which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.

In 1998 historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latours politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is a fanciful escape from modern Western history.

Pandoras Hope marks a return to the themes Latour explored in Science in Action and We Have Never Been Modern. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative anecdotal approach in a number of the essays describing his work with pedologists in the Amazon rainforest the development of the pasteurization process and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best that is paying close attention to the details of scientific practice . Some authors have criticized Latours methodology including Katherine Pandora a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of Pandoras Hope Katherine Pandora states

In addition to his epistemological concerns Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in Pandoras Hope. Two of the chapters draw on Platos Gorgias as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review

Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance global warming the spread of mad cow disease and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in Pandoras Hope. In Felix Stalders article Beyond constructivism towards a realistic realism he summarizes Latours position on the political dimension of science studies as follows These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them.

In a 2004 article Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career asking Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and more generally of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique as currently practiced is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget. To regain focus and credibility Latour argues that social critiques must embrace empiricism to insist on the cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude to speak like William James. 

Latour suggests that about 90 per cent of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms the fact position and the fairy position. The fairy position is anti-fetishist arguing that objects of belief are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the naive believer; the fact position argues that individuals are dominated often covertly and without their awareness by external forces . Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind asks Latour no matter which position you take Youre always right Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use an unrepentant positivist approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish. These inconsistencies and double standards go largely unrecognized in social critique because there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position. 

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential critical barbarity that haslike a malign virus created by a mad scientistthus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists including global warming deniers and the 911 Truth movement Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously but I am worried to detect in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief punctilious demands for proofs and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland many of the weapons of social critique. 

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya but the one for whom if something is constructed then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution.

Latours article has been highly influential within the field of postcritique an intellectual movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that seeks to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique critical theory and ideological criticism. The literary critic Rita Felski has named Latour as an important precursor to the project of postcritique.

In Reassembling the Social Latour continues a reappraisal of his work developing what he calls a practical metaphysics which calls real anything that an actor claims as a source of motivation for action. So if someone says I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors we are obliged to recognize the ontological weight of their claim rather than attempting to replace their belief in Gods presence with social stuff like class gender imperialism etc. Latours nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected their recalcitrance recognized their objections deployed their multiplicity accepted.

For Latour to talk about metaphysics or ontologywhat really ismeans paying close empirical attention to the various contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latours description of metaphysics

If we call metaphysics the discipline . . . that purports to define the basic structure of the world then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and as ceaselessly contest the existence of others. The question then becomes how to explore the actors own metaphysics.

A more traditional metaphysicist might object arguing that this means there are multiple contradictory realities since there are controversies over agencies since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action . This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latours nuance for Latour there is no basic structure of reality or a single self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities or worlds in his terms existsone for each actors sources of agency inspirations for action. Actors bring the real into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one basic structure that explains agency but to recognize the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors. Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to relativism Latour argues. The relativist researcher learns the actors language records what they say about what they do and does not appeal to a higher structure to explain the actors motivations. The relativist takes seriously what are obstinately saying and follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what makes them act. The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation."

Émile Lasbax,"Lasbax was born in the commune of Rieumes of southwestern France in 1888. He completed his doctoral thesis Le Problème du Mal and also the Academy of Political Sciences at Columbia University.

Lasbaxs original work can largely be characterized as a synthesis of metaphysics and sociology. He saw the spiritual and material life of collective society as thoroughly intertwined and asserted that history was developmental such that its final state would yield a truly human society.

Early on Lasbax was heavily influenced by the work of Théodore Ruyssen who was himself an interpreter of Henri Bergson. Nevertheless he drew from a wide variety of thinkers to develop his own original work. Such thinkers include Baruch Spinoza Johann Gottlieb Fichte Auguste Comte Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Emile Durkheim."

Louis Lavelle,"Louis Lavelle was a French philosopher considered one of the greatest French metaphysicians of the twentieth century. His magnum opus La Dialectique de léternel présent is a systematic metaphysical work. Lavelles other principal works include De lÊtre De lActe Du Temps et de lEternité and De lÂme Humaine .

In his works Lavelle dealt with themes such as axiology aesthetics the problem of evil morality and freedom of the spirit. Lavelle was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques.

Louis Lavelle was born in France in 1883 and died there in 1951. He was Professor at the College de France; at the Sorbonne; and lectured at German Italian Swiss Belgian and Dutch universities. In 1947 he was recognized for his many philosophical and religious writings and named to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

Lavelles work aroused much interest in the interwar period yet received less attention in the second half of the twentieth century. Although he was recognized by some of the greatest French philosophers of the 20th century such as Merleau-PontyGilles DeleuzePaul Ricœur and Pierre Hadot In addition to the coverage he received in France articles dedicated to him have come from Italian and Brazilian interpreters.

From 1989 to 2019 thank to efforts by names like Alexis Klimov Jean École Jean-Louis Vieillard-Baron Michel Adam and Bruno Pinchard the Louis Lavelle Association promoted annual conferences on the work of the author. While some 21st century commentators consider Lavelle a forgotten philosopher ongoing scholarship on his work continues into 2021. 

Lavelles other writings include La dialectique du monde sensible La perception visuelle de la profondeur La conscience de soi La présence totale LErreur de Narcisse Le Mal et la Souffrance La Parole et lÉcriture and Les puissances du Moi ."
Antoine Lavoisier,"Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.It is generally accepted that Lavoisiers great accomplishments in chemistry stem largely from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He recognized and named oxygen and hydrogen and opposed the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system wrote the first extensive list of elements and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon and discovered that although matter may change its form or shape its mass always remains the same.

Lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils and an administrator of the Ferme générale. The Ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the Ancien Régime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state the secrecy of the terms of its contracts and the violence of its armed agents. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the French Revolution he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco and was guillotined.

Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parlement of Paris he inherited a large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother. Lavoisier began his schooling at the Collège des Quatre-Nations University of Paris in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years at the school his scientific interests were aroused and he studied chemistry botany astronomy and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law where he received a bachelors degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar but never practiced as a lawyer. However he continued his scientific education in his spare time.

Lavoisiers education was filled with the ideals of the French Enlightenment of the time and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquers dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisiers devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by Étienne Condillac a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767 he studied geology under Jean-Étienne Guettard. In collaboration with Guettard Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the French Academy of Sciences Frances most elite scientific society on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban street lighting. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences. In 1769 he worked on the first geological map of France.

While Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public. Lavoisier was a humanitarianhe cared deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture industry and the sciences. The first instance of this occurred in 1765 when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.

Three years later in 1768 he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water. But since the construction never commenced he instead turned his focus to purifying the water from the Seine. This was the project that interested Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.

Additionally he was interested in air quality and spent some time studying the health risks associated with gunpowders effect on the air. In 1772 he performed a study on how to reconstruct the Hôtel-Dieu hospital after it had been damaged by fire in a way that would allow proper ventilation and clean air throughout.

At the time the prisons in Paris were known to be largely unlivable and the prisoners treatment inhumane. Lavoisier took part in investigations in 1780 on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions suggestions which were largely ignored.

Once a part of the Academy Lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work. One such project he proposed in 1793 was to better public health on the insalubrious arts.

Lavoisier had a vision of public education having roots in scientific sociability and philanthropy.

Lavoisier gained a vast majority of his income through buying stock in the General Farm which allowed him to work on science full-time live comfortably and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community. 

It was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist so Lavoisier used his wealth to open a very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in France so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research.

He also pushed for public education in the sciences. He founded two organizations Lycée and Musée des Arts et Métiers which were created to serve as educational tools for the public. Funded by the wealthy and noble the Lycée regularly taught courses to the public beginning in 1793.

At the age of 26 around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences Lavoisier bought a share in the Ferme générale a tax farming financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme générale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a wall around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city. His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the Reign of Terror began in France as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution.

Lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when in 1771 at age 28 he married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the Ferme générale. She was to play an important part in Lavoisiers scientific careernotably she translated English documents for him including Richard Kirwans Essay on Phlogiston and Joseph Priestleys research. In addition she assisted him in the laboratory and created many sketches and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works. Madame Lavoisier edited and published Antoines memoirs and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.

A portrait of Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier was painted by the famed artist Jacques-Louis David. Completed in 1788 on the eve of the Revolution the painting was denied a customary public display at the Paris Salon for fear that it might inflame anti-aristocratic passions.

For three years following his entry into the Ferme générale Lavoisiers scientific activity diminished somewhat for much of his time was taken up with official Ferme générale business. He did however present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the earthy sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French monetary and taxation system to help the peasants.

The Farmers General held a monopoly of the production import and sale of tobacco in France and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. This revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco When a spirit of vitriol aqua fortis or some other acid solution is poured on ash there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction accompanied by an easily detected noise. Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated. Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added as he recommended a consistent 6.3 of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added and to exclude the black market Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks accounts supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.

Lavoisier urged the establishment of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.

Lavoisiers researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties especially in connection with the Ferme Générale. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier whose organizing skills were outstanding frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company similar to the Ferme Générale which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts both the quantity and quality of French gunpowder greatly improved and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisiers scientific career as well. As a commissioner he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.

Lavoisier was a formative influence in the formation of the Du Pont gunpowder business because he trained Éleuthère Irénée du Pont its founder on gunpowder-making in France; the latter said that the Du Pont gunpowder mills would never have been started but for his kindness to me.

In June 1791 Lavoisier made a loan of 71000 livres to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish a newspaper La Correspondance Patriotique. The plan was for this to include both reports of debates in the National Constituent Assembly as well as papers from the Academy of Sciences. The revolution quickly disrupted the elder du Ponts first newspaper but his son E.I. du Pont soon launched Le Republicain and published Lavoisiers latest chemistry texts.

Lavoisier also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures which in March 1791 recommended the adoption of the metric system. The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the Convention on 1 August 1793. Lavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793 together with mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and several other members for political reasons.

One of his last major works was a proposal to the National Convention for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange helping to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.

As the French Revolution gained momentum attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular Ferme générale and it was eventually abolished in March 1791. In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793 all the learned societies including the Academy of Sciences were suppressed at the request of Abbé Grégoire.

On 24 November 1793 the arrest of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defense refuting the financial accusations reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court was however inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing their goods it would recover huge sums for the state. Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris at the age of 50 along with his 27 co-defendants.

According to popular legend the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge Coffinhal La République na pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu. The judge Coffinhal himself would be executed less than three months later in the wake of the Thermidorian reaction. 

Lavoisiers importance to science was expressed by Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying Il ne leur a fallu quun moment pour faire tomber cette tête et cent années peut-être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable. 

A year and a half after his execution Lavoisier was completely exonerated by the French government. During the White Terror his belongings were delivered to his widow. A brief note was included reading To the widow of Lavoisier who was falsely convicted.

About a century after his death a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisiers head for the statue but used a spare head of the Marquis de Condorcet the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisiers last years. Lack of money prevented alterations from being made. The statue was melted down during the Second World War and has not been replaced. One of the main lycées in Paris and a street in the 8th arrondissement are named after Lavoisier and statues of him are found on the Hôtel de Ville and on the façade of the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre. His name is one of the 72 names of eminent French scientists engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the Eiffel Tower as well as on buildings around Killian Court at MIT in Cambridge MA.

During late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of combustion the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October in which he reported that when phosphorus burned it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause.

During 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air particularly fixed air and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled Opuscules physiques et chimiques . In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of Joseph Black the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali for example chalk and the caustic form for example quicklime lay in the fact that the former contained fixed air not common air fixed in the chalk but a distinct chemical species now understood to be carbon dioxide which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Blacks fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Blacks fixed air that is CO2.

In the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels the results of which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was in combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist Joseph Priestley visited Paris where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the red calx of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own research on this peculiar substance. The result was his memoir On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 . In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with charcoal giving off Blacks fixed air in the process. When reduced without charcoal it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself undivided without alteration without decomposition which combined with metals on calcination.

After returning from Paris Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration inflammation and ... every other use of common air. He called the air dephlogisticated air as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.

Lavoisiers researches included some of the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. In 1774 he showed that although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus for instance if a piece of wood is burned to ashes the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisiers experiments supported the law of conservation of mass. In France it is taught as Lavoisiers Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his Traité Élémentaire de Chimie Nothing is lost nothing is created everything is transformed. Mikhail Lomonosov had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey Joseph Black and Henry Cavendish .

Lavoisier together with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau Claude-Louis Berthollet and Antoine François de Fourcroy submitted a new program for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787 for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work titled Méthode de nomenclature chimique introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisiers new oxygen theory of chemistry. The Classical elements of earth air fire and water were discarded and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric ; the principles of oxygen hydrogen and azote ; carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown radicals of muriatic acid boric acid and fluoric acid; 17 metals; 5 earths ; three alkalies ; and the radicals of 19 organic acids. The acids regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids phosphoric and phosphorous acids nitric and nitrous acids the ic termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the ous ending. Similarly salts of the ic acids were given the terminal letters ate as in copper sulfate whereas the salts of the ous acids terminated with the suffix ite as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name copper sulfate with the old term vitriol of Venus. Lavoisiers new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.

Lavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the widespread acceptance of the law of conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology a binomial system modeled after that of Linnaeus also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley Richard Kirwan James Keir and William Nicholson among others argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass. Rather than reporting factual evidence opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisiers allies Jean Baptiste Biot wrote of Lavoisiers methodology one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning. His opposition argued that precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasoning. Despite opposition Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful stated 

If it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures I must beg leave to observe that these long rows of figures which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of and more than this that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the exactitude scrupuleuse of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs de lordre demonstratif.

The official version of Lavoisiers Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestleys latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestleys dephlogisticated air he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778 Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air or the eminently respirable part of the air. The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air from the Greek words meaning acid former. He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur phosphorus charcoal and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.

Lavoisiers chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his paper entitled Réflexions sur le phlogistique a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendishs inflammable air which Lavoisier termed hydrogen with dephlogisticated air by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted Cavendishs production of pure water by burning hydrogen in oxygen but they interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of phlogiston theory. Lavoisier learned of Cavendishs experiment in June 1783 via Charles Blagden and immediately recognized water as the oxide of a hydroelectric gas.

In cooperation with Laplace Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element as had been thought for over 2000 years but a compound of two gases hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids and the reduction of calces by inflammable air .

Despite these experiments Lavoisiers antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with Jean-Baptiste Meusnier Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Académie des Sciences in April 1784 reporting his figures to eight decimal places. Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which utilized a pneumatic trough a set of balances a thermometer and a barometer all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisiers theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment however proved subpar as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries.

Lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his Traité élémentaire de chimie published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisiers contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry contained a clear statement of the law of conservation of mass and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented Lavoisiers theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisiers new ideas demand for Traité élémentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication. In any event the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.

The relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged therefore to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of respiration physiology. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777 but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 17821783 in association with Laplace. The result of this work was published in a memoir On Heat. Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice calorimeter apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow which melted to maintain a constant temperature of 0 C around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of carbon dioxide and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated la respiration est donc une combustion that is respiratory gas exchange is a combustion like that of a candle burning.

This continuous slow combustion which they supposed took place in the lungs enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 17891790 in cooperation with Armand Seguin. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body metabolism and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisiers pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come.

Lavoisiers fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids .

Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.

Lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory believing that radicals which function as a single group in a chemical process combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a crystalline form of carbon.

He was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these he also created smaller cheaper more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.

He was essentially a theorist and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried outwithout always adequately recognizing their claimsand by a rigorous logical procedure reinforced by his own quantitative experiments expounding the true explanation of the results. He completed the work of Black Priestley and Cavendish and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.

Overall his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.

During his lifetime Lavoisier was awarded a gold medal by the King of France for his work on urban street lighting and was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences . He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1775.

Lavoisiers work was recognized as an International Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society Académie des sciences de Linstitut de France and the Société Chimique de France in 1999. Antoine Laurent Lavoisiers Louis 1788 publication entitled Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique published with colleagues Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau Claude Louis Berthollet and Antoine François comte de Fourcroy was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented at the Académie des Sciences in 2015.

A number of Lavoisier Medals have been named and given in Lavoisiers honour by organizations including the Société chimique de France the International Society for Biological Calorimetry and the DuPont company He is also commemorated by the Franklin-Lavoisier Prize marking the friendship of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin. The prize which includes a medal is given jointly by the Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie in Paris France and the Science History Institute in Philadelphia PA USA."
Maurizio Lazzarato,"Maurizio Lazzarato is an Italian sociologist and philosopher residing in Paris France. In the 1970s he was an activist in the workers movement in Italy. Lazzarato was a founding member of the editorial board of the journal Multitudes. He is a researcher at MatisseCNRS Pantheon-Sorbonne University and a member of the International College of Philosophy in Paris.

Lazzarato studied at the University of Padua in the 1970s where he was active in the Autonomia Operaia movement. He left Italy in the late 1970s for exile in France to escape political prosecution although the charges against him were abandoned in the 1990s.

Lazzarato is known for his essay Immaterial Labor that appeared in a collection of contemporary Italian political theory edited by Marxist philosophers Michael Hardt and Paolo Virno called Radical Thought in Italy . His research focuses on immaterial labor the transformation of wage labor and work and cognitive capitalism. He is also interested in the concepts of biopolitics and bioeconomics.

Lazzarato has written two closely related works on the subject of debt The Making of the Indebted Man and Governing by Debt. Both books were translated into English and published as part of the Semiotext Intervention Series. In both works Lazzarato uses continental philosophy and economic data to critique debt and neoliberalism from a left-wing perspective.

In The Making of the Indebted Man Lazzarato examines debt as it is experienced by individuals specifically the subject; he also presents a case that the debtor-creditor relationship is a central category of economicsmore important than money or finance for example. In the modern economy it is taken for granted that debts must be repaid and much of economic activity is driven by lending with the expectation of future repayment. Lazzarato observes that in order for such an economy to function its actors must first be socialized to accept the premise that debts must be repaid. This entails that they become capable of making promises and of feeling guilt . To illustrate this process he refers to the second treatise of Nietzsches Genealogy of Morality which deals with the concepts of guilt debt and socialization.

What is creditdebt in its most elementary sense A promise of payment. What is a financial asset a share or bond The promise of future value. Promise value and future are also key words in Nietzsches Second Essay. For Nietzsche the oldest and most personal relationship there is is that between creditor and debtor a relationship wherein person met person for the first time and measured himself person against person. Consequently the task of a community or society has first of all been to engender a person capable of promising someone able to stand guarantor for himself in the creditor-debtor relationship that is capable of honoring his debt. Making a person capable of keeping a promise means constructing a memory for him endowing him with interiority a conscience which provide a bulwark against forgetting. It is within the domain of debt obligations that memory subjectivity and conscience begin to be produced.

Lazzarato refers to the socializing process of creating individual subjects as subjectivation. He also contrasts the Nietzschean view of creditdebt with those given by Marx and by Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus. The latter part of the book is a criticism of debt as used in European neoliberal governance introducing ideas which are developed more fully in Governing by Debt.

The Making of the Indebted Man has proved crucial for the application of the theorizing of neoliberal debt in relation to material culture and contemporary art.

In Governing by Debt Lazzarato uses the vocabulary developed in Making of the Indebted Man to examine how debt is employed by states and private enterprise as opposed to individuals. The book is a critique of neoliberalism and governmentality where the latter refers to a form of government which responds to economic demands a notion closely related to ordoliberalism. Lazzarato characterizes American student debt as an ideal example of the creditdebt economy and also uses history and anthropology to trace a cultural notion of infinite debt which he argues has informed the modern economy.

The books central idea is that basic categories of the economic and political spheres are in fact not distinct but closely related and overlapping. For example governments and businesses closely coordinate their policies laws business practices and expectations and are therefore coupled with each other. Lazzarato cites the work of Carl Schmitt to illustrate the point. Lazzarato also cites Foucaults work The Birth of Biopolitics to illustrate the social experience of debt; however he criticizes the distinction that Foucault makes between states and economies with classical liberalism as a mediator. Further the distinction between industrial capitalism and financial capitalism is questioned; however Lazzarato retains the distinction in the sense that financial capitalism is the purest form of capitalism because it simply transforms one form of money into another form of money through valorization without using a commodity as an intermediate step. In Marxist terminology this is expressed as M-M as opposed to M-C-M . Lazzarato also cites Lenins work Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism to indicate the primacy of financial capitalism emergent during Lenins period.

Lazzarato concludes the text by proposing refusal of work as a technique for the disruption of the modern economy. He advocates for this goal because he attributes responsibility for human suffering during financial crises to capitalists and state actors and not to any national population. However national populations are nevertheless made to pay for such crises and socialized to feel responsibility for them through taxation austerity and media messaging

The state technocratic governments and the media invest considerable energy to ensure a populations guilt for a debt into which it has never entered and therefore its responsibility for faults it has never committed. The laws speeches articles and slogans deployed to this end are directly proportional to the scope of the fraud. During the crisis technocratic governments have moved to construct a memory of debt not for individuals but for entire nations. The violence of taxes and appropriations is the privileged instrument for only that which inflicts pain is engraved in memory only that which hurts registers and remains inscribed in consciousness ."
Pierre Lecomte du Noüy,"Pierre Lecomte du Noüy was a French biophysicist and philosopher. He is probably best remembered by scientists for his work on the surface tension and other properties of liquids.

Du Noüy was a descendant of the French dramatist Pierre Corneille. His mother wrote many novels one of which Amitié Amoureuse was translated into 16 languages and ran for 600 editions in France. Born and educated in France du Noüy obtained the degrees of LL.B. Ph.B. Sc.B. Ph.D. and Sc.D.

He was an associate member of the Rockefeller Institute working in Alexis Carrels lab from 1920 through 1928 head for 10 years of the biophysics division of the Pasteur Institute and the author of some 200 published papers.

He invented the Tensiometer a scientific apparatus that used his du Noüy ring method to measure the surface tension of liquids.

Du Noüy believed that mankind should have confidence in science but be aware that we know less about the material world than is commonly believed.

The following information is taken from one of his books

Du Noüy converted from agnosticism to Christianity. He supported a theistic and teleological interpretation of evolution. In his book Human Destiny he wrote that biological evolution continues to a spiritual and moral plane. Du Noüy met Pierre Teilhard de Chardin who shared similar interests in evolution and spirituality.

Du Noüy developed his own hypothesis of orthogenesis known as telefinalism. According to Du Noüy evolution could not occur by chance alone and that on an average since the beginning of the world it has followed an ascending path always oriented in the same direction. He accepted naturalistic evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation and natural selection but believed science could not explain all evolutionary phenomena or the origin of life. According to his telefinalist hypothesis a transcendent cause which he equated with God is directing the evolutionary process.

His telefinalist hypothesis was criticized by Carl HempelLeo Koch and George Gaylord Simpson as nonscientific.

If telefinalism by postulating the intervention of an Idea a Will a supreme Intelligence throws a little light on the combined transformations leading through an uninterrupted line to Man it seems impossible not to see in the particular transformations limited to the species something more than the simple play of physico-chemical forces and chance.

Henri Lefebvre,"Henri Lefebvre was a French Marxist philosopher and sociologist best known for pioneering the critique of everyday life for introducing the concepts of the right to the city and the production of social space and for his work on dialectical materialism alienation and criticism of Stalinism existentialism and structuralism. In his prolific career Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles. He founded or took part in the founding of several intellectual and academic journals such as Philosophies La Revue Marxiste Arguments Socialisme ou Barbarie Espaces et Sociétés.

Lefebvre was born in Hagetmau Landes France. He studied philosophy at the University of Paris graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with Paul Nizan Norbert Guterman Georges Friedmann Georges Politzer and Pierre Morhange in the Philosophies group seeking a philosophical revolution. This brought them into contact with the Surrealists Dadaists and other groups before they moved towards the French Communist Party .

Lefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century before joining the French resistance. From 1944 to 1949 he was the director of Radiodiffusion Française a French radio broadcaster in Toulouse. Among his works was a highly influential anti-Stalinist text on dialectics called Dialectical Materialism . Seven years later Lefebvre published his first volume of The Critique of Everyday Life. His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in Critique of Dialectical Reason . During Lefebvres thirty-year stint with the PCF he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvres former colleague Nizan only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. He then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of Frances most important critics of the PCFs politics and intellectual thought .

In 1961 Lefebvre became professor of sociology at the University of Strasbourg before joining the faculty at the new university at Nanterre in 1965. He was one of the most respected professors and he had influenced and analysed the May 1968 student revolt. Lefebvre introduced the concept of the right to the city in his 1968 book Le Droit à la ville . Following the publication of this book Lefebvre wrote several influential works on cities urbanism and space including The Production of Space which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of urban theory. By the 1970s Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of post-structuralists especially Michel Foucault. During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of Arguments a New Left magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.

Lefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary Radical Philosophy magazine honored his long and complex career and influence

One of Lefebvres most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the critique of everyday life which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of illusion and truth power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse specific rhythms the bodys polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms physiological rhythms and social rhythms . The everyday was in short the space in which all life occurred and between which all fragmented activities took place. It was the residual. While the theme presented itself in many works it was most notably outlined in his eponymous three-volume study which came out in individual installments decades apart in 1947 1961 and 1981.

Lefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production and moreover that in the mid 20th century capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonizedturned into a zone of sheer consumption. In this zone of everydayness shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure could lead to people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human liferather than abstract control of productive forcesthat humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.

Lefebvres work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory particularly for the Situationists as well as in politics . The third volume has also recently influenced scholars writing about digital technology and information in the present day since it has a section dealing with this topic at length including analysis of the Nora-Minc Report ; key aspects of information theory; and other general discussion of the colonisation of everyday life through information communication technologies as devices or services.

Lefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book The Survival of Capitalism written as a sort of prelude to La Production de lespace . These works have deeply influenced current urban theory mainly within human geography as seen in the current work of authors such as David Harvey Dolores Hayden and Edward Soja and in the contemporary discussions around the notion of spatial justice. Lefebvre is widely recognized as a Marxist thinker who was responsible for widening considerably the scope of Marxist theory embracing everyday life and the contemporary meanings and implications of the ever-expanding reach of the urban in the western world throughout the 20th century. The generalization of industry and its relation to cities The Right to the City and The Urban Revolution were all themes of Lefebvres writings in the late 1960s which was concerned among other aspects with the deep transformation of the city into the urban which culminated in its omnipresence .

Lefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space from natural space to more complex spaces and flows whose meaning is produced in a social way . Lefebvre analyzes each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions representations or theories of space and the spatial imaginary of the time .

Lefebvres argument in The Production of Space is that space is a social product or a complex social construction which affects spatial practices and perceptions. This argument implies the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practices; and the focus on the contradictory conflictual and ultimately political character of the processes of production of space. As a Marxist theorist Lefebvre argues that this social production of urban space is fundamental to the reproduction of society hence of capitalism itself. The social production of space is commanded by a hegemonic class as a tool to reproduce its dominance .

Lefebvre argued that every societyand therefore every mode of productionproduces a certain space its own space. The city of the ancient world cannot be understood as a simple agglomeration of people and things in spaceit had its own spatial practice making its own space . Then if every society produces its own space any social existence aspiring to be or declaring itself to be real but not producing its own space would be a strange entity a very peculiar abstraction incapable of escaping the ideological or even cultural spheres. Based on this argument Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners on the basis that they failed to produce a socialist space having just reproduced the modernist model of urban design and applied it onto that context

Change life Change Society These ideas lose completely their meaning without producing an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from soviet constructivists from the 1920s and 30s and of their failure is that new social relations demand a new space and vice-versa.

In his book The Urban Question Manuel Castells criticizes Lefebvres Marxist humanism and approach to the city influenced by Hegel and Nietzsche. Castells political criticisms of Lefebvres approach to Marxism echoed the structuralist Scientific Marxism school of Louis Althusser of which Lefebvre was an immediate critic. Many responses to Castells are provided in The Survival of Capitalism and some such as Andy Merrifield argue that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvres effort in writing the long and theoretically dense The Production of Space.

In Actually-Existing Success Economics Aesthetics and the Specificity of Socialist Urbanism Michal Murawski critiques Lefebvres dismissal of actually existing socialism by showing how socialist states produced differential space."
Claude Lefort,"Claude Lefort was a French philosopher and activist.

He was politically active by 1942 under the influence of his tutor the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty . By 1943 he was organising a faction of the Trotskyist Parti Communiste Internationaliste at the Lycée Henri-IV in Paris.

Lefort was impressed by Cornelius Castoriadis when he first met him. From 1946 he collaborated with him in the ChaulieuMontal Tendency so called from their pseudonyms Pierre Chaulieu and Claude Montal . They published On the Regime and Against the Defence of the USSR a critique of both the Soviet Union and its Trotskyist supporters. They suggested that the USSR was dominated by a social layer of bureaucrats and that it consisted of a new kind of society as aggressive as Western European societies. By 1948 having tried to persuade other Trotskyists of their viewpoint they broke away with about a dozen others and founded the libertarian socialist group Socialisme ou Barbarie. Leforts text LExpérience prolétarienne was important in shifting the groups focus towards forms of self-organisation.

For a time Lefort wrote for both the journal Socialisme ou Barbarie and for Les Temps Modernes. His involvement in the latter journal ended after a published debate during 19524 over Jean-Paul Sartres article The Communists and Peace. Lefort was for a long time uncomfortable with Socialisme ou Barbaries organisationalist tendencies. In 1958 he Henri Simon and others left Socialisme ou Barbarie and formed the group Informations et Liaison Ouvrières .

In his academic career Lefort taught at the University of São Paulo at the Sorbonne and at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales being affiliated to the Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron. He has written on the early political writers Niccolò Machiavelli and Étienne de La Boétie and explored the Totalitarian enterprise in its denial of social division... of the difference between the order of power the order of law and the order of knowledge.

Lefort studied at the Sorbonne. He became a Marxist in his youth under the influence of his teacher Maurice Merleau-Ponty. From 1944 he belonged to the small French Trotskyite. In 1946 he met Cornelius Castoriadis who came to Paris from Greece. Right away they formed a faction in the Trotskyist Parti Communiste Internationaliste called ChaulieuMontal Tendency that left the party and became the Socialism or Barbarism group and which in 1949 started a journal with this name.

Socialism or Barbarism considered the USSR to be an example of state capitalism and gave its support to anti-bureaucratic revolts in Eastern Europe especially the uprising in Budapest in 1956. Differences of opinion brought about a schism within Socialism or Barbarism and Lefort sided with Henri Simon one of the founders of the group Informations et Liaison Ouvrières later renamed Informations et Correspondance Ouvrieres in 1958. That year he abandoned the idea and ideology of political revolution and ceased his militant activism.

After having worked amongst other places in 1947 and 1948 for UNESCO in 1949 Lefort passed the aggregation in philosophy he taught at the high school in Nîmes and in Reims . In 1951 he was recruited as a sociology assistant at the Sorbonne by Georges Gurvitch. In the year 1952 he was detached from the sociology section of the CNRS until 1966 with a break of two years when he was professor of philosophy at University of São Paulo . As for the CNRS the support of Raymond Aron led to his recruitment as a teacher of sociology at the University of Caen where he worked from 1966 to 1971 the year when he defended as his doctoral thesis his book on Machiavelli The Labour of Work. That same year he was again hired as a researcher in the sociology section of the CNRS until 1976 when he joined the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales where he stayed until his retirement in 1989.

The intellectual work of Lefort is strongly tied to his participation often tension filled in successive journals. With Les Temps Modernes introduced by Merleau-Ponty he took part in the gatherings of collaborators and wrote from 1945 until his debate with J. P. Sartre in 1953. In Socialism or Barbarism he was active until 1950 then from 1955 to 1958. He was involved in Textures from 1971 to the end and there he brought in Castoriadis and Miguel Abensour. With them he created Libre in 1977 which was published up until 1980 when there were some disagreements with Castoriadis as well as with Gauchet. From 1982 to 1984 he led Passé-Present where amongst others Miguel Abensour Carlos Semprún Maura and Pierre Pachet participated. These last two as well as Claude Habib formed the reading committee of the Littérature et Politique that Lefort founded for the publisher Éditions Belin in 1987.

No doubt he assigned less importance to the research centers at which he had participated in EHESS the CECMAS founded by Georges Friedmann and which welcomed Edgar Morin then the Centre Aron which he frequented just before his death.

When Merleau-Ponty died in 1961 Lefort took charge of the publication of his manuscripts. In the 1970s he developed an analysis of bureaucratic regimes of Eastern Europe. He read The Gulag Archipelago and published a book on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. His main ideas on Stalinist totalitarianism were published in 1981 in a collection titled LInvention démocratique.

Lefort was part of the political theorists who put forward the relevance of a notion of totalitarianism which was relevant to Stalinism as well as fascism and considered totalitarianism as different in its essence from the big categories used in the western world since ancient Greece like the notions of dictatorship or tyranny. However contrary to the authors like Hannah Arendt who limited the notion to Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union between 1936 and 1953 Lefort applied it to the regimes of Eastern Europe in the second half of the century that is to an era when terror a central element of totalitarianism for the other authors had lost its most extreme dimensions.

It is in the study of these regimes and the reading of The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn where he developed his analysis of totalitarianism.

Lefort characterizes the totalitarian system by a double fence Totalitarianism abolishes the separation between state and society the political power permeates society and all preexisting human relations class solidarity professional or religious cooperations tend to be replaced with a one-dimensional hierarchy between those who order and those who obey. This is made possible especially through the association between state and the party hierarchy which is always very close so that the party hierarchy becomes the effective power. Lefort like other theorists thus identifies the destruction of public space and its fusion with the political power as a key element of totalitarianism.

Totalitarianism denies what Lefort calls the principle of internal divisions of society and its conception of society is marked by the affirmation of the totality. Every organization association or profession is thus subordinated to the planning of the state. The differences of opinion one of the values of democracy is abolished so that the entire social body is directed towards the same goal; even personal tastes become politicized and must be standardized. The aim of totalitarianism is to create a united and a closed society in which the components are not individuals and which is defined completely by the same goals the same opinions and the same practices. Stalinism thus knew the identification of the people to the proletariat of the proletariat to the party of the party to the management of the management to the Égocrate.

Lefort demonstrates the central difference between totalitarianism and dictatorship a dictatorship can admit competing transcendental principles like religion; the ideology of the totalitarian party is religion. A dictatorship does not aim for the destruction and absorption of society and a dictatorial power is a power of the state against society that presupposes the distinction of the two; the plan of a totalitarian party is to merge state with society in a closed united and uniform system subordinated under the fulfilment of a plan socialism in the case of the USSR. Lefort calls this system people-one The process of identification of power and society the process of homogenisation of the social space the process of the closing up of society and the authority to enchain it in order to constitute the totalitarian system.

The totalitarian system unified and organized presents itself like a body the social body dictatorship bureaucracy and apparatus need a new system of bodies. Lefort returns to the theories of Ernst Kantorowicz on the two bodies of the king in which the person of the totalitarian leader besides his physical and mortal body is a political body representing the one-people. In order to ensure its proper functioning and to maintain its unity the totalitarian system requires an Other the evil other a representation of the exterior the enemy against which the party combats the representative of the forces of the old society the emissary of the stranger of the imperialistic world.

The division between the interior and the exterior between the One-people and the Other is the only division that totalitarianism tolerates since it is founded upon this division. Lefort insists on the fact that the constitution of the One-people necessitates the incessant production of enemies and also speaks of their invention. For example Stalin prepared to attack the Jews of USSR when he died i.e. designing a new enemy and in the same way Mussolini had declared that bourgeois would be eliminated in Italy after World War II.

The relation between the one-people and the Other is a prophylactic command the enemy is a parasite to eliminate a waste. This exceeds the simple rhetorical effect that was commonly used in the contemporary political discourse yet in an underlying way it is part of the metaphorical vision of the totalitarian society as a body. This vision explained how the existence both of enemies of the state and their presence in the bosom of the population were seen as an illness. The violence roused against them was in this organicist metaphor a fever a symptom of the fight of the social body against the illness in the sense that the campaign against the enemy is feverish the fever is good its the sign in the society of the evil to counteract.

The situation of the totalitarian leader within this system is paradoxical and uncertain for he is at the same time a part of the system its head who commands the rest and the representation of the system everything. He is therefore the incarnation of the one-power i.e. the power executed in all parts of the one-people.

Lefort didnt consider totalitarianism as a situation almost as an ideal type which could potentially be realized through terror and extermination. He rather sees in it a set of processes which have endings that cannot be known thus their success cannot be determined. If the will of the totalitarian party to realize the perfect unity of the social body controls the magnitude of its action it also implies that the goal is impossible to achieve because its development necessarily leads to contradictions and oppositions. Totalitarianism is a regime with a prevailing sense of being gnawed away by the absurdity of its own ambition and the active or passive resistance of those subjected to it summarised the political scientist Dominique Colas.

Claude Lefort formulates his conception of democracy by mirroring his conception of totalitarism developing it in the same way by analyzing regimes of Eastern Europe and USSR. For Lefort democracy is the system characterized by the institutionalization of conflict within society the division of social body; it recognizes and even considers legitimate the existence of divergent interests conflicting opinions visions of the world that are opposed and even incompatible. Leforts vision makes the disappearance of the leader as a political body the putting to death of the king as Kantorowicz calls it the founding moment of democracy because it makes the seat of power hitherto occupied by an eternal substance transcending the mere physical existence of monarchs into an empty space where groups with shared interests and opinions can succeed each other but only for a time and at the will of elections. Power is no longer tied to any specific programme goal or proposal; it is nothing but a collection of instruments put temporarily at the disposal of those who win a majority. In Leforts invented and inventive democracy writes Dominique Colas power comes from the people and belongs to no one.

Democracy is thus a regime marked by its vagueness its incompleteness against which totalitarianism establishes itself. This leads Lefort to regard as democratic every form of opposition and protest against totalitarianism. The opposition and protest creates in a way a democratic space within the totalitarian system. Democracy is innovation the start of new movements the designation of new issues in the struggle against oppression it is a creative power capable of weakening even slaying the totalitarian Leviathan. A Leviathan whose paradoxical frailty Lefort emphasises.

The separation of civil society from the state which characterizes modern democracy is made possible by the disembodiment of society. A democratic country can also experience this inventive character when any group of citizens with a legitimate struggle may seek to establish new rights or defend its interests.

Lefort does not reject representative democracy but does not limit democracy to it. For instance he includes the social movements in the sphere of legitimate political debate."
Antoine Le Grand,"Antoine Le Grand was a French Recollect and Cartesian philosopher.

Born in Douai Spanish Netherlands he was attached at an early age to the English community of St. Bonaventures convent there and became a Franciscan Recollect friar and taught philosophy and divinity. Sent on the English mission he resided for many years in Oxfordshire and in 1695 he was tutor in the family of Henry Fermor of Tusmore. His advocacy of Cartesianism met with strong resistance from Samuel Parker who would become bishop of Oxford. Towards the close of his life he engaged in sharp controversies on metaphysical topics with John Sergeant a secular priest. At the twenty-third chapter of his order assembled in London on 9 July 1693 he was elected provincial and he held that office till his death on 9 August 1699.

He lived a studious and retired life. He is noted for the effort he made to render the approach of Descartes more apparently scholastic to improve its reception with traditionalists."
Xavier Léon,"Xavier Léon was a French-Jewish philosopher and historian of philosophy.

In 1893 Léon together with Élie Halévy and others helped found the French philosophical journal Revue de métaphysique et de morale. Léon remained editor of the journal until his death in 1935 when he was succeeded by Dominique Parodi. In 1900 he founded the International Congress of Philosophy and in 1901 the Société Française de Philosophie. He wrote extensively on Johann Gottlieb Fichte. He is buried in the Jewish section of Père-Lachaise Cemetery."
Jules Lequier,"Jules Lequier was a French philosopher from Brittany. Lequier came to death presumably as a suicide by swimming out into the ocean.

Lequier wrote in favour of dynamic divine omniscience wherein Gods knowledge of the future is one of possibilities rather than actualities. Omniscience under this view is the knowledge of necessary facts as necessary and contingent facts as contingent. Since the future does not yet exist as anything more than a realm of abstract possibilities it is no impugning of divine omniscience to claim that God does not know the future as a fixed and unalterable state of affairs that he does not know what is not there to be known. Lequiers approach guarantees both divine and human freedom and suggests a partial resolution of the apparent inconsistency of human-wrought evil and the perfect goodness power and knowledge of God."
Pierre Leroux,"Pierre Henri Leroux was a French philosopher and political economist. He was born at Bercy now a part of Paris the son of an artisan.

His education was interrupted by the death of his father which compelled him to support his mother and family. Having worked first as a mason and then as a compositor he joined P. Dubois in the foundation of Le Globe which became in 1831 the official organ of the Saint-Simonian community of which he became a prominent member. In November of the same year when Prosper Enfantin became leader of the Saint-Simonians and preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the couple-prétre Leroux separated himself from the sect. In 1834 he published an essay entitled Individualism and Socialism which despite its message of scepticism towards both tendencies introduced the term socialism in French political discourse. In 1838 with Jean Reynaud who had seceded with him he founded the Encyclopédie nouvelle . Amongst the articles which he inserted in it were De legalité and Refutation de léclectisme which afterwards appeared as separate works.

In 1840 he published his treatise De lhumanité which contains the fullest exposition of his system and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In 1841 he established the Revue indépendante with the aid of George Sand over whom he had great influence. Her Spiridion which was dedicated to him Sept cordes de la lyre Consuelo and La Comtesse de Rudolstadt were written under the Humanitarian inspiration. Leroux also became embroiled in the philosophical controversy between F.W.J. Schelling and the Young Hegelians in the early 1840s. A favourable comment about Schelling prompted a public reply from Hegels disciple Karl Rosenkranz. Leroux continued to take an interest in German philosophy and literature; he also translated and commented on some writings by Goethe.

In 1843 he established at Boussac a printing association organized according to his systematic ideas and founded the Revue sociale. At the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848 Leroux proclaimed the republic in the town of Boussac becoming its mayor on February 25.

An opponent of Louis Bonaparte Leroux went into exile after the coup détat of 1851 settling with his family in Jersey where he pursued agricultural experiments and wrote his socialist poem La Grève de Samarez. Marx nominated Leroux for the Central Committee of the International Workingmens Association. On the definitive amnesty of 1869 he returned to Paris. He supported the Paris Commune but died before its suppression.

Leroux thought is a unique medley of doctrines borrowed from Saint-Simonian German Idealist Pythagorean and Buddhistic sources. His fundamental philosophical principle is that of what he calls the triada triplicity which he finds to pervade all things which in God is power intelligence and love in man sensation sentiment and knowledge.

His religious doctrine is pantheistic; and rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly conceived he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis. In social economy he preserves the family country and property but finds in all three as they now are a despotism which must be eliminated. He imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished. His solution seems to require the creation of families without heads countries without governments and property without right of possession. In politics he advocates absolute equality a democracy.

Lerouxs significance in the history of ideas lies in his attempt to resuscitate spirituality and community in France in the wake of the revolutionary decades of the 1790s and the Napoleonic Era."
Pierre-Sylvain Régis,"Pierre Sylvain Régis was a French Cartesian philosopher and a prominent critic of Spinoza. Known as a philosopher he was nominated to the French Academy of Sciences in 1699.

Born at La Salvetat de Blanquefort near Agen he had a classical education and then went to Paris. He attended the lectures of Jacques Rohault and became a follower of the philosophy of René Descartes. He then taught the principles of Cartesianism at Toulouse Aigues-Mortes Montpellier and Paris . The prohibition issued against the teaching of Cartesianism put an end to his lectures.

Régis was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1699. He died in Paris in 1707.

His major work was his Cours entier de philosophie ou Système général selon les principles de Descartes where he presented in a systematic way the principles of Cartesian philosophy. Opposed to Malebranches idealism against which he wrote in the Journal des Savants Régis modified the system of Descartes on various points in the direction of empiricism. He denied that the human soul has innate and eternal ideas maintained that all our ideas are modifications of the soul united to the body and that we can know our body and extension as immediately as our soul and thought.

The Cours was criticized by Pierre Daniel Huet and the Parisian Professor Jean Duhamel. Régis then wrote Réponse au livre qui a pour titre Censura philosophiæ Cartesianæ and Réponse aux reflexions critique de M. Duhamel sur le système cartésian de M. Régis . Among his other works were Usage de la raison et de la foi ou laccord de la raison et de la foi with a Réfutation de lopinion de Spinoza touchant lexistence et la nature de Dieu."
Édouard Le Roy,"Le Roy was received at the École Normale Supérieure in 1892 and at the agrégation in mathematics in 1895. He became Doctor in Sciences in 1898 taught in several high schools and became in 1909 professor of mathematics at the Lycée Saint-Louis in Paris.

From then on Le Roy took an important interest in philosophy and metaphysics. A friend of Teilhard de Chardin and Henri Bergsons closer disciple he succeeded Bergson at the College of France and in 1945 at the Académie française. In 1919 Le Roy was also elected member of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques.

Le Roy was especially interested in the relations between science and morality. Along with Henri Poincaré and Pierre Duhem he supported a conventionalist thesis on the foundation of mathematics. Although a fervent Catholic he extended this conventionalist theory to revealed truths which did not according to him withdraw any of their strength. He rejected in the domain of religious dogmas abstract reasonings and speculative theology in favour of instinctive faith heart and sentiment. He was one of those close to Bergson who encouraged him to turn to the study of mysticism explored in his later works. His conventionalism led his works charged of modernism to be placed on the Index by the Holy See."
René Le Senne,René Le Senne was a French idealist philosopher and psychologist.
Claude Lévi-Strauss,"Claude Lévi-Strauss was a French anthropologist and ethnologist whose work was key in the development of the theories of structuralism and structural anthropology. He held the chair of Social Anthropology at the Collège de France between 1959 and 1982 was elected a member of the Académie française in 1973 and was a member of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris. He received numerous honors from universities and institutions throughout the world.

Lévi-Strauss argued that the savage mind had the same structures as the civilized mind and that human characteristics are the same everywhere. These observations culminated in his famous book Tristes Tropiques that established his position as one of the central figures in the structuralist school of thought. As well as sociology his ideas reached into many fields in the humanities including philosophy. Structuralism has been defined as the search for the underlying patterns of thought in all forms of human activity. He won the 1986 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

Gustave Claude Lévi-Strauss was born in 1908 to French-Jewish parents who were living in Brussels at the time where his father was working as a portrait painter. He grew up in Paris living on a street of the upscale 16th arrondissement named after the artist Claude Lorrain whose work he admired and later wrote about. During the First World War from age 6 to 10 he lived with his maternal grandfather who was the rabbi of Versailles. Despite his religious environment early on Claude Lévi-Strauss was an atheist or agnostic at least in his adult life.

From 1918 to 1925 he studied at Lycée Janson de Sailly middle school receiving a baccalaureate in June 1925 . In his last year he was introduced to philosophy including the works of Marx and Kant and began shifting to the political left . From 1925 he spent the next 2 years at the prestigious Lycée Condorcet preparing for the entrance exam to the highly selective École normale supérieure. However for reasons that are not entirely clear he decided not to take the exam. In 1926 he went to Sorbonne in Paris studying law and philosophy as well as engaging in socialist politics and activism. In 1929 he opted for philosophy over law and from 1930-1931 put politics aside to focus on preparing for the agrégation in philosophy in order to qualify as a professor. In 1931 he passed the agrégation coming in 3rd place and youngest in his class at age 22. By this time the Great Depression had hit France and Lévi-Strauss found himself needing to provide not only for himself but his parents as well.

In 1935 after a few years of secondary-school teaching he took up a last-minute offer to be part of a French cultural mission to Brazil in which he would serve as a visiting professor of sociology at the University of São Paulo while his then wife Dina served as a visiting professor of ethnology.

The couple lived and did their anthropological work in Brazil from 1935 to 1939. During this time while he was a visiting professor of sociology Claude undertook his only ethnographic fieldwork. He accompanied Dina a trained ethnographer in her own right who was also a visiting professor at the University of São Paulo where they conducted research forays into the Mato Grosso and the Amazon Rainforest. They first studied the Guaycuru and Bororó Indian tribes staying among them for a few days. In 1938 they returned for a second more than half-year-long expedition to study the Nambikwara and Tupi-Kawahib societies. At this time his wife suffered an eye infection that prevented her from completing the study which he concluded. This experience cemented Lévi-Strausss professional identity as an anthropologist. Edmund Leach suggests from Lévi-Strausss own accounts in Tristes Tropiques that he could not have spent more than a few weeks in any one place and was never able to converse easily with any of his native informants in their native language which is uncharacteristic of anthropological research methods of participatory interaction with subjects to gain a full understanding of a culture.

A day will come when the thought that to feed themselves men of the past raised and massacred living beings and complacently exposed their shredded flesh in displays shall no doubt inspire the same repulsion as that of the travellers of the 16th and 17th century facing cannibal meals of savage American primitives in America Oceania Asia or Africa.

Lévi-Strauss returned to France in 1939 to take part in the war effort and was assigned as a liaison agent to the Maginot Line. After the French capitulation in 1940 he was employed at a lycée in Montpellier but then was dismissed under the Vichy racial laws . By the same laws he was denaturalized stripped of his French citizenship.

Around that time his first wife and he separated. She stayed behind and worked in the French resistance while he managed to escape Vichy France by boat to Martinique from where he was finally able to continue traveling. .

In 1941 he was offered a position at the New School for Social Research in New York City and granted admission to the United States. A series of voyages brought him via South America to Puerto Rico where he was investigated by the FBI after German letters in his luggage aroused the suspicions of customs agents. Lévi-Strauss spent most of the war in New York City. Along with Jacques Maritain Henri Focillon and Roman Jakobson he was a founding member of the École Libre des Hautes Études a sort of university-in-exile for French academics.

The war years in New York were formative for Lévi-Strauss in several ways. His relationship with Jakobson helped shape his theoretical outlook . In addition Lévi-Strauss was also exposed to the American anthropology espoused by Franz Boas who taught at Columbia University. In 1942 while having dinner at the Faculty House at Columbia Boas died in Lévi-Strausss arms. This intimate association with Boas gave his early work a distinctive American inclination that helped facilitate its acceptance in the U.S.

After a brief stint from 1946 to 1947 as a cultural attaché to the French embassy in Washington DC Lévi-Strauss returned to Paris in 1948. At this time he received his state doctorate from the Sorbonne by submitting in the French tradition both a major and a minor doctoral thesis. These were La vie familiale et sociale des indiens Nambikwara and Les structures élémentaires de la parenté .

In 2008 he became the first member of the Académie française to reach the age of 100 and one of the few living authors to have his works published in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade. On the death of Maurice Druon on 14 April 2009 he became the Dean of the Académie its longest-serving member.

He died on 30 October 2009 a few weeks before his 101st birthday. The death was announced four days later.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy described him as one of the greatest ethnologists of all time.Bernard Kouchner the French Foreign Minister said Lévi-Strauss broke with an ethnocentric vision of history and humanity ... At a time when we are trying to give meaning to globalisation to build a fairer and more humane world I would like Claude Lévi-Strausss universal echo to resonate more strongly. In a similar vein a statement by Lévi-Strauss was broadcast on National Public Radio in the remembrance produced by All Things Considered on 3 November 2009 There is today a frightful disappearance of living species be they plants or animals. And its clear that the density of human beings has become so great if I can say so that they have begun to poison themselves. And the world in which I am finishing my existence is no longer a world that I like. The Daily Telegraph said in its obituary that Lévi-Strauss was one of the dominating postwar influences in French intellectual life and the leading exponent of Structuralism in the social sciences. Permanent secretary of the Académie française Hélène Carrère dEncausse said He was a thinker a philosopher.... We will not find another like him.

The Elementary Structures of Kinship was published in 1949 and quickly came to be regarded as one of the most important anthropological works on kinship. It was even reviewed favorably by Simone de Beauvoir who saw it as an important statement of the position of women in non-Western cultures. A play on the title of Durkheims famous Elementary Forms of the Religious Life Lévi-Strauss Elementary Structures re-examined how people organized their families by examining the logical structures that underlay relationships rather than their contents. While British anthropologists such as Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown argued that kinship was based on descent from a common ancestor Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship was based on the alliance between two families that formed when women from one group married men from another.

Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s Lévi-Strauss continued to publish and experienced considerable professional success. On his return to France he became involved with the administration of the CNRS and the Musée de lHomme before finally becoming professor of the fifth section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études the Religious Sciences section where Marcel Mauss was previously professor the title of which chair he renamed Comparative Religion of Non-Literate Peoples.

While Lévi-Strauss was well known in academic circles in 1955 he became one of Frances best known intellectuals by publishing Tristes Tropiques in Paris that year by Plon . Essentially this book was a memoir detailing his time as a French expatriate throughout the 1930s and his travels. Lévi-Strauss combined exquisitely beautiful prose dazzling philosophical meditation and ethnographic analysis of the Amazonian peoples to produce a masterpiece. The organizers of the Prix Goncourt for instance lamented that they were not able to award Lévi-Strauss the prize because Tristes Tropiques was nonfiction.

Lévi-Strauss was named to a chair in social anthropology at the Collège de France in 1959. At roughly the same time he published Structural Anthropology a collection of his essays which provided both examples and programmatic statements about structuralism. At the same time as he was laying the groundwork for an intellectual program he began a series of institutions to establish anthropology as a discipline in France including the Laboratory for Social Anthropology where new students could be trained and a new journal lHomme for publishing the results of their research.

In 1962 Lévi-Strauss published what is for many people his most important work La Pensée Sauvage translated into English as The Savage Mind. The French title is an untranslatable pun as the word pensée means both thought and pansy while sauvage has a range of meanings different from English savage. Lévi-Strauss supposedly suggested that the English title be Pansies for Thought borrowing from a speech by Ophelia in Shakespeares Hamlet . French editions of La Pensée Sauvage are often printed with an image of wild pansies on the cover.

The Savage Mind discusses not just primitive thought a category defined by previous anthropologists but also forms of thought common to all human beings. The first half of the book lays out Lévi-Strausss theory of culture and mind while the second half expands this account into a theory of history and social change. This latter part of the book engaged Lévi-Strauss in a heated debate with Jean-Paul Sartre over the nature of human freedom. On the one hand Sartres existentialist philosophy committed him to a position that human beings fundamentally were free to act as they pleased. On the other hand Sartre also was a leftist who was committed to ideas such as that individuals were constrained by the ideologies imposed on them by the powerful. Lévi-Strauss presented his structuralist notion of agency in opposition to Sartre. Echoes of this debate between structuralism and existentialism eventually inspired the work of younger authors such as Pierre Bourdieu.

Now a worldwide celebrity Lévi-Strauss spent the second half of the 1960s working on his master project a four-volume study called Mythologiques. In it he followed a single myth from the tip of South America and all of its variations from group to group north through Central America and eventually into the Arctic Circle thus tracing the myths cultural evolution from one end of the Western Hemisphere to the other. He accomplished this in a typically structuralist way examining the underlying structure of relationships among the elements of the story rather than by focusing on the content of the story itself. While Pensée Sauvage was a statement of Lévi-Strausss big-picture theory Mythologiques was an extended four-volume example of analysis. Richly detailed and extremely long it is less widely read than the much shorter and more accessible Pensée Sauvage despite its position as Lévi-Strausss masterwork.

Lévi-Strauss completed the final volume of Mythologiques in 1971. On 14 May 1973 he was elected to the Académie française Frances highest honour for a writer. He was a member of other notable academies worldwide including the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1956 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the Erasmus Prize in 1973 the Meister-Eckhart-Prize for philosophy in 2003 and several honorary doctorates from universities such as Oxford Harvard Yale and Columbia. He also was the recipient of the Grand-croix de la Légion dhonneur was a Commandeur de lordre national du Mérite and Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres. In 2005 he received the XVII Premi Internacional Catalunya . After his retirement he continued to publish occasional meditations on art music philosophy and poetry.

Lévi-Strauss sought to apply the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure to anthropology. At the time the family was traditionally considered the fundamental object of analysis but was seen primarily as a self-contained unit consisting of a husband a wife and their children. Nephews cousins aunts uncles and grandparents all were treated as secondary. Lévi-Strauss argued that akin to Saussures notion of linguistic value families acquire determinate identities only through relations with one another. Thus he inverted the classical view of anthropology putting the secondary family members first and insisting on analyzing the relations between units instead of the units themselves.

In his own analysis of the formation of the identities that arise through marriages between tribes Lévi-Strauss noted that the relation between the uncle and the nephew was to the relation between brother and sister as the relation between father and son is to that between husband and wife that is A is to B as C is to D. Therefore if we know A B and C we can predict D just as if we know A and D we can predict B and C. The goal of Lévi-Strausss structural anthropology then was to simplify the masses of empirical data into generalized comprehensible relations between units which allow for predictive laws to be identified such as A is to B as C is to D.

Lévi-Strausss theory is set forth in Structural Anthropology . Briefly he considers culture a system of symbolic communication to be investigated with methods that others have used more narrowly in the discussion of novels political speeches sports and movies. His reasoning makes best sense when contrasted against the background of an earlier generations social theory. He wrote about this relationship for decades.

A preference for functionalist explanations dominated the social sciences from the turn of the 20th century through the 1950s which is to say that anthropologists and sociologists tried to state the purpose of a social act or institution. The existence of a thing was explained if it fulfilled a function. The only strong alternative to that kind of analysis was historical explanation accounting for the existence of a social fact by stating how it came to be.

The idea of social function developed in two different ways however. The English anthropologist Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown who had read and admired the work of the French sociologist Émile Durkheim argued that the goal of anthropological research was to find the collective function such as what a religious creed or a set of rules about marriage did for the social order as a whole. Behind this approach was an old idea the view that civilization developed through a series of phases from the primitive to the modern everywhere in the same manner. All of the activities in a given kind of society would partake of the same character; some sort of internal logic would cause one level of culture to evolve into the next. On this view a society can easily be thought of as an organism the parts functioning together as do the parts of a body. In contrast the more influential functionalism of Bronisław Malinowski described the satisfaction of individual needs what a person derived by participating in a custom.

In the United States where the shape of anthropology was set by the German-educated Franz Boas the preference was for historical accounts. This approach had obvious problems which Lévi-Strauss praises Boas for facing squarely. Historical information seldom is available for non-literate cultures. The anthropologist fills in with comparisons to other cultures and is forced to rely on theories that have no evidential basis the old notion of universal stages of development or the claim that cultural resemblances are based on some unrecognized past contact between groups. Boas came to believe that no overall pattern in social development could be proven; for him there was no single history only histories.

There are three broad choices involved in the divergence of these schools; each had to decide

Social scientists in all traditions relied on cross-cultural studies as it was always necessary to supplement information about a society with information about others. Thus some idea of a common human nature was implicit in each approach. The critical distinction then remained twofold

For Lévi-Strauss the choice was for the demands of the social order. He had no difficulty bringing out the inconsistencies and triviality of individualistic accounts. Malinowski said for example that magic beliefs come into being when people need to feel a sense of control over events when the outcome was uncertain. In the Trobriand Islands he found the proof of this claim in the rites surrounding abortions and weaving skirts. But in the same tribes there is no magic attached to making clay pots even though it is no more certain a business than weaving. So the explanation is not consistent. Furthermore these explanations tend to be used in an ad hoc superficial wayone postulates a trait of personality when needed. However the accepted way of discussing organizational function didnt work either. Different societies might have institutions that were similar in many obvious ways and yet served different functions. Many tribal cultures divide the tribe into two groups and have elaborate rules about how the two groups may interact. However exactly what they may dotrade intermarryis different in different tribes; for that matter so are the criteria for distinguishing the groups. Nor will it do to say that dividing-in-two is a universal need of organizations because there are a lot of tribes that thrive without it.

For Lévi-Strauss the methods of linguistics became a model for all his earlier examinations of society. His analogies usually are from phonology . A really scientific analysis must be real simplifying and explanatory he writes.Phonemic analysis reveals features that are real in the sense that users of the language can recognize and respond to them. At the same time a phoneme is an abstraction from languagenot a sound but a category of sound defined by the way it is distinguished from other categories through rules unique to the language. The entire sound-structure of a language may be generated from a relatively small number of rules.

In the study of the kinship systems that first concerned him this ideal of explanation allowed a comprehensive organization of data that partly had been ordered by other researchers. The overall goal was to find out why family relations differed among various South American cultures. The father might have great authority over the son in one group for example with the relationship rigidly restricted by taboos. In another group the mothers brother would have that kind of relationship with the son while the fathers relationship was relaxed and playful.

A number of partial patterns had been noted. Relations between the mother and father for example had some sort of reciprocity with those of father and sonif the mother had a dominant social status and was formal with the father for example then the father usually had close relations with the son. But these smaller patterns joined together in inconsistent ways. One possible way of finding a master order was to rate all the positions in a kinship system along several dimensions. For example the father was older than the son the father produced the son the father had the same sex as the son and so on; the matrilineal uncle was older and of the same sex but did not produce the son and so on. An exhaustive collection of such observations might cause an overall pattern to emerge.

However for Lévi-Strauss this kind of work was considered analytical in appearance only. It results in a chart that is far more difficult to understand than the original data and is based on arbitrary abstractions . Furthermore it doesnt explain anything. The explanation it offers is tautologicalif age is crucial then age explains a relationship. And it does not offer the possibility of inferring the origins of the structure.

A proper solution to the puzzle is to find a basic unit of kinship which can explain all the variations. It is a cluster of four rolesbrother sister father son. These are the roles that must be involved in any society that has an incest taboo requiring a man to obtain a wife from some man outside his own hereditary line. A brother may give away his sister for example whose son might reciprocate in the next generation by allowing his own sister to marry exogamously. The underlying demand is a continued circulation of women to keep various clans peacefully related.

Right or wrong this solution displays the qualities of structural thinking. Even though Lévi-Strauss frequently speaks of treating culture as the product of the axioms and corollaries that underlie it or the phonemic differences that constitute it he is concerned with the objective data of field research. He notes that it is logically possible for a different atom of kinship structure to existsister sisters brother brothers wife daughterbut there are no real-world examples of relationships that can be derived from that grouping. The trouble with this view has been shown by Australian anthropologist Augustus Elkin who insisted on the point that in a four class marriage system the preferred marriage was with a classificatory mothers brothers daughter and never with the true one. Lévi-Strausss atom of kinship structure deals only with consanguineal kin. There is a big difference between the two situations in that the kinship structure involving the classificatory kin relations allows for the building of a system which can bring together thousands of people. Lévi-Strausss atom of kinship stops working once the true MoBrDa is missing. Lévi-Strauss also developed the concept of the house society to describe those societies where the domestic unit is more central for social organization than the descent group or lineage.

The purpose of structuralist explanation is to organize real data in the simplest effective way. All science he says is either structuralist or reductionist. In confronting such matters as the incest taboo one is facing an objective limit of what the human mind has accepted so far. One could hypothesize some biological imperative underlying it but so far as social order is concerned the taboo has the effect of an irreducible fact. The social scientist can only work with the structures of human thought that arise from it. And structural explanations can be tested and refuted. A mere analytic scheme that wishes causal relations into existence is not structuralist in this sense.

Lévi-Strausss later works are more controversial in part because they impinge on the subject matter of other scholars. He believed that modern life and all history was founded on the same categories and transformations that he had discovered in the Brazilian backcountryThe Raw and the Cooked From Honey to Ashes The Naked Man . For instance he compares anthropology to musical serialism and defends his philosophical approach. He also pointed out that the modern view of primitive cultures was simplistic in denying them a history. The categories of myth did not persist among them because nothing had happenedit was easy to find the evidence of defeat migration exile repeated displacements of all the kinds known to recorded history. Instead the mythic categories had encompassed these changes.

He argued for a view of human life as existing in two timelines simultaneously the eventful one of history and the long cycles in which one set of fundamental mythic patterns dominates and then perhaps another. In this respect his work resembles that of Fernand Braudel the historian of the Mediterranean and la longue durée the cultural outlook and forms of social organization that persisted for centuries around that sea. He is right in that history is difficult to build up in non literate society nevertheless Jean Guiarts anthropological and José Garangers archeological work in central Vanuatu bringing to the fore the skeletons of former chiefs described in local myths who had thus been living persons shows that there can be some means of ascertaining the history of some groups which otherwise would be deemed a-historical. Another issue is the experience that the same person can tell one a myth highly charged in symbols and some years later a sort of chronological history claiming to be the chronic of a descent line the two texts having in common that they each deal in topographical detail with the land-tenure claims of the said descent line . Lévi-Strauss would agree to these aspects be explained inside his seminar but would never touch them on his own. The anthropological data content of the myths was not his problem. He was only interested with the formal aspects of each story considered by him as the result of the workings of the collective unconscious of each group which idea was taken from the linguists but cannot be proved in any way although he was adamant about its existence and would never accept any discussion on this point.

Similar to his anthropological theories Lévi-Strauss identified myths as a type of speech through which a language could be discovered. His work is a structuralist theory of mythology which attempted to explain how seemingly fantastical and arbitrary tales could be so similar across cultures. Because he believed there was no one authentic version of a myth rather that they were all manifestations of the same language he sought to find the fundamental units of myth namely the mytheme. Lévi-Strauss broke each of the versions of a myth down into a series of sentences consisting of a relation between a function and a subject. Sentences with the same function were given the same number and bundled together. These are mythemes.

What Lévi-Strauss believed he had discovered when he examined the relations between mythemes was that a myth consists of juxtaposed binary oppositions. Oedipus for example consists of the overrating of blood relations and the underrating of blood relations the autochthonous origin of humans and the denial of their autochthonous origin. Influenced by Hegel Lévi-Strauss believed that the human mind thinks fundamentally in these binary oppositions and their unification and that these are what makes meaning possible. Furthermore he considered the job of myth to be a sleight of hand an association of an irreconcilable binary opposition with a reconcilable binary opposition creating the illusion or belief that the former had been resolved.

Lévi-Strauss sees a basic paradox in the study of myth. On one hand mythical stories are fantastic and unpredictable the content of myth seems completely arbitrary. On the other hand the myths of different cultures are surprisingly similar

On the one hand it would seem that in the course of a myth anything is likely to happen. ... But on the other hand this apparent arbitrariness is belied by the astounding similarity between myths collected in widely different regions. Therefore the problem If the content of myth is contingent how are we to explain the fact that myths throughout the world are so similar

Lévi-Strauss proposed that universal laws must govern mythical thought and resolve this seeming paradox producing similar myths in different cultures. Each myth may seem unique but he proposed it is just one particular instance of a universal law of human thought. In studying myth Lévi-Strauss tries to reduce apparently arbitrary data to some kind of order and to attain a level at which a kind of necessity becomes apparent underlying the illusions of liberty. Laurie suggests that for Levi-Strauss operations embedded within animal myths provide opportunities to resolve collective problems of classification and hierarchy marking lines between the inside and the outside the Law and its exceptions those who belong and those who do not.

According to Lévi-Strauss mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution. In other words myths consist of

For example Lévi-Strauss thinks the trickster of many Native American mythologies acts as a mediator. Lévi-Strausss argument hinges on two facts about the Native American trickster

Lévi-Strauss argues that the raven and coyote mediate the opposition between life and death. The relationship between agriculture and hunting is analogous to the opposition between life and death agriculture is solely concerned with producing life ; hunting is concerned with producing death. Furthermore the relationship between herbivores and beasts of prey is analogous to the relationship between agriculture and hunting like agriculture herbivores are concerned with plants; like hunting beasts of prey are concerned with catching meat. Lévi-Strauss points out that the raven and coyote eat carrion and are therefore halfway between herbivores and beasts of prey like beasts of prey they eat meat; like herbivores they dont catch their food. Thus he argues we have a mediating structure of the following type

By uniting herbivore traits with traits of beasts of prey the raven and coyote somewhat reconcile herbivores and beasts of prey in other words they mediate the opposition between herbivores and beasts of prey. As we have seen this opposition ultimately is analogous to the opposition between life and death. Therefore the raven and coyote ultimately mediate the opposition between life and death. This Lévi-Strauss believes explains why the coyote and raven have a contradictory personality when they appear as the mythical trickster

The trickster is a mediator. Since his mediating function occupies a position halfway between two polar terms he must retain something of that dualitynamely an ambiguous and equivocal character.

Because the raven and coyote reconcile profoundly opposed concepts their own mythical personalities must reflect this duality or contradiction in other words they must have a contradictory tricky personality.

This theory about the structure of myth helps support Lévi-Strausss more basic theory about human thought. According to this more basic theory universal laws govern all areas of human thought

If it were possible to prove in this instance too that the apparent arbitrariness of the mind its supposedly spontaneous flow of inspiration and its seemingly uncontrolled inventiveness laws operating at a deeper level...if the human mind appears determined even in the realm of mythology a fortiori it must also be determined in all its spheres of activity.

Out of all the products of culture myths seem the most fantastic and unpredictable. Therefore Lévi-Strauss claims if even mythical thought obeys universal laws then all human thought must obey universal laws.

Lévi-Strauss developed the comparison of the Bricoleur and Engineer in The Savage Mind.

Bricoleur has its origin in the old French verb bricoler which originally referred to extraneous movements in ball games billiards hunting shooting and riding but which today means do-it-yourself building or repairing things with the tools and materials on hand puttering or tinkering as it were. In comparison to the true craftsman whom Lévi-Strauss calls the Engineer the Bricoleur is adept at many tasks and at putting preexisting things together in new ways adapting his project to a finite stock of materials and tools.

The Engineer deals with projects in their entirety conceiving and procuring all the necessary materials and tools to suit his project. The Bricoleur approximates the savage mind and the Engineer approximates the scientific mind. Lévi-Strauss says that the universe of the Bricoleur is closed and he often is forced to make do with whatever is at hand whereas the universe of the Engineer is open in that he is able to create new tools and materials. However both live within a restrictive reality and so the Engineer is forced to consider the preexisting set of theoretical and practical knowledge of technical means in a similar way to the Bricoleur.

Lévi-Strausss theory on the origin of the Trickster has been criticized on a number of points by anthropologists.

Stanley Diamond notes that while the secular civilized often consider the concepts of life and death to be polar primitive cultures often see them as aspects of a single condition the condition of existence. Diamond remarks that Lévi-Strauss did not reach such a conclusion by inductive reasoning but simply by working backwards from the evidence to the a priori mediated concepts of life and death which he reached by assumption of a necessary progression from life to agriculture to herbivorous animals and from death to warfare to beasts of prey. For that matter the coyote is well known to hunt in addition to scavenging and the raven also has been known to act as a bird of prey in contrast to Lévi-Strausss conception. Nor does that conception explain why a scavenger such as a bear would never appear as the Trickster. Diamond further remarks that the Trickster names raven and coyote which Lévi-Strauss explains can be arrived at with greater economy on the basis of let us say the cleverness of the animals involved their ubiquity elusiveness capacity to make mischief their undomesticated reflection of certain human traits. Finally Lévi-Strausss analysis does not appear to be capable of explaining why representations of the Trickster in other areas of the world make use of such animals as the spider and mantis.

Edmund Leach wrote that The outstanding characteristic of his writing whether in French or English is that it is difficult to understand; his sociological theories combine baffling complexity with overwhelming erudition. Some readers even suspect that they are being treated to a confidence trick. Sociologist Stanislav Andreski criticized Lévi-Strausss work generally arguing that his scholarship was often sloppy and moreover that much of his mystique and reputation stemmed from his threatening people with mathematics a reference to Lévi-Strausss use of quasi-algebraic equations to explain his ideas. Drawing on postcolonial approaches to anthropology Timothy Laurie has suggested that Lévi-Strauss speaks from the vantage point of a State intent on securing knowledge for the purposes of as he himself would often claim salvaging local cultures...but the salvation workers also ascribe to themselves legitimacy and authority in the process.

He married Dina Dreyfus in 1932. They later divorced. He was then to married Rose Marie Ullmo from 1946 to 1954. They had one son Laurent. His third and last wife was Monique Roman; they were married in 1954. They had one son Matthieu."
Emmanuel Levinas,"Emmanuel Levinas was a French philosopher of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry who is known for his work within Jewish philosophy existentialism and phenomenology focusing on the relationship of ethics to metaphysics and ontology.

Emmanuelis Levinas was born in 1906 into a middle-class Litvak family in Kaunas in present-day Lithuania then Kovno district at the Western edge of the Russian Empire. Because of the disruptions of World War I the family moved to Charkow in the Region of Ukraine in 1916 where they stayed during the Russian revolutions of February and October 1917. In 1920 his family returned to the Republic of Lithuania. Levinass early education was in secular Russian-language schools in Kaunas and Charkow. Upon his familys return to the Republic of Lithuania Levinas spent two years at a Jewish gymnasium before departing for France where he commenced his university education.

Levinas began his philosophical studies at the University of Strasbourg in 1923 and his lifelong friendship with the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot. In 1928 he went to the University of Freiburg for two semesters to study phenomenology under Edmund Husserl. At Freiburg he also met Martin Heidegger whose philosophy greatly impressed him. Levinas would in the early 1930s be one of the first French intellectuals to draw attention to Heidegger and Husserl by translating in 1931 Husserls Cartesian Meditations and by drawing on their ideas in his own philosophy in works such as La théorie de lintuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl De lExistence à lExistant and En Découvrant lExistence avec Husserl et Heidegger . In 1929 he was awarded his doctorate by the University of Strasbourg for his thesis on the meaning of intuition in the philosophy of Husserl published in 1930.

Levinas became a naturalized French citizen in 1939. When France declared war on Germany he reported for military duty as a translator of Russian and French. During the German invasion of France in 1940 his military unit was surrounded and forced to surrender. Levinas spent the rest of World War II as a prisoner of war in a camp near Hannover in Germany. Levinas was assigned to a special barrack for Jewish prisoners who were forbidden any form of religious worship. Life in the Fallingbostel camp was difficult but his status as a prisoner of war protected him from the Holocausts concentration camps. Other prisoners saw him frequently jotting in a notebook. These jottings were later developed into his book De lExistence à lExistant and a series of lectures published under the title Le Temps et lAutre . His wartime notebooks have now been published in their original form as Œuvres Tome 1 Carnets de captivité suivi de Écrits sur la captivité; et Notes philosophiques diverses .

Meanwhile Maurice Blanchot helped Levinass wife and daughter spend the war in a monastery thus sparing them from the Holocaust. Blanchot at considerable personal risk also saw to it that Levinas was able to keep in contact with his immediate family through letters and other messages. Other members of Levinass family were not so fortunate; his mother-in-law was deported and never heard from again while his father and brothers were killed in Lithuania by the SS.

After the Second World War he studied the Talmud under the enigmatic Monsieur Chouchani whose influence he acknowledged only late in his life.

Levinass first book-length essay Totality and Infinity was written as his Doctorat dÉtat primary thesis . His secondary thesis was titled Études sur la phénoménologie . After earning his habilitation Levinas taught at a private Jewish High School in Paris the École normale Israélite orientale eventually becoming its director. He began teaching at the University of Poitiers in 1961 at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris in 1967 and at the Sorbonne in 1973 from which he retired in 1979. He published his second major philosophical work Autrement quêtre ou au-delà de lessence in 1974. He was also a Professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. In 1989 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Philosophy.

According to his obituary in The New York Times Levinas came to regret his early enthusiasm for Heidegger after the latter joined the Nazis. Levinas explicitly frames several of his mature philosophical works as attempts to respond to Heideggers philosophy in light of its ethical failings.

His son is the composer Michaël Levinas and his son-in-law is the French mathematician Georges Hansel. Among his most famous students is Rabbi Baruch Garzon from Tetouan who learnt Philosophy with Levinas at the Sorbonne and later went on to become one of the most important Rabbis of the Spanish-speaking world.

In the 1950s Levinas emerged from the circle of intellectuals surrounding the philosopher Jean Wahl as a leading French thinker. His work is based on the ethics of the Other or in Levinass terms on ethics as first philosophy. For Levinas the Other is not knowable and cannot be made into an object of the self as is done by traditional metaphysics . Levinas prefers to think of philosophy as the wisdom of love rather than the love of wisdom . In his view responsibility toward the Other precedes any objective searching after truth.

Levinas derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter with the Other. For Levinas the irreducible relation the epiphany of the face-to-face the encounter with another is a privileged phenomenon in which the other persons proximity and distance are both strongly felt. The Other precisely reveals himself in his alterity not in a shock negating the I but as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness. At the same time the revelation of the face makes a demand this demand is before one can express or know ones freedom to affirm or deny. One instantly recognizes the transcendence and heteronomy of the Other. Even murder fails as an attempt to take hold of this otherness.

While critical of traditional theology Levinas does require that a trace of the Divine be acknowledged within an ethics of Otherness. This is especially evident in his thematization of debt and guilt. A face is a trace of itself given over to my responsibility but to which I am wanting and faulty. It is as though I were responsible for his mortality and guilty for surviving. The moral authority of the face of the Other is felt in my infinite responsibility for the Other. The face of the Other comes toward me with its infinite moral demands while emerging out of the trace.

Apart from this morally imposing emergence the Others face might well be adequately addressed as Thou in whose welcoming countenance I might find great comfort love and communion of soulsbut not a moral demand bearing down upon me from a height. Through a trace the irreversible past takes on the profile of a He. The beyond from which a face comes is in the third person. It is because the Other also emerges from the illeity of a He that I instead fall into infinite debt vis-à-vis the Other in a situation of utterly asymmetrical obligations I owe the Other everything the Other owes me nothing. The trace of the Other is the heavy shadow of God the God who commands Thou shalt not kill Levinas takes great pains to avoid straightforward theological language. The very metaphysics of signification subtending theological language is suspected and suspended by evocations of how traces work differently than signs. Nevertheless the divinity of the trace is also undeniable the trace is not just one more word it is the proximity of God in the countenance of my fellowman. In a sense it is divine commandment without divine authority.

Following Totality and Infinity Levinas later argued that responsibility for the other is rooted within our subjective constitution. The first line of the preface of this book is everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality. This idea appears in his of recurrence in which Levinas maintains that subjectivity is formed in and through our subjection to the other. Subjectivity Levinas argued is primordially ethical not theoretical that is to say our responsibility for the other is not a derivative feature of our subjectivity but instead founds our subjective being-in-the-world by giving it a meaningful direction and orientation. Levinass thesis ethics as first philosophy then means that the traditional philosophical pursuit of knowledge is secondary to a basic ethical duty to the other. To meet the Other is to have the idea of Infinity.

The elderly Levinas was a distinguished French public intellectual whose books reportedly sold well. He had a major influence on the younger but more well-known Jacques Derrida whose seminal Writing and Difference contains an essay Violence and Metaphysics that was instrumental in expanding interest in Levinas in France and abroad. Derrida also delivered a eulogy at Levinass funeral later published as Adieu à Emmanuel Levinas an appreciation and exploration of Levinass moral philosophy. In a memorial essay for Levinas Jean-Luc Marion claimed that If one defines a great philosopher as someone without whom philosophy would not have been what it is then in France there are two great philosophers of the 20th Century Bergson and Lévinas.

His work has been a source of controversy since the 1950s when Simone de Beauvoir criticized his account of the subject as being necessarily masculine as defined against a feminine other. While other feminist philosophers like Tina Chanter and the artist-thinker Bracha L. Ettinger have defended him against this charge increasing interest in his work in the 2000s brought a reevaluation of the possible misogyny of his account of the feminine as well as a critical engagement with his French nationalism in the context of colonialism. Among the most prominent of these are critiques by Simon Critchley and Stella Sandford. However there have also been responses which argue that these critiques of Levinas are misplaced.

For three decades Levinas gave short talks on Rashi a medieval French rabbi every Shabbat morning at the Jewish high school in Paris where he was the principal. This tradition strongly influenced many generations of students.

Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne renowned Belgian filmmakers have referred to Levinas as an important underpinning for their filmmaking ethics.

In his book Levinas and the Cinema of Redemption Time Ethics and the Feminine author Sam B. Girgus argues that Levinas has dramatically affected films involving redemption.

Magician Derren Brown A Book of Secrets references Levinas.

A full bibliography of all Levinass publications up until 1981 is found in Roger Burggraeve Emmanuel Levinas .

A list of works translated into English but not appearing in any collections may be found in Critchley S. and Bernasconi R. The Cambridge Companion to Levinas pp.269270."
Benny Lévy,"Benny Lévy was a philosopher political activist and author. A political figure of May 1968 in France he was the disciple and last personal secretary of Jean-Paul Sartre from 1974 to 1980.Along with him he helped founding the French newspaper Libération in 1972.

After having encountered the Jewish philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas in 1978 he operated a return to tradition. He then founded the Institut détudes lévinassiennes in Jerusalem with Alain Finkielkraut and Bernard-Henri Lévy.

Benny Lévy is known for his unusual itinerary from Maoism to Judaism or from Mao to Moses which was also followed by a few other philosophers of his generation.

Born in Egypt Benny Lévy grew up without experiencing Judaism as a faith. He left Egypt after the Suez Crisis of 1956 and immigrated to Belgium then France with his family. His elder half-brother Eddy Lévy stayed in Egypt converted to Islam in 1956 and changed his name to Adil Rifaat. The historian of mathematics Tony Lévy is his brother.

Benny Lévy soon proved to be a brilliant student and completed his studies at the École Normale Supérieure learning under such key intellectual figures as Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida founder of deconstruction. He entered the Union des étudiants communistes a student communist group and then at his foundation in 1966 the Maoist Union des jeunesses communistes marxistes-léninistes . He became one of the main leader of this latter organization after Robert Linhart. Benny Lévy was an important figure during the May 68 Student Revolt. After these events the direction of the UJC-ml was put in minority and founded the Maoist Gauche prolétarienne . Taking the pseudonym of Pierre Victor Benny Lévy was one of its main leaders along with Alain Geismar.

As editor of the Maoist newspaper La Cause du Peuple he was arrested repeatedly by the French police who were determined to suppress the unrest. By 1970 with arrests occurring more frequently Lévy and the other editors decided to turn to Jean-Paul Sartre whom they knew benefited from protection to police harassment. Sartre responded by adding his name to the list of editors and the arrests indeed stopped. It was then discovered by the government that the proletarian leftwing leader Pierre Victor was in fact a stateless refugee. The passport given to him by the United Nations was confiscated and he was ordered to appear at the local police station once every two weeks with his relatives and a lawyer. The organisation was outlawed in 1970. As stateless and leader of an outlawed organisation Benni Lévy was forced to clandestinity until 1973 date of the auto-dissolving of the GP. By this point however Lévy had developed a very amicable relationship with Sartre who decided to make him his protégé and asked him to serve as his personal secretary which he remained from September 1974 till Sartres death in 1980. Sartre interceded to President Valéry Giscard dEstaing and Lévy was naturalized.

During these six years Lévy worked with Sartre and the two men produced four books until Sartres death. While working with Sartre Lévy began to discover Judaism initially through his research into the Kabbalah which he conducted with his mentor. Their work together created a stir among the circle that surrounded Sartre because Sartre had begun introducing new ideas and terms that evoked religious and more specifically Jewish concepts such as Redemption and Messianism. Some including Simone de Beauvoir began accusing Lévy of brainwashing Sartre and faking his writings. After this Ms de Beauvoir and Mr Levy were no longer on speaking terms. Two months before his death Sartre responded to these critics claiming that he had indeed abandoned some of his earlier ideas. In 1978 Lévy encountered Levinas and started learning Hebrew and beginning Talmudic studies.

Starting in 1975 he taught at the University of Paris-VII founded in the wake of May 68 before obtaining a doctorate in philosophy at the Sorbonne in 1985 and a habilitation to direct researches in philosophy in 1998 under the direction of Dominique Lecourt at Paris-VII.

Benny Lévy embraced Jewish Orthodoxy and began to study in a yeshiva in Strasbourg. He finally immigrated to Israel in 1997 where he established the Institut détudes lévinassiennes in Jerusalem along with Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut and learned with Rabbi Moshe Shapira. He died suddenly during the holiday of Sukkot in 2003. In Etre Juif he wrote

To be Jewish. To be in an absolutely singular manner... a thought of the Return. The Return to the Sinaï... The thought of the Return requires a critique of the atheology of the modern jew . Theology of the silence of God after Auschwitz critique of theodicy finally return to the notion of absolute Evil these are the points through which one must pass in a critical manner. In this sense this book addresses itself at any man insofar as he is still sensible to the question of the origin of evil."
Pierre Lévy,"Pierre Lévy is a Tunisian-born French philosopher cultural theorist and media scholar who specializes in the understanding of the cultural and cognitive implications of digital technologies and the phenomenon of human collective intelligence.

He introduced the collective intelligence concept in his 1994 book Lintelligence collective Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace . Lévys 1995 book Quest-ce que le virtuel develops philosopher Gilles Deleuzes conception of the virtual as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001 he wrote the book Cyberculture.

He was a professor at the communication department of the University of Ottawa where he hold a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and received several awards and academic distinctions. Pierre Lévy is currently retired and works on developing the Information Economy MetaLanguage .

Lévy was born in Tunisia to a Sephardic Jewish family before moving to France. He is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of cyberspace and digital communications. Lévy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work published in French in 1994 and translated into English is entitled Collective Intelligence Mankinds Emerging World in Cyberspace.

As early as 1990 Lévy published a book about the merging of digital networks and hypertextual communication. Lévys theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates wikinomics and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.

From 1993 to 1998 Lévy was Professor at the University of Paris VIII where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about cyberculture.

He was a member of the editorial board of the Revue virtuelle project of the Pompidou Center in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.

In the chapter Interactivity from his book Cyberculture Lévy argues that analogue communication differs from digital communication in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that interactivity is a vague term that has more to do with finding the solution to a problem the need to develop new ways to observe design and evaluate methods of communication than it does with identifying a simple unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system.Henry Jenkins among others cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.

In Becoming Virtual Reality in the Digital Age Lévy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives from real time interaction through language to our actions through technology and our social relations through institutions.

Lévys current project focuses on the development of an Information Economy MetaLanguage for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for semantic addressing of digital documents."
Lucien Lévy-Bruhl,"Lucien Lévy-Bruhl was a French scholar trained in philosophy who furthered anthropology with his contributions to the budding fields of sociology and ethnology. His primary field of study involved primitive mentality.

Born in Paris Lévy-Bruhl wrote about the primitive mind in his work How Natives Think where he posited as the two basic mindsets of mankind the primitive and the modern. The primitive mind does not differentiate the supernatural from reality but uses mystical participation to manipulate the world. According to Lévy-Bruhl the primitive mind does not address contradictions.

The modern mind by contrast uses reflection and logic. Lévy-Bruhl believed in a historical and evolutionary teleology leading from the primitive mind to the modern mind. Lévy-Bruhls How Natives Think was an accurate and valuable contribution to anthropology perhaps even more so than better-known work by Claude Lévi-Strauss.

Lévy-Bruhls work especially the concepts of collective representation and participation mystique influenced the psychological theory of C. G. Jung."
Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond,"Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond is a physicist and essayist.

After a doctorate in Theoretical Physics at the université dOrsay in 1965 he was successively in charge of research at CNRS lecturer at the université de Nice a professor at the Paris Diderot University and at Nice where he taught in the departments of physics philosophy and communication.

Since 2001 he has been Professor Emeritus at the Université de Nice and is program director at the Collège international de philosophie.

He has published many articles on theoretical physics mathematics and epistemology.

He founded and directs the journal Alliage directs the collection Science ouverte at Seuil and works more generally for the use of science in culture."
Jacqueline Lichtenstein,"Jacqueline Lichtenstein was a French philosopher art historian and professor of aesthetics and the philosophy of art at the University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne.

Her work focused on 17th century- and 18th-century art and the ways in which people think talk and theorize about art. Another theme of her work was the shift since the 17th century in how people think about the amateur.

Lichtenstein taught at the University of California at Berkeley the University of Paris X-Nanterre and at the University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne among other places. She published numerous articles in French and American journals.

She wad the joint director of a philosophy and sociology training and research unit at University Paris IV-Sorbonne where she coordinated a masters program in aesthetics and philosophy of art. She was also in charge of the series Essays on art and philosophy founded by Henri Gouhier in 1949 and published by Editions Vrin.

A central theme of Lichtensteins work is the reception of color by various disciplines such as philosophy art sociology and ethics. A focal point for her analysis was the antagonistic relationship between color and the notion of the design or plan of a work .

Philosophically suspect due to its material character morally culpable because of its seductive luster color in Lichtensteins view has long been deemed aesthetically dangerous the source of a pleasure and a beauty that does not at first blush seem connected with the True and the Good. This is she argued one aspect of an ongoing conflict between reason and the universe of sensible forms. Painting not being reducible to drawing it is a source of disunity and disorder in our systems of knowledge one which elicits an experience of lack .

The history of this conflict she argued begins in Platonic thought which condemns color and rhetoric equally. The arts of speech and those of imagery are thus definitively linked. A central later figure is Roger de Piles the leader of the Rubenists the partisans of color . The Rubenists broke with the Platonic tradition and defended illusion makeup and seduction. They shifted Lichtenstein maintained the focus to those feminine aspects of representation that is the suspected and cursed elements. They made these the essence of painting.

From that point onward painting was linked with the linguistically inexpressible. Only the gaze may be spoken of not the picture itself. This argued Lichtenstein was the birth of aesthetics in the sense that the word was to take on in the 17th century."
Gilles Lipovetsky,"Gilles Lipovetsky is a French philosopher writer and sociologist professor at Stendhal University in Grenoble Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes France.

Lipovetsky was born in Millau in 1944. He studied philosophy at University of Grenoble and participated in the 1968 student uprising in Paris to change the French educational model. However he criticizes the model that came from that as producing alienated individuals with fragile personalities prone to emotional disorder due to hedonism and immediate gratification.

He began his academic career teaching classes with his alma mater. With the success of his first book he has become well known in many parts of the world and has become one of the most important French intellectuals of the latter 20th century.

Along with tenure he has received two honorary doctorates from the Université de Sherbrooke in Québec and from the New Bulgarian University in Sofia membership in the Conseil danalyse de la société of the French government knighthood in the Legion of Honor membership in the National Council of Programs and is a consultant with the Association of Management Progress. In 2015 2016 and 2017 he was a member of the Prix Versailles judges panel.

Lipovetsky began his philosophical career as a Marxist similar to many others in the 1960s affiliated with the Socialisme ou Barbarie which demanded the world not to transform it but rather to swallow it. However since then his philosophy has changed significantly including the acceptance of capitalism as the only legitimate economic model. When questioned about his change in stance from his Marxist beginning he replies Only idiots never change opinion.

Lipovetskys work focuses on the modern world from the latter 20th century to the present. His has divided this time period into three periods Marxist self criticism post- modern and the hyper modern period from 1991 on. This began with his 1983 book which declared the world to be post-modern characterized by extreme individualism and the dissolution of politics based on political parties turning its back on a strong sense of social duty on which democracy and socialism depend. However by the end of the 2000s he proposed that this term had become obsolete and unable to describe the world past 1991. He then proposed hyper-modern similar to post-modern but with a superlative and unstoppable meaning focusing on new technologies markets and global culture.

From his 1983 book which brought him to prominence Lipovetsky has continued to write on topics such as modernity globalization consumerism modern culture markets feminism fashion and media but they have the common thread of individualism. He defines individualism as the desire to break with tradition and the past and to look towards the future and our own pleasure. In 1987 he wrote LEmpire de léphémère la mode et son destin dans les sociétés modernes continuing the argument of the 1983 work focusing on fashion as a reflection of individualism and hyper consumerism. It also indicates the desire to be young forever and that only the here-and-now exists. In 1992 he published Le Crépuscule du devoir. In this work he states that the vision of a secular world started with Martin Luthers revolt against the Catholic Church and developed by thinkers such as René Descartes Kant and Thomas Aquinas leading to the idea that one purpose of God is to define and protect individual rights. In La Troisième femme in 1997 he argues the idea that the womens liberation movement is strongly connected to hyper consumerism as women are the main customers of luxury goods. In Métamorphoses de la culture libérale Éthique médias entreprise in 2002 he examines the paradoxes of hyper modern democracies with emphasis both on the individual regionalization vs. globalization and the collective and a society that is both open and closed concluding that they are interdependent. The 2003 book Le luxe éternel examines the concept of luxury over human history. Le bonheur paradoxal. Essai sur la société dhyperconsommation in 2006 examines the multiplication and globalization of major brands and the connection between fashion and luxury which is the basis of hyper-consumerism. In La société de déception he analyzes the concept of disappointment following on the work of Jacques Lacan that desire creates a vacuum and can never be filled. In Lécran global. Culture-médias et cinéma à lâge hypermoderne he analyses a second modern revolution declaring the end of post modernism arguing that paradoxes are multiplying due to the complexity of modern life. His 2013 book Lesthétisation du monde vivre à lâge du capitalisme artiste focuses on capitalism and its relationship to art especially the cinema.

Lipovetsky has made provocative statements on modern life and elements related to it which have been often at odds with intellectual trends of the last decades. He has compared fashion with democracy as unstable ephemeral and superficial but states it as a positive and more workable then a more interdependent society. He states that the focus of modern life is the new which then quickly becomes old and we look for something else leading to his notion of hyper as this need for new becomes faster in the age of Internet and social media which also breaks down traditional institutions such as nation and family. Even culture succumbs to this according to him as people go to museums more as tourists rather than for education. The need for new triggers hyper-consumerism with people trying to keep up with trends and creating frustration among the poorer who cannot keep up. However he makes a distinction between hyper-consumerism and consumerism. He does not criticize the latter which he says has had positives in rising living standards. He believes that consumption should be a means to an end not an end in itself and believes that concerns such as ecology are not incompatible with capitalism.

Lipovetsky does not have a well-defined style of presentation varying among manners of speaking similar to that of psychologist or sociologist as well as philosopher often gesturing emphatically. His methodology varies as well often dealing in paradoxes. His approach to issues is almost nonexistent epistemologically. There is also strong influence in his writing from French literature although he does not write fiction."
Émile Littré,"Littré was born in Paris. His father Michel-François Littré had been a gunner and later a sergeant-major of marine artillery in the French navy who was deeply imbued with revolutionary ideas of the day. Settling down as a tax collector he married Sophie Johannot a free-thinker like himself and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand where Louis Hachette and Eugène Burnouf became his friends. After he completed his studies at the lycée he was undecided as to what career he should adopt; however he devoted himself to mastering the English and German languages classical and Sanskrit literature and philology.

He finally decided to become a student of medicine in 1822. He passed all his examinations in due course and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as doctor when in 1827 his father died leaving his mother without means. He abandoned his degree at once despite his keen interest in medicine and while attending lectures by Pierre Rayer began teaching Latin and Greek to earn a living. He served as a soldier for the populists during the July Revolution of 1830 and was one of the members of the National Guard who followed Charles X to Rambouillet. In 1831 he obtained an introduction to Armand Carrel the editor of Le National who gave him the task of reading English and German papers for excerpts. By chance in 1835 Carrel discovered Littrés skills as a writer and from that time on he was a constant contributor to the journal eventually becoming its director.

In 1836 Littré began to contribute articles on a wide range of subjects to the Revue des deux mondes and in 1837 he married. In 1839 the first volume of his complete works of Hippocrates appeared in print. Due to the outstanding quality of this work he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in the same year. He noticed the works of Auguste Comte the reading of which formed as he himself said the cardinal point of his life. From this time forward the influence of positivism affected his own life and what is of more importance he influenced positivism giving as much to this philosophy as he received from it. He soon became a friend of Comte and popularised his ideas in numerous works on the positivist philosophy. He continued translating and publishing his edition of Hippocrates writings which was not completed until 1862 and he published a similar edition of Plinys Natural History. After 1844 he took Fauriels place on the committee engaged to produce the Histoire littéraire de la France where his knowledge of the early French language and literature was invaluable.

Littré started work on his great Dictionnaire de la langue française in about 1844 which was not to be completed until thirty years later. He participated in the revolution of July 1848 and in the repression of the extreme Republican Party in June 1849. His essays contributed during this period to the National were collected together and published under the title of Conservation revolution et positivisme in 1852 and show a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte. However during the later years of his masters life he began to perceive that he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend and master. He concealed his differences of opinion and Comte failed to recognise that his pupil had outgrown him as he himself had outgrown his master Henri de Saint-Simon.

Comtes death in 1858 freed Littré from any fear of alienating his master. He published his own ideas in his Paroles de la philosophie positive in 1859. Four years later in a work of greater length he published Auguste Comte et la philosophie positive which traces the origin of Comtes ideas through Turgot Kant and Saint-Simon. The work eulogises Comtes own life his method of philosophy his great services to the cause and the effect of his works and proceeds to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comtes philosophy his great laws of society and his philosophical method which indeed he defended warmly against John Stuart Mill. However he stated that while he believed in a positivist philosophy he did not believe in a religion of humanity.

About 1863 after completing his translations of Hippocrates and his Pliny he began work in earnest on his great French dictionary. He was invited to join the Académie française but declined not wishing to associate himself with Félix Dupanloup bishop of Orléans who had denounced him as the head of the French materialists in his Avertissement aux pères de famille. At this time he also started La Revue de philosophie positive with Grégoire Wyrouboff a magazine that embodied the views of modern positivists.

Thus his life was absorbed in literary work until the events that overthrew the Second Empire called him to take a part in politics. He felt himself too old to undergo the privations of the Siege of Paris and retired with his family to Brittany. He was summoned by Gambetta to Bordeaux to lecture on history and thence to Versailles to take his seat in the senate to which he had been chosen by the département of the Seine. In December 1871 he was elected a member of the Académie française in spite of the renewed opposition of Msgr. Dupanloup who resigned his seat rather than receive him.

Littrés Dictionnaire de la langue française was completed in 1873 after nearly 30 years of work. The draft was written on 415636 sheets bundled in packets of one thousand stored in eight white wooden crates that filled the cellar of Littrés home in Mesnil-le-Roi. The landmark effort gave authoritative definitions and usage descriptions to every word based on the various meanings it had held in the past. When it was published by Hachette it was the largest lexicographical work on the French language at that time.

In 1874 Littré was elected Senator for life of the Third Republic. His most notable writings during these years were his political papers that attacked and revealed the confederacy of the Orléanists and Legitimists against the Republic; his re-editions of many of his old articles and books among others the Conservation révolution et positivisme of 1852 ; and a little tract Pour la dernière fois in which he maintained his unalterable belief in the philosophy of Materialism.

A wise man of ancient times who was asked the same question by a king thought about an answer for days but was never able to answer. I please you not to request an answer from me. No science denies a first cause because it finds neither another warrant nor proof. All knowledge is relative and we always meet unknown phenomena and laws we dont know its cause. The one who proclaims with determination to neither believe nor disbelieve in a God proofs not to understand the problem of what makes things exist and disappear.

When it became obvious that the old man would not live much longer his wife and daughter who had always been fervent Catholics strove to convert him to their religion. He had long discussions with Father Louis Millériot a celebrated Controversialist and Abbé Henri Huvelin the noted priest of Église Saint-Augustin who were much grieved at his death. When Littré was near death he converted was baptised by the abbé and his funeral was conducted with the rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Littré is interred at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris."
Peter Lombard,"Peter Lombard was a scholastic theologian Bishop of Paris and author of Four Books of Sentences which became the standard textbook of theology for which he earned the accolade Magister Sententiarum.

Peter Lombard was born in Lumellogno in northwestern Italy to a poor family. His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100.

His education most likely began in Italy at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca. The patronage of Odo bishop of Lucca who recommended him to Bernard of Clairvaux allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris. Lombard studied first in the cathedral school at Reims where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching and arrived in Paris about 1134 where Bernard recommended him to the canons of the church of St. Victor.

In Paris where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of Notre Dame he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor who were among the leading theologians of the time. There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142 when he became recognized as writer and teacher. Around 1145 Peter became a magister or professor at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. Peters means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his canons prebend is shrouded in uncertainty.

Lombards style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a celebrated theologian by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame to a man were members of the Capetian dynasty relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage scions of the Île-de-France or eastern Loire Valley nobility or relatives of royal officials. In contrast Peter had no relatives ecclesiastical connections and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit.

He became a subdeacon in 1147. Possibly he was present at the consistory of Paris in 1147 and certainly he attended the Council of Reims in 1148 where Pope Eugenius III was present at the synod which examined Gilbert de la Porrée and Éon de lÉtoile. Peter was among the signers of the act condemning Gilberts teachings. At some time after 1150 he became a deacon then an archdeacon maybe as early as 1152. He was ordained priest some time before 1156. On 28 July 1159 at the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul he was consecrated as bishop of Paris. Walter of St Victor accused Peter of obtaining the office by simony. The more usual story is that Philip younger brother of Louis VII and archdeacon of Notre-Dame was elected by the canons but declined in favor of Peter his teacher.

His reign as bishop was brief. He died on either 21 or 22 July 1160. Little can be ascertained about Lombards administrative style or objectives because he left behind so few episcopal acta. He was succeeded by Maurice de Sully the builder of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. His tomb in the church of Saint-Marcel in Paris was destroyed during the French Revolution but a transcription of his epitaph survives.

Peter Lombard wrote commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline epistles; however his most famous work by far was Libri Quatuor Sententiarum or the Four Books of Sentences which became the standard textbook of theology at the medieval universities. From the 1220s until the 16th century no work of Christian literature except for the Bible itself was commented upon more frequently. All the major medieval thinkers from Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas to William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel were influenced by it. Even the young Martin Luther still wrote glosses on the Sentences and John Calvin quoted from it over 100 times in his Institutes.

Though the Four Books of Sentences formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Christian dogma was based rather than a dialectical work itself the Four Books of Sentences is a compilation of biblical texts together with relevant passages from the Church Fathers and many medieval thinkers on virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time. Peter Lombards magnum opus stands squarely within the pre-scholastic exegesis of biblical passages in the tradition of Anselm of Laon who taught through quotations from authorities. It stands out as the first major effort to bring together commentaries on the full range of theological issues arrange the material in a systematic order and attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different viewpoints. The Sentences starts with the Trinity in Book I moves on to creation in Book II treats Christ the saviour of the fallen creation in Book III and deals with the sacraments which mediate Christs grace in Book IV.

Peter Lombards most famous and most controversial doctrine in the Sentences was his identification of charity with the Holy Spirit in Book I distinction 17. According to this doctrine when the Christian loves God and his neighbour this love literally is God; he becomes divine and is taken up into the life of the Trinity. This idea in its inchoate form can be extrapolated from certain remarks of St. Augustine of Hippo . Although this was never declared unorthodox few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter Lombard in this aspect of his teaching. Compare Pope Benedict XVIs encyclical Deus caritas est 2006.

Also in the Sentences was the doctrine that marriage was consensual and need not be consummated to be considered perfect unlike Gratians analysis . Lombards interpretation was later endorsed by Pope Alexander III and had a significant impact on Church interpretation of marriage. He emphasized the reciprocal consent of the parties is sufficiently constitutive of an absolutely indissoluble marriage and is its only cause independent of sexual intercourse."
Frédéric Lordon,"Frédéric Lordon is a French economist and philosopherCNRS Director of Research at the Centre européen de sociologie et de science politique in Paris.He is an influential figure in Frances Nuit debout movement.

Lordon studied at the École nationale des Ponts et Chaussées and received his degree there in 1985. He graduated from the Institut Supérieur des Affaires in 1987.

Lordon teaches at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris.

He has served since 2004 as a Director of Research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research .

Lordons work is an attempt to integrate Spinozas concepts such as conatus into the study of political economy. As a participant in the current crises of capitalism he debates publicly in France proposing ostensible solutions.

Lordon played an instrumental role in the rise of the Nuit debout movement. He wrote a piece in the February 2016 issue of Le Monde diplomatique on François Ruffins film Merci patron describing the film as a clarion call for a potential uprising.

Stéphane Lupasco,"Stéphane Lupasco was a Romanian philosopher who developed non-Aristotelian logic.

Stéphane Lupasco was born in Bucharest on 11 August 1900. His family belonged to the old Moldavian aristocracy. His father was a lawyer and politician but it was his mother a pianist and student of César Franck who established the family in Paris in 1916. After high school at the Lycée Buffon he studied philosophy biology and physics at the Sorbonne and briefly law. He participated fully in the artistic and intellectual life of Paris in the 20s and 30s and defended his State Doctoral Thesis in 1935.

In 1946 he was named Research Assistant at the French National Science Research Centre a post he was obliged to leave ten years later because of the inability of the Centre to decide in which Scientific Section his work belonged The next ten or fifteen years were those of greatest acceptance of his work by the public and other thinkers but unfortunately not by mainstream logicians and philosophers. His Trois Matières published in 1960 was a bestseller and people began calling Lupasco the Descartes the Leibniz the Hegel of the 20th Century a new Claude Bernard a new Bergson etc. He continued to publish books in the 70s and 80s the last being LHomme et ses Trois Éthiques in 1986 two years before his death on October 7 1988 in Paris. An Award of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984 was among the few honors that came to Lupasco during his lifetime. Lupasco was one of the founding members of the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research founded in Paris in 1987 by Basarab Nicolescu Edgar Morin René Berger Michel Random and other key figures of the French intelligentsia. As Nicolescu has recalled Lupasco was deeply affected by the stubborn resistance of the academic community to honest debate and discussion of his new principles and postulates and it is with an understandable bitterness that Lupasco saw in this resistance another example of the operation of his principles.

Lupascos style as an author is not an easy one and requires the uninterrupted attention of the reader. It is not infrequent to find sentences of almost a page in length containing multiple nested clauses. His writing is extremely dense in terms of the ideas and meaning of each successive phrase with only occasional illustrative examples. Lupasco makes many references to his prior publications unfortunately often without adequate indexation. As Nicolescu has remarked Lupascos exclusion from French academic life had both advantages and disadvantages Lupasco was freed from the constraints of teaching and publication of research papers in a rigid format and he obviously did not find it necessary to apply the discipline of providing references to his sources. In the Psychic Universe published when Lupasco was seventy-nine one sees nothing about current work in psychiatry. A recent study by Brenner up-dates Lupascos work and shows its relevance to current issues in science and philosophy as well as logic.

Lupasco was not well served by the exegetes that had looked closely at his work. Only one book by the sociologist Marc Beigbeder presents both a substantial description of Lupascos theory and development of it as a logic of society. A brief monograph by the philosopher Benjamin Fondane dating from 1944 and published in 1998 discusses the limitations of Lupascos view of affectivity and ontology. A book by an obscure English artist George Melhuish uses Lupascos ideas to develop his own concept of the structure of the universe a sympathetic but not very rigorous reading of his work. Aside from Nicolescus personal library it has been claimed that access to these and several other texts are otherwise unavailable. A complete understanding of for example Lupascos analysis of those precursors that André Glucksmann has called Les Maîtres Penseurs Kant Hegel Schopenhauer and Marx must be sought in several different books. The attention of the reader is rewarded however by Lupascos regular restatements of his basic theses often in a way that is more economic meaningful and coherent.

In his introduction to Lupascos The Principle of Antagonism and the Logic of Energy Nicolescu points out that once the reader gets beyond the mathematical formulas in this book Lupascos language is perfectly accessible. It exemplifies in a self-referential manner the ternary aspects of actualization potentialization and included middle which give it the charm and the privilege of incantations that are at the same time scientific philosophical and poetic.

Summarizing briefly stimulated by Albert Einsteins works and quantum theory Lupasco founded a new logic questioning the tertium non datur principle of classical logic. He introduced a third state going beyond the duality principle the T-state. The T-state is neither actual nor potential but a resolution of the two contradictory elements at a higher level of reality or complexity. Lupasco generalised his logic to physics and epistemology and above all to a new theory of consciousness.

A key reference in French is the compendium of 1999 Stéphane Lupasco -The Man and the Work by H. Badescu and B. Nicolescu. The first comprehensive update and comparison of Lupascos thought in English is the 2008 book by J. E. Brenner Logic in Reality. Other useful new references are the combined papers of a Symposium on Lupasco in 2009 At the Confluence of Two Cultures Lupasco Today in French and a biographical paper by Brenner The Philosophical Logic of Stéphane Lupasco in English."
Jean-François Lyotard,"Jean-François Lyotard was a French philosopher sociologist and literary theorist. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as epistemology and communication the human body modern art and postmodern art literature and critical theory music film time and memory space the city and landscape the sublime and the relation between aesthetics and politics. He is best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of postmodernity on the human condition. Lyotard was a key personality in contemporary Continental philosophy and author of 26 books and many articles. He was a director of the International College of Philosophy founded by Jacques Derrida François Châtelet Jean-Pierre Faye and Dominique Lecourt.

Jean François Lyotard was born on August 10 1924 in Vincennes France to Jean-Pierre Lyotard a sales representative and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to school at the Lycée Buffon and Louis-le-Grand Paris. As a child Lyotard had many aspirations to be an artist a historian a Dominican friar and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15. Ultimately Lyotard described the realization that he would not become any of these occupations as fate in his intellectual biography called Peregrinations published in 1988.

Lyotard served as a medic during the liberation of Paris in the Second World War and soon after began studying philosophy at the Sorbonne in the late 1940s after failing the entrance exam to the more prestigious École normale supérieure twice. His 1947 DES thesisIndifference as an Ethical Concept analyzed forms of indifference and detachment in Zen Buddhism Stoicism Taoism and Epicureanism. In 1950 Lyotard took up a position teaching philosophy in Constantine in French Algeria but returned to mainland France in 1952 to teach at the Prytanée military academy in La Flèche where he wrote a short work on Phenomenology published in 1954. Lyotard moved to Paris in 1959 to teach at the Sorbonne introductory lectures from this time have been posthumously published under the title Why Philosophize Having moved to teach at the new campus of Nanterre in 1966 Lyotard participated in the events following March 22 and the tumult of May 1968. In 1971 Lyotard earned a State doctorate with his dissertation Discours figure under Mikel Dufrennethe work was published the same year. Lyotard joined the Philosophy department of the experimental University at Vincennes later Paris 8 together with Gilles Deleuze in the academic year 1970-71; it remained his academic home in France until 1987. He married his first wife Andrée May in 1948 with whom he had two children Corinne and Laurence and later married for a second time in 1993 to Dolores Djidzek the mother of his son David .

In 1954 Lyotard became a member of Socialisme ou Barbarie a French political organisation formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the Trotskyist analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the Soviet Union. Socialisme ou Barbarie and the publication of the same name had an objective to conduct a critique of Marxism from within the left including the dominance of bureaucrary within the French Communist Party and its adherence to the dictats of the Soviet Union. His writings in this period are mostly concerned with far-left politics with a focus on the Algerian situationwhich he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine. As the principle correspondent on Algeria for Socialisme ou Barbarie during the period of Algerias struggle for independence Lyotard wrote a dozen essays analysing the economic and political situation which were later reproduced in La Guerre des Algeriens and translated in Political Writings . Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France and a social revolution actively supporting the FLN in secret whilst also being critical of its approach. Following disputes with Cornelius Castoriadis in 1964 Lyotard left Socialisme ou Barbarie for the newly formed splinter group Pouvoir Ouvrier from which he resigned in turn in 1966. Although Lyotard played an active part in the May 1968 uprisings he distanced himself from revolutionary Marxism with his 1974 book Libidinal Economy. He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid structuralist approach and they were imposing systematization of desires through strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.

Lyotard taught at the Lycée of Constantine Algeria from 1950 to 1952. In 1952 Lyotard returned to mainland France to teach at the Prytanée military academy La Flèche Sarthe. He published the book La phénoménologie in 1954 and began to write for the journal Socialisme ou Barbarie under the psudonym François Laborde. In 1972 Lyotard began teaching at the University of Paris VIII; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. In 1982-3 Lyotard was involved in the foundation of the Collège International de Philosophie Paris serving as its second Director in 1985. Lyotard frequently lectured outside France as visiting professor at universities around the world. From 1974 these included trans-atlantic visits including Johns Hopkins University University of California Berkeley Yale University Stony Brook University and the University of California San Diego in the U.S. the Université de Montréal in Quebec and the University of São Paulo in Brazil. In 1987 he took a part-time professorship at the University of California Irvine where he held a joint post with Jacques Derrida and Wolfgang Iser in the Department of Critical Theory. Before his death he split his time between Paris and Atlanta where he taught at Emory University as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French from 1995-8.

Lyotards work is characterised by a persistent opposition to universals métarécits and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the universalist claims of the Enlightenment and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.

In his writings of the early 1970s he rejects what he regards as theological underpinnings of both Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud In Freud it is judaical critical sombre ; in Marx it is catholic. Hegelian reconciliatory in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation Here a politics there a therapeutics in both cases a laical theology on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces. Consequently he rejected Theodor W. Adornos negative dialectics because he viewed them as seeking a therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion here the religion of history. In Lyotards libidinal economics he aimed at discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities.

Throughout his academic career Jean-François Lyotard has contributed to the magazines LÂge nouveau Les Temps modernes Socialisme ou barbarie Cahiers de philosophie Esprit Revue desthétique Musique en jeu LArt vivant Semiotexte October Art Press International Critique Flash Art Art Forum Posie among others.

Lyotard is a skeptic for modern cultural thought. According to his 1979 The Postmodern Condition A Report on Knowledge the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke skepticism about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that we have outgrown our needs for metanarratives due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since World War II. He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices such as science and culture; according to James Williams for Lyotard the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust. A loss of faith in metanarratives has an effect on how we view science art and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining social transformations and political problems. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade science suffers a loss of faith in its search for truth and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for information machines. Lyotard argues that one day in order for knowledge to be considered useful it will have to be converted into computerized data. Years later this led him into writing his book The Inhuman published in 1988 in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.

In his book The Inhuman Lyotard explores the philosophy of Kant Heidegger Adorno and Derrida as well as the works of modernist and postmodernist artists like Cézanne Debussy and Boulez in a wide-ranging debate. Time and memory the sublime and the avant-garde and the link between aesthetics and politics are all topics Lyotard addresses in the book. He analyzes the close but problematic ties between modernity development and humanity as well as the shift to postmodernity throughout his study. The job of literature philosophy and the arts according to Lyotard is to give witness to and explain this arduous shift.

Lyotard rejected classical humanism mainly because he paradoxically assumes that the humane is something that every person has inherently from birth but can only be realized through an education. Lyotard essentially asks if humanity is so inherent to all of us can we only gain it by undergoing education By using the concept of the inhuman Lyotard described all those things that humanism has excluded from its definition of man.

He developed a science fiction thought experiment that would take place in 4.5 billion years at the time of the explosion of the sun. Should the human species put itself in the position to live on without Earth and if so what would then remain of humanity Everything that is of importance for our present determination of what is human would fall away if the human species began living an extra-planetary existence. Lyotards opinion on this remained divided on the one hand he criticized the dehumanizing effects of modern technology that can already be observed today; on the other hand he saw in them the chance to open up a space of possibilities since they do not fix the human being to one image.

Most famously in La Condition postmoderne Rapport sur le savoir he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the postmodern as an incredulity towards meta-narratives. These meta-narrativessometimes grand narrativesare grand large-scale theories and philosophies of the world such as the progress of history the knowability of everything by science and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that we have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain us all. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what if anything was real and everyone had their own perspective and story. We have become alert to difference diversity the incompatibility of our aspirations beliefs and desires and for that reason postmodernity is characterised by an abundance of micronarratives. For this concept Lyotard draws from the notion of language-games found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.

In Lyotards works the term language games sometimes also called phrase regimens denotes the multiplicity of communities of meaning the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created. This involves for example an incredulity towards the metanarrative of human emancipation. That is the story of how the human race has set itself free that brings together the language game of science the language game of human historical conflicts and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral well-being. According to this metanarrative the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as a steady progress towards civilization or moral well-being. The language game of human passions qualities and faults is seen as steadily shifting in favor of our qualities and away from our faults as science and historical developments help us to conquer our faults in favor of our qualities. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example for any new social political or scientific revolution we could ask the question Is this revolution a step towards the greater well-being of the mass of human beings It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.

This becomes more crucial in Au juste Conversations and Le Différend which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomisation of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement thou shalt not steal is an ethical statement in a way that thou shalt not steal from Margaret is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement ; it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement . But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one phrase regimen and apply them to another. Ethical behaviour is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the differend. In a differend there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties is the first step towards finding a solution.

In more than one book Lyotard promoted what he called a new paganism. Plato in Book II of the Republic condemns pagans for their shape-shifting and deceitful gods antithetical to universal truth. Lyotard prefers a mirror image of Platos critique vindicating the pagans as Plato sees them. A new paganism would revolt against Greek masculinism such as that of Plato. The revolt would be led by women for woman is antirational and antiphilosophical . Woman as the little girl is the antonym of the adult male questioner and would release us from the mental illness evident in Platonic philosophy in Judaism and in the American French and Russian revolutions.

In The Differend based on Immanuel Kants views on the separation of Understanding Judgment and Reason Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend and explains it as follows ...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence . Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to . The meaning of a phrasean event --cannot be fixed by appealing to reality . Lyotard develops this view of language by defining reality in an original way as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality since the referent itself does not fix sense and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore the phrase event remains indeterminate.

Lyotard uses the example of Auschwitz and the revisionist historian Robert Faurissons demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a double bind. Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence or there were gas chambers in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers except the testimony of actual victims he will conclude from both possibilities that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives either there were gas chambers or there were not which lead to the same conclusion there were no gas chambers . The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgement upheld by Faurisson.

Lyotard was a frequent writer on aesthetic matters. He was despite his reputation as a postmodernist a great promoter of modernist art. Lyotard saw postmodernism as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favoured the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of our conceptuality a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice Valerio Adami Daniel Buren Marcel Duchamp Jacques Monory Ruth Francken Shusaku Arakawa Bracha Ettinger Sam Francis Karel Appel Barnett Newman René Guiffrey Gianfranco Baruchello and Albert Ayme as well as on earlier artists notably Paul Cézanne and Paul Klee.

He developed these themes in particular by discussing the sublime. The sublime is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that we experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like for example a massive craggy mountain black against the sky looming terrifyingly in our vision. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings which makes it harder for us to see the injustice of it or a solution to it.

Lyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment . In this book Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms there are two kinds of sublime experience. In the mathematically sublime an object strikes the mind in such a way that we find ourselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely we experience a clash between our reason and the imagination . In the dynamically sublime the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than we whose weight force scale could crush us without the remotest hope of our being able to resist it. This explains the feeling of anxiety.

What is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words what we are able to make ourselves see cannot fully match up to what we know is there. We know it is a mountain but we cannot take the whole thing into our perception. Our sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights but our reason can assert the finitude of the presentation. With the dynamically sublime our sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that we are not just physical material beings but moral and noumenal beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but our reason need not be. This explains in both cases why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain.

Lyotard is fascinated by this admission from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment that the mind cannot always organise the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard in Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime but drawing on his argument in The Differend this is a good thing. Such generalities as concepts fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where we realise the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What we are witnessing says Lyotard is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality.

Lyotards thesis published under the title Discours Figure focused on aesthetics. Lyotard devoted himself a lot to aesthetic issues in a way that sought to break with the Hegelian perspective in which art had to think of itself as a materialization of the mind.

Lyotards thought on modern and contemporary art focused on a few artists who allowed him to emphasize the flagship issues of French thought after the Second World War particularly those of conceptual mastery of the artist as an author Paul Cézanne and Wassily Kandinsky as well as Bracha L. Ettinger Albert Ayme Daniel Buren Marcel Duchamp Valerio Adami Jacques Monory Shusaku Arakawa Ruth Francken Sam Francis Barnett Newman Joseph Kosuth Karel Appel René Guiffrey and Gianfranco Baruchello.

In one of Lyotards most famous books Libidinal Economy he offers a critique of Marxs idea of false consciousness and claims that the 19th-century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this was due to libidinal energythe term libidinal coming from the term libido used in psychoanalysis to refer to the desires of our deeper consciousness. Libidinal Economy has been called an achievement in our attempts to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it. Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires force us away from set structures. However there also can be no intensities or desires without structures because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment. This was the first of Lyotards writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success but was also the last of Lyotards writings on this particular topic where he really opposed the views of Marx.

In 1985 Lyotard co-curated the exhibition Les Immatériaux at the Centre de Création Industrielle at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris together with the design theorist and curator Thierry Chaput. At that point Les Immatériaux was the largest exhibition held at the Centre Georges Pompidou. The exhibition was framed in a pre-1989 context that predicted globalization to be a melancholy foreshadowing of contemporary arts shifting function in the era of increasing transnational exchange and as a turning point in a history of exhibits in the aftermath of what was formerly known as aesthetics. 

John Rajchman says this about the exhibition We might imagine Les Immatériaux as an extravagant staging of a peculiar moment in the role of information in the history of aesthetics after so-called modernism yet before the contemporary configuration of biennials that was already taking shape in the 1990s within or against which the question of a new history of exhibition now itself arises.

Lyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity as opposed to the settled hubris of maturity. In Mainmise however he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the concept of mancipium an authoritative right of possession. Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate them let alone oppose them Lyotard considered that We are born from others but also to others given over defenceless to them. Subject to their mancipium.

Some of the latest works that Lyotard had been working on were both writings about a French writer activist and politician André Malraux. One of them being a biography Signed Malraux. Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Lyotards other book was named The Confession of Augustine and was a study in the phenomenology of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotards death.

Lyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as The Postmodern Explained to Children Toward the Postmodern and Postmodern Fables. In 1998 while preparing for a conference on postmodernism and media theory he died unexpectedly from a case of leukemia that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

There are three major criticisms of Lyotards work. Each coincides with a school of thought. Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy have written deconstructions of Lyotards work . They focus on Lyotards postmodern work and on The Differend in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of language games and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups In concentrating on specific differences Lyotards thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction Lyotards philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any differend there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.

Manfred Frank has put the Frankfurt School criticism best. It attacks Lyotards search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a performative contradiction to give an account that appeals to our reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice and differ ends. Worse he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice rather than put forward a just and rational resolution. In turn these criticisms have been met with responses arguing that Frank misreads Lyotards work for example failing to recognize the role of the sublime as well as failing to see that Lyotard wants to go beyond the monopoly of the cognitive argumentative genre in order to give other genres a right to exist as well.

From a Nietzschean and Deleuzian point of view Lyotards postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern nihilism that his early work avoids. The different and the sublime are negative terms that introduce a severe pessimism at the core of Lyotards philosophy. Both terms draw lines that cannot be crossed and yet they mark the threshold of that which is most valuable for the philosophy that which is to be testified to and its proper concern. It is not possible repetitively to lend an ear to the sublime without falling into despair due to its fleeting nature. Whenever we try to understand or even memorize the activity of testimony through the sublime it can only be as something that has now dissipated and that we cannot capture.

Charles J. Stivale reviewed Lyotards The Differend in 1990 stating

Jean-François Lyotards is a dense work of philosophical political and ethical reflection aimed at a specialized audience versed in current debates in logic pragmatics and post-structuralism. Even George Van Den Abbeeles excellent translation complete with a glossary of French terms not available in the original text does not indeed cannot alleviate the often terse prose with which Lyotard develops his reasoning. With this said I must also observe that this work is of vital importance in a period when revisionism of all stripes attempts to rewrite and often simply deny the occurrence of historical and cultural events i.e. in attempting to reconstruct reality in the convenient names of truth and common sense This overview must leave unexplored the broad philosophical bases from which Lyotard draws support as well as important questions that he raises regarding history justice and critical judgement. I can conclude only by suggesting that this work despite the formidable difficulties inherent to its carefully articulated arguments offers readers a rich formulation of precise questions for and about the current period of critical transition and re-opening in philosophy ethics and aesthetics.

The collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Collège International de Philosophie and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and Jean-Claude Milner the Colleges director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title Jean-François Lyotard lexercice du différend.

Lyotards work continues to be important in politics philosophy sociology literature art and cultural studies. To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotards death an international symposium about Jean-François Lyotard organized by the Collège International de Philosophie was held in Paris from January 2527 in 2007."
Gabriel Bonnot de Mably,"Gabriel Bonnot de Mably sometimes known as Abbé de Mably was a French philosopher historian and writer who for a short time served in the diplomatic corps. He was a popular 18th-century writer.

Gabriel Bonnot was born at Mably Loire into a family that belonged to the Noblesse de robe or Nobles of the Robe. This class formed the Second Estate whose rank derived from holding judicial or administrative posts and were often hard-working professionals unlike the aristocratic Noblesse dépée or Nobles of the Sword. He and his older brother Jean added de Mably to their names; his younger brother Étienne used another family property at Condillac Drôme. As Condillac he also became a noted writer and philosopher.

Gabriel and his brothers were educated in an institution run by the Society of Jesus or Jesuits; he enrolled in a seminary at Saint-Sulpice. In 1742 he became a confidant of Cardinal Tencin then Minister of State without Portfolio for whom he carried out various diplomatic roles during the 1740 to 1748 War of the Austrian Succession. They included negotiating an alliance with Prussia in 1743 and preparing terms for the 1746 Congress of Breda which sought to agree a separate peace with Britain. However he fell out with Cardinal Tencin and thereafter focused on scholarly pursuits.

Based on the recommendation of Françoise-Louise de Warens in April 1740 Mablys older brother Jean employed the 28-year-old Jean-Jacques Rousseau as tutor for his two oldest sons. Rousseau produced two short works addressed to Jean de Mably Memorandum Presented to Monsieur de Mably on the Education of Monsieur His Son and the shorter Plan for the Education of Monsieur de Sainte-Marie. These outline a proposed system of education for Jean de Mablys sons and also present one of his earliest public self-reflections and self-justifications. By summer 1741 Rousseau realized he was ill-suited to the position and the two agreed to end his employment parting on friendly terms.

The historian Leo Damrosch explains that at this time Abbé de Mably

Rousseau would remain lifelong friends with Mably and his family. Both Mably and his brother Condillac visited Rousseau when he moved to Montmorency Val-dOise. Rousseau later reflected upon his experience tutoring Jean de Mablys sons in The Confessions.

In 1909 the anarchist Peter Kropotkin credited Mably several achievements he is credited with being responsible for why the study of politics constitutions and elective representation in the 18th century was so popular with inspiring the egalitarian communal and anti-inequality ethos of the French Revolution and for being an early advocate of communist or communal possession of the land.

Mablys most well-known work is Entretiens de Phocion a dialogue first published in 1763 which introduced themes of his mature thought. Two of his works were published posthumously and they had a profound effect on the early deliberations on the assembly of the Estates-General of 1789 an enlarged version of his Histoire de France which was published in May 1789 to great acclaim. Authorities tried unsuccessfully to suppress it by confiscating many copies. Secondly Des droits et des devoirs du citoyen written in 1758 was also published after his death. He warned against events that later developed during the French Revolution.

These two works were seen to contribute to the later concepts of both communism and republicanism. He advocated the abolition of private property which he saw as incompatible with sympathy and altruism and conductive only to ones antisocial or egotistical instincts. Mablys writings contain a paradox he praises elitist Plato but also the enlightened Stoic views on natural human equality. Mably went further than the traditional Stoic argument that all men possessed a divine spark. He also went beyond the liberal concept of equality before the law and argued for the equality of needs. He argued that virtue was more valued than the acquisition or possession of material wealth and criticized idleness. He found an audience among those who were critical of the inherited wealth and privilege of the nobility who did no work.

Mablys complete works were published in 15 volumes in 17941795 with an obituarybiography by Gabriel Brizard.

Pierre Macherey,"Pierre Macherey is a French Marxist literary critic at the University of Lille Nord de France. A former student of Louis Althusser and collaborator on the influential volume Reading Capital Macherey is a central figure in the development of French post-structuralism and Marxism. His work is influential in literary theory and Continental philosophy in Europe though it is generally little read in the United States.

Macherey is known for his contribution to Reading Capital his influential work in Marxist literary criticism and intensive philosophical engagement with both Spinoza and Hegel. His work on these figures complicates a relationship that is often otherwise taken to be a simple opposition between the competing paradigms of immanance and dialectics. For Macherey as Jason Read puts it the task is not to choose between Team Hegel and Team Spinoza but to interrogate each by means of the other.

Since October 2000 he has been engaged in a group project entitled La Philosophie au sens large which has been hosted on the academic web platform Hypotheses.org since 2009. The project collects essays presentations and longer form studies that highlight the interrelation between philosophy and the literary political artistic and social scientific thought that conditions it. The project is described as an attempt to reformulate the problematic of practice. In this context Macherey has described philosophy in the grand sense as a conjunctural practice which has no other means of surpassing the limits imposed by the conjunctures with which it is confronted other than to reflect on them and to elucidate their conditions in such a way as to eventually be able to intervene with regard to them and therefore to contribute to the transformation or evolution of these conjunctures.

Only a partial selection of Machereys work has been translated into English."
Catherine Malabou,"Catherine Malabou is a French philosopher. She is a Professor in the Philosophy Department at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University at the European Graduate School and in the department of Comparative Literature at the University of California Irvine a position formerly held by Jacques Derrida.

Malabou graduated from the École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines . Her agrégation and doctorate were obtained under the supervision of Jacques Derrida from the École des hautes études en sciences sociales. Her dissertation became the book LAvenir de Hegel Plasticité Temporalité Dialectique .

Central to Malabous philosophy is the concept of plasticity which she derives in part from the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and from medical science for example from work on stem cells and from the concept of neuroplasticity. In 1999 Malabou published Voyager avec Jacques Derrida La Contre-allée co-authored with Derrida. Her book Les nouveaux blessés concerns the intersection between neuroscience psychoanalysis and philosophy thought through the phenomenon of trauma.

Coinciding with her exploration of neuroscience has been an increasing commitment to political philosophy. This is first evident in her book What Should We Do With Our Brain and continues in Les nouveaux blessés as well as in her book on feminism and in her forthcoming book about the homeless and social emergency .

Malabou is co-writing a book with Adrian Johnston on affects in Descartes Spinoza and neuroscience and is preparing a new book on the political meaning of life in the light of the most recent biological discoveries . The latter work will discuss Giorgio Agambens concept of bare life and Michel Foucaults notion of biopower underscoring the lack of scientific biological definitions of these terms and the political meaning of such a lack."
Nicolas Malebranche,"Nicolas Malebranche Oratory of Jesus was a French OratorianCatholic priest and rationalist philosopher. In his works he sought to synthesize the thought of St. Augustine and Descartes in order to demonstrate the active role of God in every aspect of the world. Malebranche is best known for his doctrines of vision in God occasionalism and ontologism.

Malebranche was born in Paris in 1638 the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche secretary to King Louis XIII of France and Catherine de Lauzon sister of Jean de Lauson a Governor of New France. Because of a malformed spine Malebranche received his elementary education from a private tutor. He left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the Collège de la Marche and subsequently to study theology at the Collège de Sorbonne both colleges from the University of Paris. He eventually left the Sorbonne having rejected scholasticism and entered the Oratory in 1660. There he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history linguistics the Bible and the works of Saint Augustine. Malebranche was ordained a priest in 1664.

In 1664 Malebranche first read Descartes Treatise on Man an account of the physiology of the human body. Malebranches biographer Father Yves André reported that Malebranche was influenced by Descartes book because it allowed him to view the natural world without Aristotelian scholasticism. Malebranche spent the next decade studying Cartesianism.

In 167475 Malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work. Entitled Concerning the Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences the book laid the foundation for Malebranches philosophical reputation and ideas. It dealt with the causes of human error and on how to avoid such mistakes. Most importantly in the third book which discussed pure understanding he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in God.

Malebranches first critic was the Abbé Simon Foucher who attacked the Search even before its second volume had been published. Malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume and then in the 1678 third edition he added 50 to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of seventeen Elucidations. These responded to further criticisms but they also expanded on the original arguments and developed them in new ways. In the Tenth Elucidation for instance Malebranche introduced his theory of intelligible extension a single archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved. In others Malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation and particularly on his contention that God acted for the most part through general volitions and only rarely as in the case of miracles through particular volitions.

Malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published Treatise on Nature and Grace. Here he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby God regulated His behaviour extended not only to His activity in the natural world but also applied to His gift of grace to human beings. The book was attacked by fellow Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld and although Arnaulds initial concerns were theological ones the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems. Over the next few years the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of Malebranches collected works and three of Arnaulds. Arnaulds supporters managed to persuade the Roman Catholic Church to place Nature and Grace on its Index of Prohibited Books in 1690 and it was followed there by the Search nineteen years later. Other critics with whom Malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow Cartesian Pierre Sylvain Regis as well as Dortous de Mairan. De Mairan was sympathetic to the views of Baruch Spinoza and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of Malebranche Malebranche assiduously resisted such an association.

Just as all human action is entirely dependent on God so too is all human cognition. Malebranche argued that human knowledge is dependent on divine understanding in a way analogous to that in which the motion of bodies is dependent on divine will. Like René Descartes Malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas immaterial representations present to the mind. But whereas Descartes believed ideas are mental entities Malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in God. These ideas therefore are uncreated and independent of finite minds. When we access them intellectually we apprehend objective truth. Malebranche defined truth as a relation between ideas since these ideas are in God they are eternal and immutable and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable. Malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection. The former constitute speculative truths such as those of geometry while the latter constitute the practical truths of ethics. Ethical principles for Malebranche are therefore divine in their foundation universal in their application and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation just as geometrical principles are.

With regard to this account of intellectual knowledge Malebranche was more or less following Saint Augustine. His great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception. The problem there is that the divine ideas are universal whereas all perception seems to be of particulars. Malebranches solution was to suggest that whereas the minds intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct its sensual perception of them will be modified by sensations. These sensations unlike the ideas are indeed proper to individual created minds and subsist as modes thereof. The idea will represent only the geometrical or mechanical properties of bodies while the sensation will consist in colour or some other sensible quality. The latter will limit the minds apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind. To a different mind one with a different sensation the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind. In the Dialogues On Metaphysics And Religion Malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for imagination in this case where the idea only lightly touches the mind.

Malebranche was strongly influenced by Descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically. He is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in God and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and occasionalism to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body. However his attribution of epistemological and explanatory primacy to God leads to difficulties.

Malebranches theodicy is his solution to the problem of evil. Although he conceded that God had the power to create a more perfect world free from all defects such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways. Thus God produces the natural evils that follow from simple laws not because he wills those particular effects but because he wills a world that best reflects his wisdom by achieving the best possible balance between the intrinsic perfection of the work and the simplicity and generality of its laws.

Whereas Malebranche followed Augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge in his approach to mindbody problems he began as a follower of Descartes. But in contrast to Descartes who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind Malebranche argues in the Dialogues on Metaphysics a dialogue between Theodore and Aristes that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind.

I am unable when I turn to myself to recognize any of my faculties or my capacities. The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me that I am that I think that I will that I have sensory awareness that I suffer and so on; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of what I am of the nature of my thought my sensations my passions or my pain or of the mutual relations that obtain between all these things. ...I have no idea whatever of my soul.

This leads Theodore to declare that I am not my own light to myself; the nature of our own minds is highly obscure. What is more with regard to psycho-physical interaction Malebranche argues that body could not act on mind nor mind on body. The only active power is God. When I will that my arm should rise my volition is the occasion or the occasional cause of the movement of my arm; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is God. Malebranches doctrine which could be found in contemporary commentaries on Aristotle and which first appeared in certain Arab philosophers is therefore called occasionalism.

In general occasionalism is the view that there are no efficient causes in the full sense other than God. Created things are at best occasions for divine activity. Bodies and minds act neither on themselves nor on each other; God alone brings about all the phenomena of nature and the mind. Changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities because God in creating the world observes what Malebranche calls order he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible and thus that the laws be simple and few in number.

In particular there will be laws governing what we would customarily call the interaction of body and mind so that similar movements in the body will occasion similar ideas in the mind. That relation has some features of the causal relation . But in reality both the idea in the mind and the movement in the body are caused by God.

Although better known for his philosophical work Malebranche made some notable contributions to physics working within a broadly Cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from Descartes where necessary. In 1699 he delivered an address to the Académie Royale des Sciences on the nature of light and color wherein he argued that different colors resulted out of different frequencies in the pressure vibrations of subtle matter much as different musical tones derived from different frequencies in the vibrations of air. His theory was presented as a corrective to Descartes view rather than a refutation thereof but it has important parallels with the rival optical theory of Isaac Newton. Newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier but Malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the Opticks of 1704 or more likely in its Latin translation of 1706. When Malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the Sixteenth Elucidation of the 1712 edition of The Search After Truth he inserted a number of references to Newtons excellent work.

In addition Malebranche wrote on the laws of motion a topic he discussed extensively with Leibniz. He also wrote on mathematics and although he made no major mathematical discoveries of his own he was instrumental in introducing and disseminating the contributions of Descartes and Leibniz in France. Malebranche introduced lHôpital to Johann Bernoulli with the ultimate result being the publication of the first textbook in infinitesimal calculus.

Malebranche also developed an original theory related to preformationism postulating that each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos ad infinitum like an idealized Matryoshka doll. According to Malebranche an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence .

Aside perhaps from John Norris there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of Malebranche in all matters. He was however held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures.

Pierre Bayle regarded Malebranche as one of the greatest philosophers of this age . In note H to his Zeno of Elea article Bayle discussed Malebranches views on material substance with particular approval. Occasionalism and the vision in God seem to make the real existence of material substance redundant. Not only is it unable to be directly perceived but it cannot actually affect us or anything else in any way at all. Descartes had also maintained that matter was not directly perceivable but he had argued that the veracity of God could support a proof of its certain existence. Malebranche however weakened Descartes argument concluding that from a philosophical point of view its existence could only be shown to be probable. Bayle pushed even further down this same path thereby laying much of the ground work for the immaterialism of George Berkeley. Berkeley influenced both by Bayle and directly by Malebranche himself simply took the final step to a full denial of the existence of material substance. Berkeley admittedly did reject the theory of vision in God. It is evident he insisted that the things I perceive are my own ideas. But he was influenced by Malebranches occasionalism even though he excluded the activity of created minds from its domain. In addition Berkeley agreed with Malebranche against Descartes that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself. John Locke had also argued for this but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point whereas both Berkeley and Malebranche maintained that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz also rejected the vision in God and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction. However in his own theodicy even if it was somewhat more elaborate than Malebranches he did at least agree with Malebranches fundamental contention that the simplicity of Gods ways had to be given as much regard as the worlds perfection.

David Hume supported and drew upon Malebranches negative arguments to show that no genuine causal connections could be conceived between distinct mundane entities. However when it came to finding a positive replacement for such causal connections he turned inwards to the workings of the human mind instead of turning upwards to God. With regard to this second half of Malebranches occasionalism Hume wrote

Humes empiricist epistemology led him to distrust Malebranches confidence in discovering abstruse metaphysical truths through an intellectual union with God. Likewise Locke felt that Malebranches metaphysical speculations lacked a proper foundation and though ingenious were ultimately unintelligible. In a somewhat similar manner Arthur Schopenhauer regarded the theory of vision in God as explaining something unknown by something even more unknown.

Locke withheld his An Examination of P have begun to argue that the originality and unity of his philosophical system merits him a place alongside such figures as Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz.

The Thomas Taylor translation of the Search includes material not contained in the Lennon and Olscamp edition . It is bound with Malebranches Defence against the Accusation of M. de la Ville which has not been available in English at all since the seventeenth century. The Treatise of Nature and Grace is also included in the same volume. Rival translations of all three of these works were also published by Richard Sault in 169495. In addition the Conversations chrétiennes were translated in 1695 as Christian Conferences... to which is added Meditations on Humility and Repentance this work has also been unavailable in English since the seventeenth century.

The standard edition of Malebranches works in French is the Œuvres Complètes ed. André Robinet twenty volumes ."
André Malet (philosopher),André Malet was a French Catholic priest and philosopher who became a Unitarian Protestant. Specialising in Martin Heidegger he translated Rudolf Bultmann into French. He married Nicole Maya-Malet another philosopher specialising in Heidegger who was director of the Revue déthique et de théologie morale published by CERF.

Manegold of Lautenbach,"Manegold of Lautenbach was a religious and polemical writer and Augustinian canon from Alsace active mostly as a teacher in south-west Germany.William of Champeaux may have been one of his pupils but this is disputed. He was one of the first magisters recognised masters of theology.

He engaged in a controversy with Wenrich of Trier taking the papal side in the era of the Investiture Controversy. He also attacked Wolfhelm of Brauweiler.

Towards the end of his life he was a reformer at the religious community at Marbach.

His Ad Gebehardum liber of 1085 was a comprehensive discussion of kingship original and much commented on and clarifying some of the political arguments most centrally used by the papal supporters; it argued that kingship was an office from which the king could be deposed; his functionalist analogy was with the position of swineherd held at the pleasure of the employer. This work dedicated to Gebhard archbishop of Salzburg was intended to refute a polemic letter of Wenrich on behalf of Emperor Henry IV written c.1080-1. A strong supporter of Pope Gregory VII and the Gregorian revolutionary reforms Manegold shared with others of his time the view in political thought that secular rulers held their power on the basis of some kind of pact with the ruled. Further when the pact could be considered broken the oath of allegiance could be considered null a theory of resistance adapted to aristocratic arguments that had not long previously been topical in Saxony; this theory had been documented in the 1082 Bellum Saxonicum of Bruno of Merseburg. The argument that in the past bad kings had frequently been deposed typically with papal involvement derived from a papal letter of 1075 to Hermann bishop of Metz.

Manegolds book also contained an account of the life of Gregory VII reflecting the Vita by John the Deacon of Gregory the Great; this shares details with chronicles of Berthold of Reichenau and Bernold of St Blasien writing in the part of southern Germany in which Manegold had sheltered after having to leave Alsace. Manegolds sources included St Paul Jerome Peter Damian and Bernold; also Pseudo-Chrysostoms Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum for the way the pact theory was expressed. Along with others arguing from the same side he used arguments from Cyprian De unitate ecclesiae in a version supporting papal primacy.

He opposed the uncritical acceptance by Christians of the views of pagan classical writers. He was a critic of Macrobius singling out for attack in geography the spherical earth theory of four isolated continents of Crates of Mallus on theological grounds.

After graduating from the École normale supérieure he became assistant to Raymond Aron at the Collège de France. He was one of the founders of the quarterly Commentaire and remains a regular contributor.

Manent is a key figure of the contemporary French political philosophy and his work has helped the rediscovery of the French liberal tradition. A eurosceptic and a classical liberal he has been called by The Weekly Standard the most profound of the Euroskeptical philosophers."
Alexandre Marc,"Alexandre Marc was a French writer and philosopher. He was the founder of personalist federalist communitarian thinking.

Marc was born as Alexandr Markovitch Lipiansky in Odessa Russian Empire in 1904in a Jewish family. During the Russian revolution he was expelled from the country and moved to Paris where he completed his secondary education at the Lycée Saint-Louis in the mid-twenties. He studied philosophy at Jena. When he returned to France he obtained a law degree and he graduated from Sciences Po in 1927.

After graduation Marc was employed by the Hachette Publishing company and founded a new press agency Pax-Presse.

In 1929 Marc and Denis de Rougemont organized a meeting spot for religious and ecumenical discussion of social and political issues le Club du Moulin Vert. In 1930 members of this organization including Marc founded the non conformist political organisation lOrdre Nouveau; Marc was one of the leaders until the group dissolved in 1938. Working within this group Marc and the group of Arnaud Dandieu developed between 1930 and 1933 the basic ideas of the personalist movement and non-conformists of the 30s. Alexandre Marc became a spokesperson of these ideas and participated in 1932 in the founding of the journal Esprit in which he published several articles putting forward the ideas of lOrdre Nouveau. He was later an editor for the periodical LOrdre Nouveau.

Marc converted to Catholicism after reading St. Augustine and after Dandieus death in October 1933. He began to write for the Dominican journal La vie intellectuelle and in 1935 became the assistant editor of the Catholic weekly Sept and later its successor the weekly Temps présent for which he wrote the press review under the pseudonym of Scrutator until the outbreak of war in 1939. He was part of the team that revived this publication from August 1940 to August 1941 under the title Temps Nouveaux and illegally created the Cahiers du Témoignage chrétien. During this time he co-authored Traditions socialistes françaises .

In 1943 during the French occupation Marc was in danger of arrest both for his views and his Jewish origins. Therefore he left for Switzerland where he studied Swiss federalism with its emphasis on democracy at the village and city level. In Switzerland from 1943 to 1944 he worked at Témoignage chrétien.

Marc participated in the creation of the group La Fédération and became in 1946 the Secretary General of the Union of European Federalists and in 1953 leader of the European Federalist Movement and founder of the journal LEurope en formation. As a founder of the Centre international de formation européenne in 1954 he participated in the organization of the Hague Congress.

Marc was the author of many books and articles in which he expressed his conception of integral federalism. He lectured extensively until his retirement on this subject at the Centre international de formation européenne and Centre international de formation européenne et lInstitut européen des hautes études internationales in Nice which he founded. He also lectured on a regular basis at the Collège dÉtudes Fédéralistes in Aosta.

In accordance his wishes his personal archives were deposited at the Historical Archives of the European Union in Florence."
Gabriel Marcel,"Gabriel Honoré Marcel was a French philosopher playwright music critic and leading Christian existentialist. The author of over a dozen books and at least thirty plays Marcels work focused on the modern individuals struggle in a technologically dehumanizing society. Though often regarded as the first French existentialist he dissociated himself from figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre preferring the term philosophy of existence or neo-Socrateanism to define his own thought. The Mystery of Being is a well-known two-volume work authored by Marcel.

Marcel was born on 7 December 1889 in Paris France. His mother Laure Meyer who was Jewish died when he was young and he was brought up by his aunt and father Henry Marcel. When he was eight he moved for a year where his father was minister plenipotentiary.

Marcel completed his DES thesis and obtained the agrégation in philosophy from the Sorbonne in 1910 at the unusually young age of 20. During the First World War he worked as head of the Information Service organized by the Red Cross to convey news of injured soldiers to their families. He taught in secondary schools was a drama critic for various literary journals and worked as an editor for Plon the major French Catholic publisher.

Marcel was the son of an agnostic and was himself not a member of any organized religion until his conversion to Catholicism in 1929. Marcel was opposed to anti-Semitism and supported reaching out to non-Catholics.

He is often classified as one of the earliest existentialists although he dreaded being placed in the same category as Jean-Paul Sartre; Marcel came to prefer the label neo-Socratic . While Marcel recognized that human interaction often involved objective characterisation of the other he still asserted the possibility of communion a state where both individuals can perceive each others subjectivity.

In The Existential Background of Human Dignity Marcel refers to a play he had written in 1913 entitled Le Palais de Sable in order to provide an example of a person who was unable to treat others as subjects.

Roger Moirans the central character of the play is a politician a conservative who is dedicated to defending the rights of Catholicism against free thought. He has set himself up as the champion of traditional monarchy and has just achieved a great success in the city council where he has attacked the secularism of public schools. It is natural enough that he should be opposed to the divorce of his daughter Therese who wants to leave her unfaithful husband and start her life afresh. In this instance he proves himself virtually heartless; all his tenderness goes out to his second daughter Clarisse whom he takes to be spiritually very much like himself. But now Clarisse tells him that she has decided to take the veil and become a Carmelite. Moirans is horrified by the idea that this creature so lovely intelligent and full of life might go and bury herself in a convent and he decides to do his utmost to make her give up her intention... Clarisse is deeply shocked; her father now appears to her as an impostor virtually as a deliberate fraud...

In this case Moirans is unable to treat either of his daughters as a subject instead rejecting both because each does not conform to her objectified image in his mind. Marcel notes that such objectification does no less than denude its object of the one thing which he has which is of value and so it degrades him effectively.

Another related major thread in Marcel was the struggle to protect ones subjectivity from annihilation by modern materialism and a technologically driven society. Marcel argued that scientific egoism replaces the mystery of being with a false scenario of human life composed of technical problems and solutions. For Marcel the human subject cannot exist in the technological world instead being replaced by a human object. As he points out in Man Against Mass Society and other works technology has a privileged authority with which it persuades the subject to accept his place as he in the internal dialogue of science; and as a result man is convinced by science to rejoice in his own annihilation.

For many years Marcel hosted a weekly philosophy discussion group through which he met and influenced important younger French philosophers like Jean Wahl Paul Ricœur Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. Marcel was puzzled and disappointed that his reputation was almost entirely based on his philosophical treatises and not on his plays which he wrote in the hope of appealing to a wider lay audience. He also influenced phenomenologist and Thomistic philosopher Karol Wojtyla who drew on Marcels distinction between being and having in his critique of technological change.

His major books are the Metaphysical Journal Being and Having Homo Viator Mystery of Being and Man Against Mass Society . He gave the William James Lectures at Harvard in 19611962 which were subsequently published as The Existential Background of Human Dignity."
Louis Marin (philosopher),"Louis Marin was a French philosopher historian semiotician and art critic.

He was born in La Tronche France. He is usually referred to as a French post-structuralistic thinker. He attended the University of Paris Sorbonne and graduated with a Licence in Philosophy in 1952. His degree was followed in 1953 with an Agrégé in Philosophy and with a Docteur dEtat in 1973. Marin taught at the University of Nanterre Paris from 1967 to 1970 the University of California San Diego from 1970 to 1974 Johns Hopkins University from 1974 to 1977 and finally at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris from 1977 to 1992. He was also an Associate of the Humanities Center at Johns Hopkins University from 1985 until his death in 1992 in Paris. Marin was widely known for his work in a variety of areas linguistics semiotics theology philosophy anthropology rhetoric art and institutional history and literary theory. Throughout his career Marins main intellectual focus was seventeenth-century French literature and art particularly the works of Blaise Pascal Perrault Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne. In addition he published numerous articles on the visual arts and religious texts.

Louis Marin has a lesser reputation than some of his contemporaries and friends such as Jacques Derrida Jean-François Lyotard and Michel de Certeau. Still his classes and his work have exerted a profound influence on certain historians art historians and literary historians ."
Jean-Luc Marion,"Jean-Luc Marion is a French philosopher and Roman Catholic theologian. Marion is a former student of Jacques Derrida whose work is informed by patristic and mystical theology phenomenology and modern philosophy. Much of his academic work has dealt with Descartes and phenomenologists like Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl but also religion. God Without Being for example is concerned predominantly with an analysis of idolatry a theme strongly linked in Marions work with love and the gift which is a concept also explored at length by Derrida.

Marion was born in Meudon Hauts-de-Seine on 3 July 1946. He studied at the University of Nanterre and the Sorbonne and then did graduate work in philosophy from the École normale supérieure in Paris from 1967 to 1971 where he was taught by Jacques Derrida Louis Althusser and Gilles Deleuze. At the same time Marions deep interest in theology was privately cultivated under the personal influence of theologians such as Louis Bouyer Jean Daniélou Henri de Lubac and Hans Urs von Balthasar. From 1972 to 1980 he studied for his doctorate and worked as an assistant lecturer at the Sorbonne. After receiving his doctorate in 1980 he began teaching at the University of Poitiers.

From there he moved to become the Director of Philosophy at the University Paris X Nanterre and in 1991 also took up the role of professeur invité at the Institut Catholique de Paris. In 1996 he became Director of Philosophy at the University of Paris IV where he still teaches.

Marion became a visiting professor at the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1994. He was then appointed the John Nuveen Professor of the Philosophy of Religion and Theology there in 2004 a position he held until 2010. That year he was appointed the Andrew Thomas Greeley and Grace McNichols Greeley Professor of Catholic Studies at the Divinity School a position that had been vacated by the retirement of theologian David Tracy.

On 6 November 2008 Marion was elected as an immortel by the Académie Française. Marion now occupies seat 4 an office previously held by Cardinal Lustiger.

Marions phenomenological work is set out in three volumes which together form a triptych or trilogy.Réduction et donation Etudes sur Husserl Heidegger et la phénoménologie is an historical study of the phenomenological method followed by Husserl and Heidegger with a view towards suggesting future directions for phenomenological research. The unexpected reaction that Réduction et donation provoked called for clarification and full development. This was addressed in Étant donné Essai dune phénoménologie de la donation a more conceptual work investigating phenomenological givenness the saturated phenomenon and the gifteda rethinking of the subject. Du surcroît provides an in-depth description of saturated phenomena.

Marion claims that he has attempted to radically reduce the whole phenomenological project beginning with the primacy in it of givenness. What he describes as his one and only theme is the givenness that is required before phenomena can show themselves in consciousnesswhat shows itself first gives itself. This is based on the argument that any and all attempts to lead phenomena back to immanence in consciousness that is to exercise the phenomenological reduction necessarily results in showing that givenness is the sole horizon of phenomena

Marion radicalizes this argument in the formulation As much reduction as much givenness and offers this as a new first principle of phenomenology building on and challenging prior formulae of Husserl and Heidegger. The formulation common to both Marion argues So much appearance so much Being adopted from Johann Friedrich Herbart erroneously elevates appearing to the status of the sole face of Being. In doing so it leaves appearing itself undetermined not subject to the reduction and thus in a typically metaphysical situation.

The Husserlian formulation To the things themselves is criticized on the basis that the things in question would remain what they are even without appearing to a subjectagain circumventing the reduction or even without becoming phenomena. Appearing becomes merely a mode of access to objects rendering the formulation inadequate as a first principle of phenomenology. A third formulation Husserls Principle of all Principles states that every primordial dator Intuition is a source of authority for knowledge that whatever presents itself in intuition...is simply to be accepted as it gives itself out to be though only within the limits in which it then presents itself. Marion argues that while the Principle of all Principles places givenness as phenomenalitys criterion and achievement givenness still remains uninterrogated. Whereas it admits limits to intuition givenness alone is absolute free and without condition

Givenness then is not reducible except to itself and so is freed from the limits of any other authority including intuition; a reduced given is either given or not given. As much reduction as much givenness states that givenness is what the reduction accomplishes and any reduced given is reduced to givenness. The more a phenomenon is reduced the more it is given. Marion calls the formulation the last principle equal to the first that of the appearing itself.

By describing the structures of phenomena from the basis of givenness Marion claims to have succeeded in describing certain phenomena that previous metaphysical and phenomenological approaches either ignore or excludegivens that show themselves but which a thinking that does not go back to the given is powerless to receive. In all three types of phenomena can be shown according to the proportionality between what is given in intuition and what is intended

Marion defines saturated phenomena which contradict the Kantian claim that phenomena can only occur if they are congruent with the a priori knowledge upon which an observers cognitive function is founded. For example Kant would claim that the phenomenon three years is a longer period of time than four years cannot occur.

According to Marion saturated phenomena overwhelm the observer with their complete and perfect givenness such that they are not shaped by the particulars of the observers cognition at all. These phenomena may be conventionally impossible and still occur because their givenness saturates the cognitive architecture innate to the observer.

The fourth section of Marions work Prolegomena to Charity is entitled The Intentionality of Love and primarily concerns intentionality and phenomenology. Influenced by the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas Marion explores the human idea of love and its lack of definition We live with love as if we knew what it was about. But as soon as we try to define it or at least approach it with concepts it draws away from us. He begins by explaining the essence of consciousness and its lived experiences. Paradoxically the consciousness concerns itself with objects transcendent and exterior to itself objects irreducible to consciousness but can only comprehend its interpretation of the object; the reality of the object arises from consciousness alone. Thus the problem with love is that to love another is to love ones own idea of another or the lived experiences that arise in the consciousness from the chance cause of another I must then name this love my love since it would not fascinate me as my idol if first it did not render to me like an unseen mirror the image of myself. Love loved for itself inevitably ends as self-love in the phenomenological figure of self-idolatry. Marion believes intentionality is the solution to this problem and explores the difference between the I who intentionally sees objects and the me who is intentionally seen by a counter-consciousness another whether the me likes it or not. Marion defines another by its invisibility; one can see objects through intentionality but in the invisibility of the other one is seen. Marion explains this invisibility using the pupil Even for a gaze aiming objectively the pupil remains a living refutation of objectivity an irremediable denial of the object; here for the first time in the very midst of the visible there is nothing to see except an invisible and untargetable void...my gaze for the first time sees an invisible gaze that sees it. Love then when freed from intentionality is the weight of this others invisible gaze upon ones own the cross of ones own gaze and the others and the unsubstitutability of the other. Love is to render oneself there in an unconditional surrender...no other gaze must respond to the ecstasy of this particular other exposed in his gaze. Perhaps in allusion to a theological argument Marion concludes that this type of surrender requires faith."
Jacques Maritain,"Jacques Maritain was a French Catholic philosopher. Raised Protestant he was agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books he helped to revive Thomas Aquinas for modern times and was influential in the development and drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope Paul VI presented his Message to Men of Thought and of Science at the close of Vatican II to Maritain his long-time friend and mentor. The same pope had seriously considered making him a lay cardinal but Maritain rejected it. Maritains interest and works spanned many aspects of philosophy including aesthetics political theory philosophy of science metaphysics the nature of education liturgy and ecclesiology.

Maritain was born in Paris the son of Paul Maritain who was a lawyer and his wife Geneviève Favre the daughter of Jules Favre and was reared in a liberal Protestant milieu. He was sent to the Lycée Henri-IV. Later he attended the Sorbonne studying the natural sciences chemistry biology and physics.

At the Sorbonne he met Raïssa Oumançoff a Russian Jewish émigré. They married in 1904. A noted poet and mystic she participated as his intellectual partner in his search for truth. Raïssas sister Vera Oumançoff lived with Jacques and Raïssa for almost all their married life.

At the Sorbonne Jacques and Raïssa soon became disenchanted with scientism which could not in their view address the larger existential issues of life. In 1901 in light of this disillusionment they made a pact to commit suicide together if they could not discover some deeper meaning to life within a year. They were spared from following through on this because at the urging of Charles Péguy they attended the lectures of Henri Bergson at the Collège de France. Bergsons critique of scientism dissolved their intellectual despair and instilled in them the sense of the absolute. Then through the influence of Léon Bloy they converted to the Catholic faith in 1906.

In the fall of 1907 the Maritains moved to Heidelberg where Jacques studied biology under Hans Driesch. Hans Drieschs theory of neo-vitalism attracted Jacques because of its affinity with Henri Bergson. During this time Raïssa fell ill and during her convalescence their spiritual advisor a Dominican friar named Humbert Clérissac introduced her to the writings of Thomas Aquinas. She read them with enthusiasm and in turn exhorted her husband to examine the saints writings. In Thomas Maritain found a number of insights and ideas that he had believed all along. He wrote

Thenceforth in affirming to myself without chicanery or diminution the authentic value of the reality of our human instruments of knowledge I was already a Thomist without knowing it... When several months later I came to the Summa Theologiae I would construct no impediment to its luminous flood.

From the Angelic Doctor he was led to The Philosopher as Aquinas called Aristotle. Still later to further his intellectual development he read the neo-Thomists.

Beginning in 1912 Maritain taught at the Collège Stanislas. He later moved to the Institut Catholique de Paris. For the 19161917 academic year he taught at the Petit Séminaire de Versailles. In 1930 Maritain and Étienne Gilson received honorary doctorates in philosophy from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas Angelicum. In 1933 he gave his first lectures in North America in Toronto at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. He also taught at Columbia University; at the Committee on Social Thought University of Chicago; at the University of Notre Dame and at Princeton University.

From 1945 to 1948 he was the French ambassador to the Holy See.

Afterwards he returned to Princeton University where he achieved the Elysian status of a professor emeritus in 1956. Raïssa Maritain died in 1960. After her death Jacques published her journal under the title Raïssas Journal. For several years Maritain was an honorary chairman of the Congress for Cultural Freedom appearing as a keynote speaker at its 1960 conference in Berlin.

That question offends me for I should have a horror of belonging to Freemasonry. So much the worse for well-intentioned people whose anxiety and need for explanations would have been satisfied by believing me to be one.

Jacques and Raïssa Maritain are buried in the cemetery of Kolbsheim a little French village in Alsace where he had spent many summers at the estate of his friends Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius.

A cause for beatification of him and his wife Raïssa is being planned.

The foundation of Maritains thought is Aristotle Aquinas and the Thomistic commentators especially John of St. Thomas. He is eclectic in his use of these sources. Maritains philosophy is based on evidence accrued by the senses and acquired by an understanding of first principles. Maritain defended philosophy as a science against those who would degrade it and promoted philosophy as the queen of sciences.

In 1910 Jacques Maritain completed his first contribution to modern philosophy a 28-page article titled Reason and Modern Science published in Revue de Philosophie . In it he warned that science was becoming a divinity its methodology usurping the role of reason and philosophy. Science was supplanting the humanities in importance.

In 1917 a committee of French bishops commissioned Jacques to write a series of textbooks to be used in Catholic colleges and seminaries. He wrote and completed only one of these projects titled Elements de Philosophie in 1920. It has been a standard text ever since in many Catholic seminaries. He wrote in his introduction

If the philosophy of Aristotle as revived and enriched by Thomas Aquinas and his school may rightly be called the Christian philosophy both because the church is never weary of putting it forward as the only true philosophy and because it harmonizes perfectly with the truths of faith nevertheless it is proposed here for the readers acceptance not because it is Christian but because it is demonstrably true. This agreement between a philosophic system founded by a pagan and the dogmas of revelation is no doubt an external sign an extra-philosophic guarantee of its truth; but from its own rational evidence that it derives its authority as a philosophy

During the Second World War Jacques Maritain protested the policies of the Vichy government while teaching at the Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies in Canada. Moving to New York Maritain became deeply involved in rescue activities seeking to bring persecuted and threatened academics many of them Jews to America. He was instrumental in founding the École Libre des Hautes Études a kind of university in exile that was at the same time the center of Gaullist resistance in the United States. After the war in a papal audience on 16 July 1946 he tried unsuccessfully to have Pope Pius XII officially denounce anti-semitism.

Many of his American papers are held by the University of Notre Dame which established The Jacques Maritain Center in 1957. The Cercle dEtudes Jacques Raïssa Maritain is an association founded by the philosopher himself in 1962 in Kolbsheim where the couple is also buried. The purpose of these centers is to encourage study and research of Maritains thought and expand upon them. It is also absorbed in translating and editing his writings.

Maritains philosophy is based on the view that metaphysics is prior to epistemology. Being is first apprehended implicitly in sense experience and is known in two ways. First being is known reflexively by abstraction from sense experience. One experiences a particular being e.g. a cup a dog etc. and through reflexion on the judgement e.g. this is a dog one recognizes that the object in question is an existent. Second in light of attaining being reflexively through apprehension of sense experience one may arrive at what Maritain calls an Intuition of Being. For Maritain this is the point of departure for metaphysics; without the intuition of being one cannot be a metaphysician at all. The intuition of being involves rising to the apprehension of ens secundum quod est ens . In Existence and the Existent he explains

In view of this priority given to metaphysics Maritain advocates an epistemology he calls Critical Realism. Maritains epistemology is not critical in Kants sense which held that one could only know anything after undertaking a thorough critique of ones cognitive abilities. Rather it is critical in the sense that it is not a naive or non-philosophical realism but one that is defended by way of reason. Against Kants critical project Maritain argues that epistemology is reflexive; you can only defend a theory of knowledge in light of knowledge you have already attained. Consequently the critical question is not the question of modern philosophy how do we pass from what is perceived to what is. Rather Since the mind from the very start reveals itself as warranted in its certitude by things and measured by an esse independent of itself how are we to judge if how on what conditions and to what extent it is so both in principle and in the various moments of knowledge

In contrast idealism inevitably ends up in contradiction since it does not recognize the universal scope of the first principles of identity contradiction and finality. These become merely laws of thought or language but not of being which opens the way to contradictions being instantiated in reality.

Maritains metaphysics ascends from this account of being to a critique of the philosophical aspects of modern science through analogy to an account of the existence and nature of God as it is known philosophically and through mystical experience.

Maritain was a strong defender of a natural law ethics. He viewed ethical norms as being rooted in human nature. For Maritain the natural law is known primarily not through philosophical argument and demonstration but rather through Connaturality. Connatural knowledge is a kind of knowledge by acquaintance. We know the natural law through our direct acquaintance with it in our human experience. Of central importance is Maritains argument that natural rights are rooted in the natural law. This was key to his involvement in the drafting of the UNs Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Another important aspect of his ethics was his insistence upon the need for moral philosophy to be conducted in a theological context. While a Christian could engage in speculative thought about nature or metaphysics in a purely rational manner and develop an adequate philosophy of nature of metaphysics this is not possible with ethics. Moral philosophy must address the actual state of the human person and this is a person in a state of grace. Thus moral philosophy adequately considered must take into account properly theological truths. It would be impossible for instance to develop an adequate moral philosophy without giving consideration to properly theological facts such as original sin and the supernatural end of the human person in beatitude. Any moral philosophy that does not take into account these realities that are only known through faith would be fundamentally incomplete.

Maritain corresponded with and was a friend of the American radical community organizer Saul Alinsky and French Prime Minister Robert Schuman.

In the study The Radical Vision of Saul Alinsky author P. David Finks noted that For years Jacques Maritain had spoken approvingly to Montini of the democratic community organizations built by Saul Alinsky. Accordingly in 1958 Maritain arranged for a series of meetings between Alinsky and Archbishop Montini in Milan. Before the meetings Maritain had written to Alinsky the new cardinal was reading Sauls books and would contact him soon.

In an interview from 2016 Pope Francis praised Maritain among a small list of French liberal thinkers.

Maritain advocated what he called Integral Humanism . He argued that secular forms of humanism were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person. Once the spiritual dimension of human nature is rejected we no longer have an integral but merely partial humanism one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly in Integral Humanism he explores the prospects for a new Christendom rooted in his philosophical pluralism in order to find ways Christianity could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. Maritains political theory was extremely influential and was a primary source behind the Christian Democratic movement."
Paul Masson-Oursel,"Paul Masson-Oursel was a French orientalist and philosopher a pioneer of comparative philosophy.

Masson-Oursel was a student of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl Henri Bergson Emile Durkheim Pierre Janet André Lalande Marcel Mauss. With Sylvain Lévy Alfred Foucher Chavannes Clément Huart he learned Sanskrit Tibetan Chinese Arab.La Philosophie Comparée his Sorbonne doctoral dissertation attempted to apply Comtean positivism and a comparative method which identified analogies between the philosophies of Europe India and China. Masson-Oursel argued that philosophy cannot achieve positivity so long as its investigations are restricted to the thought of our own civilization since no one philosophy has the right to put itself forward as co-extensive with the human mind."
Jean-François Mattéi,Jean-François Mattéi was a French philosopher and professor of Greek philosophy and political philosophy at the University of Nice.
Charles Maurras,"Charles-Marie-Photius Maurras was a French author politician poet and critic. He was an organizer and principal philosopher of Action Française a political movement that was monarchist anti-parliamentarist and counter-revolutionary. Maurras ideas greatly influenced National Catholicism and integral nationalism. A major tenet of integral nationalism was stated by Maurras as a true nationalist places his country above everything. A political theorist and a major intellectual influence in early 20th-century Europe his views influenced several far-right ideologies; they also prefigured some of the ideas of fascism.

Maurras was born into a Provençal family brought up by his mother and grandmother in a Catholic and monarchist environment. In his early teens he became deaf. Like many other French politicians he was affected greatly by Frances defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. After the 1871 Commune of Paris and the 1879 defeat of Marshal MacMahons Moral Order government French society slowly found a consensus for the Republic symbolized by the rallying of the monarchist Orleanists to the Republic. Maurras published his first article at the age of 17 years in the review Annales de philosophie chrétienne. He then collaborated on various reviews including LÉvénement La Revue bleue La Gazette de France and La Revue encyclopédique in which he praised Classicism and attacked Romanticism.

At some point during his youth Maurras lost his Catholic faith and became an agnostic. In 1887 at the age of seventeen he came to Paris and began writing literary criticism in the Catholic and Orleanist Observateur. At this time Maurras was influenced by Orleanism as well as German philosophy reviewed by Catholic thinker Léon Ollé-Laprune an influence of Henri Bergson and by the philosopher Maurice Blondel one of the inspirations of Christian modernists who would later become his greatest opponents. He became acquainted with the Provençal poet Frédéric Mistral in 1888 and shared the federalist thesis of Mistrals Félibrige movement . The same year he met the nationalist writer Maurice Barrès.

In 1890 Maurras approved Cardinal Lavigeries call for the rallying of Catholics to the Republic thus making his opposition not to the Republic in itself but to sectarian Republicanism.

Beside this Orleanist affiliation Maurras shared some traits with Bonapartism. In December 1887 he demonstrated to the cry of Down with the robbers during the military decorations trafficking scandal which had involved Daniel Wilson the son-in-law of President Jules Grévy. Despite this he initially opposed the nationalist-populist Boulangist philosophy. But in 1889 after a visit to Maurice Barrès Barrès voted for the Boulangist candidate; despite his anti-Semitism of the heart he decided to vote for a Jew.

During 18941895 Maurras briefly worked for Barrès newspaper La Cocarde although he sometimes opposed Barrès opinions concerning the French Revolution.La Cocarde supported General Boulanger who had become a threat to the parliamentary Republic in the late 1880s.

During a trip to Athens for the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 Maurras came to criticize the Greek democratic system of the polis which he considered doomed because of its internal divisions and its openness towards métèques .

Maurras became involved in politics at the time of the Dreyfus affair becoming an Anti-Dreyfusard. He endorsed Colonel Henrys forgery blaming Dreyfus as he considered that defending Dreyfus weakened the Army and the justice system. According to Maurras Dreyfus was to be sacrificed on the altar of national interest. But while the Republican nationalist thinker Barrès accused Dreyfus of being guilty because of his Jewishness Maurras went a step further vilifying the Jewish Republic. While Barrès anti-Semitism originated both in pseudo-scientific racist contemporary theories and Biblical exegesis Maurras decried scientific racism in favor of a more radical state anti-Semitism.Maurras assisted with the foundation of the nationalist and anti-Dreyfusard Ligue de la patrie française at the end of 1898 along with Maurice Barrès the geographer Marcel Dubois the poet François Coppée and the critic and literature professor Jules Lemaître.

In 1899 Maurras founded the review Action Française an offshoot of the newspaper created by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois the year preceding. Maurras quickly became influential in the movement and converted Pujo and Vaugeois to monarchism which became the movements principal cause. With Léon Daudet he edited the movements review La Revue de lAction Française which during 1908 became a daily newspaper with the shorter title LAction Française. The AF mixed integral nationalism with reactionary themes shifting the nationalist ideology previously supported by left-wing Republicans to the political right. It had a wide readership during the implementation of the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State. In 1899 he wrote a short notice in favour of monarchy Dictateur et roi and then in 1900 his Enquête sur la monarchie published in the Legitimist mouthpiece La Gazette de France which made him famous. Maurras also published thirteen articles in the newspaper Le Figaro during 1901 and 1902 as well as six articles between November 1902 and January 1903 in Edouard Drumonts anti-Semitic newspaper La Libre Parole.

Between 1905 and 1908 when the Camelots du Roi monarchist league was initiated Maurras introduced the concept of political activism through extra-parliamentary leagues theorizing the possibility of a coup détat. Maurras also founded the Ligue dAction Française in 1905 whose mission was to recruit members for the Action Française.Members pledged to fight the republican regime and to support restoration of the monarchy under Prince Philippe Duke of Orléans .

Many early members of the Action Française were practicing Catholics including Bernard de Vésins the art historian Louis Dimier and the essayist Léon de Montesquiou. They helped Maurras develop the royalist leagues pro-Catholic policies.

Maurras then endorsed Frances entry into World War I against the German Empire. During the war the Jewish businessman Emile Ullman was forced to resign from the board of directors of the Comptoir dEscompte bank after Maurras accused him of being a German agent. He then criticized the Treaty of Versailles for not being harsh enough on the Germans and condemned Aristide Briands policy of cooperation with Germany.

In 1925 he called for the murder of Abraham Schrameck the Interior Minister of Paul Painlevés Cartel des Gauchess government who had ordered the disarming of the far-right leagues. For this death threat he was sentenced to a fine and a year in jail . He also voiced death threats against the President of the Council Léon Blum organizer of the Popular Front in the Action Française of 15 May 1936 emphasizing his Jewish origins . This other death threat earned him eight months in prison from 29 October 1936 to 6 July 1937. Fearing communism he joined the pacifists and praised the Munich Agreement of 1938 which the President of the Council Édouard Daladier had signed without any illusions. He also wrote in Action Française

There are certain conservatives in France who fill us with disgust. Why Because of their stupidity. What kind of stupidity Hitlerism. These French conservatives crawl on their bellies before Hitler. These former nationalists cringe before him. A few zealots wallow in dirt in their own dirt with endless Heils. The wealthier they are the more they own the more important it is to make them understand that if Hitler invaded us he would skin them much more thoroughly than Blum Thorez and Stalin combined. This conservative error is suicidal. We must appeal to our friends not to let themselves be befogged. We must tell them Be on your guard What is now at stake is not anti-democracy or anti-Semitism. France above all

During the 1930s especially after the 6 February 1934 crisismany of Action Française members turned to fascism including Robert Brasillach Lucien Rebatet Abel Bonnard Paul Chack and Claude Jeantet. Most of them belonged to the staff of the fascist newspaper Je suis partout .

Influencing António de Oliveira Salazars Estado Novo regime in Portugal Maurras also supported Francisco Franco and until spring 1939 Benito Mussolinis Fascist regime. Opposing Adolf Hitler because he was anti-German Maurras himself criticized the racist policies of Nazism in 1936 and requested a complete translation of Mein Kampf some passages had been censored in the French edition.

After his failure against Charles Jonnart in 1924 to be elected to the Académie française he succeeded in entering the ranks of the Immortals on 9 June 1938 replacing Henri-Robert winning by 20 votes against 12 to Fernand Gregh. He was received in the Academy on 8 June 1939 by Catholic writer Henry Bordeaux.

Although in June 1940 articles in Action Française signed by Maurras Léon Daudet and Maurice Pujo praised General Charles de Gaulle Maurras soon welcomed the end of the Third Republic replaced by Marshal Philippe Pétains Vichy France as a divine surprise. Vichys reactionary program of a Révolution Nationale was fully approved of by Maurras who inspired large parts of it. The monarchist newspaper was forbidden in the Occupied Zone and under Vichy censorship in the Southern Zone from November 1942. In La Seule France Maurras argued for a policy of France dabord whereby France would restore itself politically and morally under Pétain resolving the causes in his eyes of Frances defeat in 1940 before dealing with the issue of the foreign occupation. This position was contrasted to the attitude of the Gaullists who fled France and continued the military struggle. Maurras savaged the pre-war French governments for taking an increasingly bellicose position vis-à-vis Germany at precisely the same time that these governments were weakening France militarily socially and politically thereby making Frances defeat during 1940 all but inevitable. Maurras also criticized the 1940 Law on the status of Jews for being too moderate. At the same time he continued to express elements of his longstanding antipathy towards Germany by arguing in La Seule France that Frenchmen must not be drawn to that countrys model and by hosting anti-German conferences and he opposed both the dissidents in London and the collaborators in Paris and Vichy . In 1943 the Germans planned to arrest Maurras.

A pre-war admirer of Charles de Gaulle who himself had been influenced by Maurras integralism Maurras then harshly criticized the General in exile. He later claimed he believed that Pétain was playing a double game working for an Allied victory in secret.

After the liberation of France Maurras was arrested in September 1944 together with his right-hand man Maurice Pujo and indicted before the High Court of Lyon for complicity with the enemy on the basis of the articles he had published since the beginning of the war. At the end of the trial during which there were many irregularities such as false dating or truncated quotations Maurras was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil liberties. He was automatically dismissed from the Académie française . His response to his conviction was to exclaim Cest la revanche de Dreyfus Meanwhile the Académie française declared his seat vacant as it had for Pétains instead of expelling him as it did for Abel Hermant and Abel Bonnard. 

After being imprisoned in Riom and then Clairvaux Maurras was released in March 1952 to enter hospital. He was supported by Henry Bordeaux who repeatedly asked the President of the Republic Vincent Auriol to pardon Maurras. Although weakened Maurras collaborated with Aspects de la France which had replaced the outlawed review Action Française in 1947. He was transferred to a clinic in Tours where he died soon afterwards. In his last days he readopted the Catholic faith of his childhood and received the last rites.

A Provence-born author Maurras joined Félibrige a literary and cultural association founded by Frédéric Mistral and other Provençal writers to defend and promote Occitan languages and literature. The name of the association was derived from félibre a Provençal word meaning pupil or follower.

Maurras political ideas were based on intense nationalism and a belief in an ordered society based on strong government. These were the bases of his endorsement for both a French monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church.

He formulated an aggressive political strategy which contrasted with the Legitimists apathy for political action. He managed to combine the paradox of a reactionary thought which would actively change history a form of Counter-revolution opposed to simple conservatism. His integral nationalism rejected all democratic principles which he judged contrary to natural inequality criticizing all evolution since the 1789 French Revolution and advocated the return to a hereditary monarchy.

Like many people in Europe at the time he was haunted by the idea of decadence partly inspired by his reading of the publications of Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan and admired classicism. He felt that France had lost its grandeur during the Revolution of 1789 a grandeur inherited from its origins as a province of the Roman Empire and forged by as he put it forty kings who in a thousand years made France. The French Revolution he wrote in the Observateur Français was negative and destructive.

He traced this decline further back to the Enlightenment and the Reformation; he described the source of the evil as Swiss ideas a reference to the adopted nation of Calvin and the birth nation of Rousseau. Maurras further blamed Frances decline on Anti-France which he defined as the four confederate states of Protestants Jews Freemasons and foreigners . Indeed to him the first three were all internal foreigners.

Antisemitism and anti-Protestantism were common themes in his writings. He believed that the Reformation the Enlightenment and the eventual outcome of the French Revolution had all contributed to individuals valuing themselves more than the nation with consequent negative effects on the latter and that democracy and liberalism were only making matters worse.

Although Maurras advocated the revival of monarchy in many ways Maurras did not typify the French monarchist tradition. His endorsement of the monarchy and for Catholicism was explicitly pragmatic as he alleged that a state religion was the only way of maintaining public order. By contrast with Maurice Barrès a theorist of a kind of Romantic nationalism based on the Ego Maurras claimed to base his opinions on reason rather than on sentiment loyalty and faith.

Paradoxically he admired the positivist philosopher Auguste Comte like many of the Third Republic politicians he detested with which he opposed German idealism. Whereas the Legitimist monarchists refused to engage in political action retreating into an intransigently conservative Catholicism and a relative indifference to a modern world they believed was irredeemably wicked and apostate Maurras was prepared to engage in political action both orthodox and unorthodox . Maurras was twice convicted of inciting violence against Jewish politicians and Léon Blum the first Jewish French prime minister nearly died from the injuries inflicted by associates of Maurras. His slogan was the phrase La politique dabord . Other influences included Frédéric Le Play British empiricism which allowed him to reconcile Cartesian rationalism with empiricism and René de La Tour du Pin.

Maurras religious views were likewise less than orthodox. He supported the political Catholic Church both because it was intimately involved with French history and because its hierarchical structure and clerical elite mirrored his image of an ideal society. He considered the Church to be the mortar which held France together and the association linking all Frenchmen together. However he distrusted the Gospels written as he put it by four obscure Jews but admired the Catholic Church for having allegedly concealed much of the Bibles dangerous teachings. Maurras interpretation of the Gospels and his integralist teachings were fiercely criticised by many Catholic clergy. However towards the end of his life Maurras eventually converted from agnosticism to Catholicism.

Notwithstanding his religious unorthodoxy Maurras gained a large following among French monarchists and Catholics including the Assumptionists and the Orleanist pretender to the French throne the comte de Paris Philippe. Nonetheless his agnosticism worried parts of the Catholic hierarchy and in 1926 Pope Pius XI placed some of Maurrass writings on the Index of Forbidden Books and condemned the Action Française philosophy as a whole. Seven of Maurras books had already been placed on this list in 1914 and a dossier on Maurras had been submitted to Pius X.

It was not just his agnosticism which worried the Catholic hierarchy but that by insisting upon politiques dabord he questioned the primacy of the spiritual and thus the teaching authority of the Church and the authority of the Pope himself. That this was the basis of the matter is shown by Jacques Maritains book Primauté du Spirituel. Maritain was associated with LAction Française and knew Maurras. While his unease with the movement pre-dates the 1926 crisis it was this which occasioned his alienation from Maurras and LAction Française. This papal condemnation was a great surprise to many of his devotees who included a considerable number of French clergy and caused great damage to the movement. It was ended however in 1939 a year after Maurras was elected to the Académie française.

Maurras was a major intellectual influence of national Catholicism far-right movements Latin conservatism and integral nationalism. He and the Action Française influenced many people and movements including General Francisco Franco José Antonio Primo de Rivera António Sardinha Leon Degrelle and autonomist movements in Europe. The Christian Democrat Jacques Maritain was also close to Maurras before the papal condemnation of the AF in 1927 and criticized democracy in one of his early writings Une opinion sur Charles Maurras ou le devoir des catholiques. Furthermore Maurrassism also influenced many writings from members of the Organisation armée secrète who theorized counter-revolutionary warfare. In Spain the Acción Española adopted not only its far right monarchism but also its name from Maurrass movement.

The influence extended to Latin America as in Mexico where Jesús Guiza y Acevedo was nicknamed the little Maurras as well as the historian Carlos Pereyra or the Venezuelan author Laureano Vallenilla Lanz who wrote a book titled Cesarismo democrático . Other figures influenced include the Brazilian Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira. Maurras thought also influenced Catholic fundamentalist supporters of the Brazilian dictatorship as well as the Cursillos de la Cristiandad similar to the Cité Catholique group which were initiated during 1950 by the bishop of Ciudad Real Mgr. Hervé. The Argentine militarist Juan Carlos Onganía who overthrew Arturo Illia in a military putsch in 1969 as well as Alejandro Agustín Lanusse who succeeded Onganía after another coup had participated in the Cursillos de la Cristiandad as did also the Dominican militarists Antonio Imbert Barrera and Elías Wessin y Wessin chief of staff of the military and an opponent of the restoration of the 1963 Constitution after Rafael Trujillo was deposed. In Argentina he also influenced the nationalist writers of the 1920s and 1930s such as Rodolfo Irazusta and Juan Carulla.

In 2017 Michael Crowley wrote that Steve Bannon then chief strategist to President Donald Trump has also expressed admiration for the reactionary French philosopher Charles Maurras according to French media reports confirmed by Politico."
Quentin Meillassoux,"Quentin Meillassoux is a French philosopher. He teaches at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.

Quentin Meillassoux is the son of the anthropologist Claude Meillassoux. He is a former student of the philosophers Bernard Bourgeois and Alain Badiou. He is married to the novelist and philosopher Gwenaëlle Aubry.

Meillassouxs first book is After Finitude . Alain Badiou Meillassouxs former teacher wrote the foreword. Badiou describes the work as introducing a new possibility for philosophy which is different from Immanuel Kants three alternatives of criticism skepticism and dogmatism. The book was translated into English by Ray Brassier. Meillassoux is associated with the speculative realism movement.

In this book Meillassoux argues that post-Kantian philosophy is dominated by what he calls correlationism the theory that humans cannot exist without the world nor the world without humans. In Meillassouxs view this theory allows philosophy to avoid the problem of how to describe the world as it really is independent of human knowledge. He terms this reality independent of human knowledge as the ancestral realm. Following the commitment to mathematics of his mentor Alain Badiou Meillassoux claims that mathematics describes the primary qualities of things as opposed to their secondary qualities shown by perception.

Meillassoux argues that in place of the agnostic scepticism about the reality of cause and effect there should be a radical certainty that there is no causality at all. Following the rejection of causality Meillassoux says that it is absolutely necessary that the laws of nature be contingent. The world is a kind of hyper-chaos in which the principle of sufficient reason is not necessary. But Meillassoux says that the principle of non-contradiction is necessary. 

For these reasons Meillassoux rejects Kants Copernican Revolution in philosophy. Since Kant makes the world dependent on the conditions by which humans observe it Meillassoux accuses Kant of a Ptolemaic Counter-Revolution. Meillassoux clarified and revised some of the views published in After Finitude during his lectures at the Free University of Berlin in 2012.

Several of Meillassouxs articles have appeared in English via the British philosophical journal Collapse helping to spark interest in his work in the Anglophone world. His unpublished dissertation Linexistence divine is noted in After Finitude to be forthcoming in book form; as of 2021 it had not yet been published. In Parrhesia in 2016 an excerpt from Meillassouxs dissertation was translated by Nathan Brown who noted in his introduction that what is striking about the document... is the marked difference of its rhetorical strategies its order of reasons and its philosophical style from After Finitude counter to the general view that the latter merely constituted a partial précis of Linexistence divine; he notes further that the dissertation presents a very different articulation of the Principle of Factiality from that in After Finitude.

In September 2011 Meillassouxs book on Stéphane Mallarmé was published in France under the title Le nombre et la sirène. Un déchiffrage du coup de dés de Mallarmé. In this second book he offers a detailed reading of Mallarmés famous poem Un coup de dés jamais nabolira le hasard in which he finds a numerical code at work in the text."
René Ménil,"René Ménil was a French surrealist writer and philosopher who lived on the island of Martinique.

Born and raised on the island of Martinique Ménil was one of several of the islands natives who studied in France and returned to influence the independence movement with the ideas of Marxism and Surrealism. He was involved in helping to publish a literary journal in 1932 with Étienne Léro called Légitime Défense. He also began the Antillanité movement.

In the early 1940s Ménil started a journal called Tropiques along with other notable Martinique writers such as Aimé Césaire. The publication spoke very strongly against French colonialism in its essays. To avoid retaliation from their powerful critics they portrayed the magazine as a journal of West Indian folklore.

A professor and writer throughout his life in 1981 Ménil published a book of essays entitled Tracées urlright 0.1em center9px no-repeat.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration abackgroundlinear-gradienturlright 0.1em center9px no-repeat.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundlinear-gradienturlright 0.1em center9px no-repeat.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dotted;cursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundlinear-gradienturlright 0.1em center12px no-repeat.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinherit;backgroundinherit;bordernone;paddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynone;font-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynone;color33aa33;margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflinkfont-weightinheritISBN978-22-2100-633-7."
Maurice Merleau-Ponty,"Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty was a French phenomenological philosopher strongly influenced by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception art politics religion biology psychology psychoanalysis language nature and history. He was the lead editor of Les Temps modernes the leftist magazine he established with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in 1945.

At the core of Merleau-Pontys philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role perception plays in our experience of the world. Merleau-Ponty understands perception to be an ongoing dialogue between ones lived body and the world which it perceives in which perceivers passively and actively strive to express the perceived world in concert with others. He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences and especially with Gestalt psychology. It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalizing phenomenology in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.

Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could not be disentangled from each other. The articulation of the primacy of embodiment led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call indirect ontology or the ontology of the flesh of the world seen in his final and incomplete work The Visible and Invisible and his last published essay Eye and Mind.

Merleau-Ponty engaged with Marxism throughout his career. His 1947 book Humanism and Terror has been widely understood as a defence of the Soviet show trials. In fact this text avoids the definitive endorsement of a view on the Soviet Union but instead engages with the Marxist theory of history as a critique of liberalism in order to reveal an unresolved antinomy in modern politics between humanism and terror if human values can only be achieved through violent force and if liberal ideas hide illiberal realities how is just political action to be decided Merleau-Ponty maintained an engaged though critical relationship to the Marxist left until the end of his life particularly during his time as the political editor of the journal Les Temps Modernes.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty was born in 1908 in Rochefort-sur-Mer Charente-Inférieure France. His father died in 1913 when Merleau-Ponty was five years old. After secondary schooling at the lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris Merleau-Ponty became a student at the École Normale Supérieure where he studied alongside Jean-Paul Sartre Simone de Beauvoir Simone Weil Jean Hyppolite and Jean Wahl. As Beauvoir recounts in her autobiography she developed a close friendship with Merleau-Ponty and became smitten with him but ultimately found him too well-adjusted to bourgeois life and values for her taste. He attended Edmund Husserls Paris Lectures in February 1929. In 1929 Merleau-Ponty received his DES degree from the University of Paris on the basis of the thesis La Notion de multiple intelligible chez Plotin directed by Émile Bréhier. He passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1930.

Merleau-Ponty was raised as a Catholic. He was friends with the Christian existentialist Gabriel Marcel and he wrote articles for the Christian leftist journal Esprit but he left the Church in 1937 because he felt his socialist politics were not compatible with the social and political teaching of the Catholic Church.

An article published in French newspaper Le Monde in October 2014 makes the case of recent discoveries about Merleau-Pontys likely authorship of the novel Nord. Récit de larctique . Convergent sources from close friends seem to leave little doubt that Jacques Heller was a pseudonym of the 20-year-old Merleau-Ponty.

Merleau-Ponty taught first at the Lycée de Beauvais and then got a fellowship to do research from the Caisse nationale de la recherche scientifique. From 1934 to 1935 he taught at the Lycée de Chartres. He then in 1935 became a tutor at the École Normale Supérieure where he tutored a young Michel Foucault and Trần Đức Thảo and was awarded his doctorate on the basis of two important books La structure du comportement and Phénoménologie de la Perception . During this time he attended Alexandre Kojeves influential seminars on Hegel and Aron Gurwitschs lectures on Gestalt psychology.

In the spring of 1939 he was the first foreign visitor to the newly established Husserl Archives where he consulted Husserls unpublished manuscripts and met Eugen Fink and Father Hermann Van Breda. In the summer of 1939 as France entered war against Germany he served on the frontlines in the French army where he was wounded in battle in June 1940. Upon returning to Paris in the fall of 1940 he married Suzanne Jolibois a Lacanian psychoanalyst and founded an underground resistance group with Jean-Paul Sartre called Under the Boot. He participated in an armed demonstration against the Nazis during the Liberation of Paris.

After teaching at the University of Lyon from 1945 to 1948 Merleau-Ponty lectured on child psychology and education at the Sorbonne from 1949 to 1952. He was awarded the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France from 1952 until his death in 1961 making him the youngest person to have been elected to a chair.

Besides his teaching Merleau-Ponty was also political editor for the leftist Les Temps modernes from the founding of the journal in October 1945 until December 1952. In his youth he had read Karl Marxs writings and Sartre even claimed that Merleau-Ponty converted him to Marxism. While he was not a member of the French Communist Party and did not identify as a Communist he laid out an argument justifying the Soviet show trials and violence for progressive ends in general in the work Humanism and Terror in 1947. However about three years later he renounced his earlier support for political violence and he rejected Marxism and advocated a liberal left position in Adventures of the Dialectic . His friendship with Sartre and work with Les Temps modernes ended because of that since Sartre still had a more favourable attitude towards Soviet communism. Merleau-Ponty was subsequently active in the French non-communist left and in particular in the Union of the Democratic Forces.

Merleau-Ponty died suddenly of a stroke in 1961 at age 53 apparently while preparing for a class on René Descartes leaving an unfinished manuscript which was posthumously published in 1964 along with a selection of Merleau-Pontys working notes by Claude Lefort as The Visible and the Invisible. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with his mother Louise his wife Suzanne and their daughter Marianne.

In his Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty develops the concept of the body-subject as an alternative to the Cartesian cogito. This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness the world and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually engaged. The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and communing with the sensible qualities it encounters the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame through use of its pre-conscious pre-predicative understanding of the worlds makeup. The elaboration however is inexhaustible . Things are that upon which our body has a grip while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the worlds things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing becoming.

The essential partiality of our view of things their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality but on the contrary establishes it as there is no other way for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such Abschattungen . The thing transcends our view but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its backgroundto the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations each object reflects the other . Through involvement in the world being-in-the-world the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.

Each object is a mirror of all others. Our perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional or clearly delineated perception; rather it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the bodys primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscapes perceptual Gestalt. Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we turn our attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention however does not operate by clarifying what is already seen but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.

From the time of writing Structure of Behavior and Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wanted to show in opposition to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations. This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time particularly in behaviourism. According to Merleau-Ponty perception has an active dimension in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld .

This primordial openness is at the heart of his thesis of the primacy of perception. The slogan of Husserls phenomenology is all consciousness is consciousness of something which implies a distinction between acts of thought and intentional objects of thought . Thus the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution of analyses of consciousness. However in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl who remained one of his major influences Merleau-Ponty remarked that in their evolution Husserls work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesisnoema correlation. This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body subjective time and the other .

The distinction between acts of thought and intentional objects of thought does not seem therefore to constitute an irreducible ground. It appears rather at a higher level of analysis. Thus Merleau-Ponty does not postulate that all consciousness is consciousness of something which supposes at the outset a noetic-noematic ground. Instead he develops the thesis according to which all consciousness is perceptual consciousness. In doing so he establishes a significant turn in the development of phenomenology indicating that its conceptualisations should be re-examined in the light of the primacy of perception in weighing up the philosophical consequences of this thesis.

Taking the study of perception as his point of departure Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that ones own body is not only a thing a potential object of study for science but is also a permanent condition of experience a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines the fact that there is an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience so to speak insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.

Merleau-Ponty demonstrates a corporeity of consciousness as much as an intentionality of the body and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned despite the important differences that separate them. In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote Insofar as I have hands feet a body I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose .

The question concerning corporeity connects also with Merleau-Pontys reflections on space and the primacy of the dimension of depth as implied in the notion of being in the world and of ones own body . Reflections on spatiality in phenomenology are also central to the advanced philosophical deliberations in architectural theory.

The highlighting of the fact that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Pontys later works. Following this theme of expressivity he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject is in a position to undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body such as in intellectual operations and the products of ones cultural life.

He carefully considers language then as the core of culture by examining in particular the connections between the unfolding of thought and senseenriching his perspective not only by an analysis of the acquisition of language and the expressivity of the body but also by taking into account pathologies of language painting cinema literature poetry and song.

This work deals mainly with language beginning with the reflection on artistic expression in The Structure of Behaviorwhich contains a passage on El Greco that prefigures the remarks that he develops in Cézannes Doubt and follows the discussion in Phenomenology of Perception. The work undertaken while serving as the Chair of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of the Sorbonne is not a departure from his philosophical and phenomenological works but rather an important continuation in the development of his thought.

As the course outlines of his Sorbonne lectures indicate during this period he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology all in order to return to the study of the acquisition of language in children as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology linguistics and social anthropology.

Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression. This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language . Spoken language or secondary expression returns to our linguistic baggage to the cultural heritage that we have acquired as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language or primary expression such as it is is language in the production of a sense language at the advent of a thought at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.

It is speaking language that is to say primary expression that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action of intentionality of perception as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.

The notion of style occupies an important place in Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence. In spite of certain similarities with André Malraux Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style the last of which is employed in Malrauxs The Voices of Silence. Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work style is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense understood as a projection of the artists individuality. Sometimes it is used on the contrary in a very metaphysical sense in which style is connected with a conception of an über-artist expressing the Spirit of Painting. Finally it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. 

For Merleau-Ponty it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty it is important to consider the heart of this problematic by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. For Merleau-Ponty style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world of Nature.

In his essay Cézannes Doubt in which he identifies Paul Cézannes impressionistic theory of painting as analogous to his own concept of radical reflection the attempt to return to and reflect on prereflective consciousness Merleau-Ponty identifies science as the opposite of art. In Merleau-Pontys account whereas art is an attempt to capture an individuals perception science is anti-individualistic. In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism that it can tell us nothing about human subjectivity. All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist which cannot be transcended. For Merleau-Ponty science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.

Merleau-Ponty understood science to be an ex post facto abstraction. Causal and physiological accounts of perception for example explain perception in terms that are arrived at only after abstracting from the phenomenon itself. Merleau-Ponty chastised science for taking itself to be the area in which a complete account of nature may be given. The subjective depth of phenomena cannot be given in science as it is. This characterizes Merleau-Pontys attempt to ground science in phenomenological objectivity and in essence to institute a return to the phenomena.

Merleau-Pontys critical position with respect to science was stated in his Preface to the Phenomenology he described scientific points of view as always both naive and at the same time dishonest. Despite or perhaps because of this view his work influenced and anticipated the strands of modern psychology known as post-cognitivism. Hubert Dreyfus has been instrumental in emphasising the relevance of Merleau-Pontys work to current post-cognitive research and its criticism of the traditional view of cognitive science.

Dreyfuss seminal critique of cognitivism What Computers Cant Do consciously replays Merleau-Pontys critique of intellectualist psychology to argue for the irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfuss critique and neurophysiological alternative Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological connectionist accounts of cognition.

With the publication in 1991 of The Embodied Mind by Francisco Varela Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch this association was extended if only partially to another strand of anti-cognitivist or post-representationalist cognitive science embodied or enactive cognitive science and later in the decade to neurophenomenology. In addition Merleau-Pontys work has also influenced researchers trying to integrate neuroscience with the principles of chaos theory.

It was through this relationship with Merleau-Pontys work that cognitive sciences affair with phenomenology was born which is represented by a growing number of works including

Merleau-Ponty has also been picked up by Australian and Nordic philosophers inspired by the French feminist tradition including Rosalyn Diprose and Sara Heinämaa.

Heinämaa has argued for a rereading of Merleau-Pontys influence on Simone de Beauvoir. 

Merleau-Pontys phenomenology of the body has also been taken up by Iris Young in her essay Throwing Like a Girl and its follow-up Throwing Like a Girl Twenty Years Later. Young analyzes the particular modalities of feminine bodily comportment as they differ from that of men. Young observes that while a man who throws a ball puts his whole body into the motion a woman throwing a ball generally restricts her own movements as she makes them and that generally in sports women move in a more tentative reactive way. Merleau-Ponty argues that we experience the world in terms of the I can that is oriented towards certain projects based on our capacity and habituality. Youngs thesis is that in women this intentionality is inhibited and ambivalent rather than confident experienced as an I cannot.

Ecophenomenology can be described as the pursuit of the relationalities of worldly engagement both human and those of other creatures .

This engagement is situated in a kind of middle ground of relationality a space that is neither purely objective because it is reciprocally constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms nor purely subjective because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies. It is governed exclusively neither by causality nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.

David Abram explains Merleau-Pontys concept of flesh as the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality which Merleau-Ponty calls the flesh and which Abram refers to variously as the animate earth the breathing biosphere or the more-than-human natural world. Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as a complex set of objects and objective processes but rather the biosphere as it is experienced and lived from within by the intelligent body by the attentive human animal who is entirely a part of the world that he or she experiences. Merleau-Pontys ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of language; indeed he states that language is the very voice of the trees the waves and the forest.

Merleau-Ponty himself refers to that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection. From this primordial being to us there is no derivation nor any break... Among the many working notes found on his desk at the time of his death and published with the half-complete manuscript of The Visible and the Invisible several make it evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial flesh and a radically transformed understanding of nature. Hence in November 1960 he writes Do a psychoanalysis of Nature it is the flesh the mother. And in the last published working note written in March 1961 he writes Nature as the other side of humanity . This resonates with the conception of space place dwelling and embodiment especially as they are addressed against the background of the unfolding of the essence of modern technology. Such analytics figure in a Heideggerian take on econtology as an extension of Heideggers consideration of the question of being by way of the fourfold of earth-sky-mortals-divinities . In this strand of ecophenomenology ecology is co-entangled with ontology whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking.

The following table gives a selection of Merleau-Pontys works in French and English translation."
Marin Mersenne,"Marin Mersenne was a French polymath whose works touched a wide variety of fields. He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers those which can be written in the form Mn 2n 1 for some integer n. He also developed Mersennes laws which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string and his seminal work on music theory Harmonie universelle for which he is referred to as the father of acoustics. Mersenne an ordained Catholic priest had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s and because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas the post-box of Europe. He was also a member of the Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy.

Mersenne was born of Jeanne Moulière wife of Julien Mersenne peasants who lived near Oizé County of Maine . He was educated at Le Mans and at the Jesuit College of La Flèche. On 17 July 1611 he joined the Minim Friars and after studying theology and Hebrew in Paris was ordained a priest in 1613.

Between 1614 and 1618 he taught theology and philosophy at Nevers but he returned to Paris and settled at the convent of LAnnonciade in 1620. There he studied mathematics and music and met with other kindred spirits such as René Descartes Étienne Pascal Pierre Petit Gilles de Roberval Thomas Hobbes and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. He corresponded with Giovanni Doni Jacques Alexandre Le Tenneur Constantijn Huygens Galileo Galilei and other scholars in Italy England and the Dutch Republic. He was a staunch defender of Galileo assisting him in translations of some of his mechanical works.

For four years Mersenne devoted himself entirely to philosophic and theological writing and published Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim ; LImpieté des déistes ; La Vérité des sciences . It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he was a Jesuit. He was educated by Jesuits but he never joined the Society of Jesus. He taught theology and philosophy at Nevers and Paris.

In 1635 he set up the informal Académie Parisienne which had nearly 140 correspondents including astronomers and philosophers as well as mathematicians and was the precursor of the Académie des sciences established by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666. He was not afraid to cause disputes among his learned friends in order to compare their views notable among which were disputes between Descartes and Pierre de Fermat and Jean de Beaugrand.Peter L. Bernstein in his book Against the Gods The Remarkable Story of Risk wrote The Académie des Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London which were founded about twenty years after Mersennes death were direct descendants of Mersennes activities.

In 1635 Mersenne met with Tommaso Campanella but concluded that he could teach nothing in the sciences ... but still he has a good memory and a fertile imagination. Mersenne asked if Descartes wanted Campanella to come to Holland to meet him but Descartes declined. He visited Italy fifteen times in 1640 1641 and 1645. In 16431644 Mersenne also corresponded with the German Socinian Marcin Ruar concerning the Copernican ideas of Pierre Gassendi finding Ruar already a supporter of Gassendis position. Among his correspondents were Descartes Galileo Roberval Pascal Beeckman and other scientists.

He died on 1 September 1648 of complications arising from a lung abscess.

Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim was written as a commentary on the Book of Genesis and comprises uneven sections headed by verses from the first three chapters of that book. At first sight the book appears to be a collection of treatises on various miscellaneous topics. However Robert Lenoble has shown that the principle of unity in the work is a polemic against magical and divinatory arts cabalism and animistic and pantheistic philosophies. He mentions Martin Del Rios Investigations into Magic and criticises Marsilio Ficino for claiming power for images and characters. He condemns astral magic and astrology and the anima mundi a concept popular amongst Renaissance neo-platonists. Whilst allowing for a mystical interpretation of the Cabala he wholeheartedly condemned its magical application particularly angelology. He also criticises Pico della Mirandola Cornelius Agrippa Francesco Giorgio and Robert Fludd his main target. Fludd responded with Sophia cum moria certamen wherein he admits his involvement with the Rosicrucians. The anonymous Summum bonum another critique of Mersenne is an openly Rosicrucian text. The cabalist Jacques Gaffarel joined Fludds side while Pierre Gassendi defended Mersenne.

Harmonie universelle is perhaps Mersennes most influential work. It is one of the earliest comprehensive works on music theory touching on a wide range of musical concepts and especially the mathematical relationships involved in music. The work contains the earliest formulation of what has become known as Mersennes laws which describe the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string. This frequency is

In this book Mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts that can be considered the basis of modern reflecting telescopes

Because of criticism that he encountered especially from Descartes Mersenne made no attempt to build a telescope of his own.

Mersenne is also remembered today thanks to his association with the Mersenne primes. The Mersenne Twister named for Mersenne primes is frequently used in computer engineering and in related fields such as cryptography.

However Mersenne was not primarily a mathematician; he wrote about music theory and other subjects. He edited works of Euclid Apollonius Archimedes and other Greek mathematicians. But perhaps his most important contribution to the advance of learning was his extensive correspondence with mathematicians and other scientists in many countries. At a time when the scientific journal had not yet come into being Mersenne was the centre of a network for exchange of information.

It has been argued that Mersenne used his lack of mathematical specialty his ties to the print world his legal acumen and his friendship with the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes to manifest his international network of mathematicians.

Mersennes philosophical works are characterized by wide scholarship and the narrowest theological orthodoxy. His greatest service to philosophy was his enthusiastic defence of Descartes whose agent he was in Paris and whom he visited in exile in the Netherlands. He submitted to various eminent Parisian thinkers a manuscript copy of the Meditations on First Philosophy and defended its orthodoxy against numerous clerical critics.

In later life he gave up speculative thought and turned to scientific research especially in mathematics physics and astronomy. In this connection his best known work is Harmonie universelle of 1636 dealing with the theory of music and musical instruments. It is regarded as a source of information on 17th-century music especially French music and musicians to rival even the works of Pietro Cerone.

One of his many contributions to musical tuning theory was the suggestion of

He also performed extensive experiments to determine the acceleration of falling objects by comparing them with the swing of pendulums reported in his Cogitata Physico-Mathematica in 1644. He was the first to measure the length of the seconds pendulum that is a pendulum whose swing takes one second and the first to observe that a pendulums swings are not isochronous as Galileo thought but that large swings take longer than small swings.

Two German books which circulated around Europe in 1614-15 Fama fraternitatis and Confessio Fraternitatis claimed to be manifestos of a highly select secret society of alchemists and sages called the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians. The books were hoaxes but were obviously written by a small group who were reasonably knowledgeable about the sciences of the day and their main theme was to promote educational reform . However these books also promoted an occult view of science containing elements of Paracelsian philosophy neo-Platonism Cabalism and Hermeticism. In effect they sought to establish a new form of scientific religion with some pre-Christian elements.

Mersenne led the fight against acceptance of these ideas particularly those of Rosicrucian promoter Robert Fludd who had a lifelong battle of words with Johannes Kepler. The Rosicrucian ideas were defended by many prominent men of learning and some members of the European scholarly community boosted their own prestige by claiming to be among the selected members of the Brotherhood. However it is now generally agreed among historians that there is no evidence that the order of Rosicrucians ever existed.

During the mid-1630s Mersenne gave up the search for physical causes in the Aristotelian sense and taught that true physics could be only a descriptive science of motions which was the direction set by Galileo Galilei. Mersenne had been a regular correspondent with Galileo and had extended the work on vibrating strings originally developed by his father Vincenzo Galilei.

An air attributed to Mersenne was used by Ottorino Respighi in his second suite of Ancient Airs and Dances"
Jean Meslier,"Jean Meslier was a French Catholic priest who was discovered upon his death to have written a book-length philosophical essay promoting atheism and materialism. Described by the author as his testament to his parishioners the text criticizes and denounces all religions.

Jean Meslier was born in Mazerny in the Ardennes. He began learning Latin from a neighbourhood priest in 1678 and eventually joined the seminary; he later claimed in the Authors Preface to his Testament this was done to please his parents. At the end of his studies he took Holy Orders and on 7 January 1689 became priest at Étrépigny in Champagne.

One public disagreement with a local nobleman aside Meslier was to all appearances generally unremarkable. However he was twice reproved by clerical authorities for inappropriately employing young servant women whom the atheist and Meslier biographer Michel Onfray speculates he preyed upon sexually. Discreetly and secretly the curé had to practice the joy of free love advocated in his work writes Onfray. He lived like a pauper and every penny left over was donated to the poor.

When Meslier died in Étrépigny there were found in his house three copies of a 633-page octavo manuscript in which the village curate denounces organised religion as but a castle in the air and theology as but ignorance of natural causes reduced to a system.

In his Testament Meslier repudiated not only the God of conventional Christianity but even the generic God of the natural religion of the deists. For Meslier the existence of evil was incompatible with the idea of a good and wise God. He denied that any spiritual value could be gained from suffering and he used the deists argument from design against god by showing the evils that he had permitted in this world. To him religions were fabrications fostered by ruling elites; although the earliest Christians had been exemplary in sharing their goods Christianity had long since degenerated into encouraging the acceptance of suffering and submission to tyranny as practised by the kings of France injustice was explained away as being the will of an all-wise Being. None of the arguments used by Meslier against the existence of God were original. In fact he derived them from books written by orthodox theologians in the debate between the Jesuits Cartesians and Jansenists. Their inability to agree on a proof for Gods existence was taken by Meslier as a good reason not to presume that there were compelling grounds for belief in God.

Mesliers philosophy was that of an atheist. He also denied the existence of the soul and dismissed the notion of free will. In Chapter V the priest writes If God is incomprehensible to man it would seem rational never to think of Him at all. Meslier later describes God as a chimera and argues that the supposition of God is not prerequisite to morality. In fact he concludes that Whether there exists a God or not mens moral duties will always be the same so long as they possess their own nature.

In chapters XXXIII and XXXIV Meslier challenged Jesus mental health by implying that Jesus was really a madman a fanatic .

In his most famous quote Meslier refers to a man who wished that all the great men in the world and all the nobility could be hanged and strangled with the guts of the priests. Meslier admits that the statement may seem crude and shocking but comments that this is what the priests and nobility deserve not for reasons of revenge or hatred but for love of justice and truth.

Equally well-known is the version by Diderot And the guts of the last priest lets strangle the neck of the last king. During the political unrest of May 1968 the radical students of the Sorbonne Occupation Committee paraphrased Mesliers epigram stating that humanity wont be happy till the last capitalist is hung with the guts of the last bureaucrat.

Various edited abstracts of the Testament were printed and circulated condensing the multi-volume original manuscript and sometimes adding material that was not written by Meslier. Abstracts were popular because of the length and convoluted style of the original.

Voltaire often mentions Meslier in his correspondence in which he tells his daughter to read and read again Mesliers only work and says that every honest man should have Mesliers Testament in his pocket. However he also described Meslier as writing in the style of a carriage-horse.

Voltaire published his own expurgated version as Extraits des sentiments de Jean Meslier . Voltaires edition changed the thrust of Mesliers arguments so that he appeared to be a deistlike Voltairerather than an atheist.

The following passage is found at the end of Voltaires Extrait and has been cited in support of the view that Meslier was not really an atheist. However the passage does not appear in either the 1864 complete edition of the Testament published in Amsterdam by Rudolf Charles or in the complete works of Meslier published 19701972.

I will finish by begging God so outraged by that sect to deign to recall us to natural religion of which Christianity is the declared enemy. To that simple religion that God placed in the hearts of all men which teaches us that we only do unto others what we want to have done unto us. Then the universe will be composed of good citizens of just fathers of submissive children of tender friends. God gave us this religion in giving us reason. May fanaticism no longer pervert it I die more filled with these wishes than with hopes. This is the exact summary of the in-folio testament of Jean Meslier. We can judge how weighty is the testimony of a dying priest who asks Gods forgiveness.

Another book Good Sense published anonymously in 1772 was long attributed to Meslier but was in fact written by Baron dHolbach.

The complete Testament of Meslier was published in English translation for the first time in 2009.

In his book In Defense of Atheism the atheist philosopher Michel Onfray describes Meslier as the first person to write an entire text in support of atheism

For the first time in the history of ideas a philosopher had dedicated a whole book to the question of atheism. He professed it demonstrated it arguing and quoting sharing his reading and his reflections and seeking confirmation from his own observations of the everyday world. His title sets it out clearly Memoir of the Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier; and so does his subtitle Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World. The book appeared in 1729 after his death. Meslier had spent the greater part of his life working on it. The history of true atheism had begun.

Prior to announcing Meslier as the first atheist philosopher Onfray considers and dismisses Cristóvão Ferreira a Portuguese and former Jesuit who renounced his faith under Japanese torture in 1633 and went on to write a book titled The Deception Revealed. However Onfray decides that Ferreira was not such a good candidate as Meslier since Ferreira converted to Zen Buddhism.

The Situationist cultural theorist Raoul Vaneigem praised Mesliers resistance to hierarchical authority claiming that the last full-fledged exemplars of priests genuinely loyal to the revolutionary origins of their religion were Jean Meslier and Jacques Roux fomenting jacquerie and riot.

According to Colin Brewer who co-produced a play about Mesliers life

Historians argue about who was the first overt post-Classical atheist but Meslier was arguably the first to put his name to an incontrovertibly atheist document. That this important event is largely unrecognised is due partly to Voltaire who published in 1761 a grossly distorted Extract that portrayed Meslier as a fellow-deist and entirely suppressed Mesliers anti-monarchist proto-communist opinions."
Régis Messac,Régis Messac was a French essayist poet and translator.
Émile Meyerson,"Meyerson was educated at the University of Heidelberg and studied chemistry under Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. In 1882 Meyerson settled in Paris. He served as foreign editor of the Havas news agency and later as the director of the Jewish Colonization Association for Europe and Asia Minor. He became a naturalized French citizen after World War I.

Thomas Kuhn cites Meyersons work as influential while developing the ideas for his main work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

In La Déduction relativiste Meyerson expressed the view that Einsteins general theory of relativity was a new version of the identification of matter with space which he considered the postulate upon which the whole system rests."
Gaston Milhaud,"Gaston Milhaud was a French philosopher and historian of science.

Gaston Milhaud studied mathematics with Gaston Darboux at the École Normale Supérieure. In 1881 he took a teaching post at the University of Le Havre. In 1891 he became professor of mathematics at Montpellier University and in 1895 became professor of philosophy there. In 1909 a chair in the history of philosophy in its relationship to the sciences was created for him at the Sorbonne. Milhauds successor in the chair was Abel Rey."
Jean-Claude Milner,"Jean-Claude Milner is a linguist philosopher and essayist. His specialist fields of endeavour are linguistics and psychoanalysis . In 1971 Milner was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he translated Noam Chomskys Aspects of the Theory of Syntax into French. His work helped to establish the terminology of theory of syntax in the French school of generative grammar. Milner is now a professor at the University Paris Diderot and lives in Paris.

Milner who was born in Paris is the son of a Lithuanian immigrant Jewish father and an Alsatian mother of the Protestant faith. After studies in a second year preparatory class for the humanities during high school Milner studied at both École Normale Supérieure and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His education was shaped by the thought and teaching of Louis Althusser and Jacques Lacan. Lacans influence may also be tied to his friendship with Jacques-Alain Miller during these early years. Miller became subsequently the son-in-law of Lacan. Both Miller and Milner attended Lacans seminars held at the ENS and their friendship was instrumental in the founding and direction of the Cahiers pour lAnalyse several years later.

From 1968 to 1971 Milner was affiliated with the Maoist movement of the proletarian Left and discovered the path of his own political evolution. Milner seems to have disavowed or moved away from these early affiliations. Alain Badiou who has remained steadfast in his Maoist affiliations has engaged in a long-standing contretemps with Milner over these changing affiliations . Milner also received training and education from Roland Barthes and made a close reading of Roman Jakobson.

After his initial association with Chomskys linguistic theories Milners work took a different turn. He published Introduction to a Science of Language which melds a general linguistics theory that rests on a radical separation between sense and syntax together with an epistemology that combines concepts of Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos. This work tackles a key epistemological problem of the scientific status of Lacans theories. Milner also follows developments of Chomskyian theory though he does not adhere to the hypothesis of a biological justification for it which Chomsky defended.

Milners later work such as the English publication of For the Love of Language has been called

Since 2000 particularly in France Milner has been recognised for his essays concerning anti-Semitism in European history and culture. For several years he has held a seminar devoted to this theme at the Institut détudes levinassiennes in Paris.

In 2010 Milner became Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at the Université de Paris VII."
"Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau","Victor de Riqueti Marquis de Mirabeau was a French economist of the Physiocratic school. He was the father of Honoré Comte de Mirabeau and André Boniface Louis Riqueti de Mirabeau. He was in distinction often referred to as the elder Mirabeau as he had a younger brother Jean-Antoine Riqueti de Mirabeau .

Mirabeau was brought up very sternly by his father and in 1728 joined the army. He took keenly to campaigning but never rose above the rank of captain owing to his being unable to get leave at court to buy a regiment. In 1737 he came into the family property on his fathers death and spent some pleasant years till 1743 in literary companionship with Luc de Clapiers marquis de Vauvenargues and the poet Lefranc de Pompignan which might have continued had he not determined to marry not for money but for landed estates. The lady whose property he fancied was Marie-Geneviève daughter of a M. de Vassan a brigadier in the army and widow of the marquis de Saulveboef whom he married without previously seeing her on 21 April 1743. In the same year Mirabeau was made a Knight of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis.

The event that led Mirabeau to devote himself to political economy was undoubtedly his work on a manuscript of Richard Cantillons Essai sur la nature du commerce en général which he had in his possession as early as 1740. He elaborated a commentary of this text that gradually became what became his Ami des hommes.

While in garrison at Bordeaux Mirabeau had made the acquaintance of Montesquieu and after retiring from the army he wrote his first work his Testament Politique which demanded for the prosperity of France a return of the French noblesse to their old position in the Middle Ages. in 1749 his son Honoré Gabriel was born. This work was followed in 1750 by a book on the Utilité des états provinciaux which was attributed to Montesquieu himself. In 1756 Mirabeau made his first appearance as a political economist by the publication of his LAmi des hommes ou Traité de la population . This work has been often attributed to the influence and in part even to the pen of Quesnay the founder of the economical school of the physiocrats but was really written before the marquis had made the acquaintance of the physician of Madame de Pompadour.

In 1760 he published his Théorie de limpot in which he attacked with all the vehemence of his son the farmers-general of the taxes who got him imprisoned for eight days at Vincennes and then exiled to his country estate at Bignon near Nemours. At Bignon the school of the physiocrats was really established and the marquis in 1765 bought the Journal de lagriculture du commerce et des finances which became the organ of the school. He was recognized as a leader of political thinkers by Prince Leopold of Tuscany afterwards emperor and by Gustav III of Sweden who in 1772 sent him the Grand Cross of the Order of Vasa.

But his marriage had not been happy; he had separated from his wife in 1762 and had he believed secured her safely in the provinces by a lettre de cachet when in 1772 she suddenly appeared in Paris and commenced proceedings for a separation. One of his own daughters had encouraged his wife to take this step. He was determined to keep the case quiet if possible for the sake of Mme de Pailly a Swiss lady whom he had loved since 1756. But his wife would not let him rest; her plea was rejected in 1777 but she renewed her suit and though Honoré had pleaded his fathers case was successful in 1781. This trial quite broke the health of the marquis as well as his fortune; he sold his estate at Bignon and hired a house at Argenteuil where he lived quietly till his death.

The marquiss younger brother Jean Antoine Riquetti the bailli served with distinction in the navy but his brusque manners made success at court impossible. In 1763 he became general of the galleys of Malta. In 1767 he returned to France and took charge of the château de Mirabeau helping the marquis in his disastrous lawsuits.

Mirabeau was nicknamed Friend of Man after his work LAmi des Hommes."
Robert Misrahi,"Robert Misrahi is a French philosopher who specialises in the work of 17th Century Dutch thinker Baruch Spinoza.

Born in Paris to Turkish-Jewish immigrants Misrahi studied at the University of Paris where he became a protege of Jean-Paul Sartre. He is currently the emeritus professor of ethical philosophy at the Université de Paris I he has published a number of works on Spinoza and published the essentials of his work on the question of happiness. He has published a number of works in publications including Les Temps modernes Encyclopædia Universalis Le Dictionnaire des philosophies PUF but also Libération and le Nouvel Observateur.

In 1974 he was the doctoral advisor of future UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Sérgio Vieira de Mello. 

In November 2002 he published a polemic in the columns of Charlie Hebdo regarding a book by controversial Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci la Rage et lOrgueil. 

During his studies at the Sorbonne Misrahi also became involved with the militant Zionist group Lehi which was then conducting an insurgency in Palestine against the British. Misrahi was recruited to carry out an attack on British soil. During a March 1947 visit to London Misrahi placed a bomb in the Colonial Club a recreational facility for students and soldiers from British colonies in Africa and the West Indies. The bomb which detonated on March 7 1947 blew out the facilitys doors and windows and seriously injured several soldiers."
Michel de Montaigne,"Michel Eyquem de Montaigne also known as Lord of Montaigne was one of the most significant philosophers of the French Renaissance. He is known for popularizing the essay as a literary genre. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes and autobiography with intellectual insight. His massive volume Essais contains some of the most influential essays ever written.

Montaigne had a direct influence on Western writers including Francis Bacon René DescartesBlaise Pascal Montesquieu Edmund Burke Joseph De Maistre Voltaire Jean-Jacques Rousseau David Hume Edward Gibbon Virginia Woolf Albert Hirschman William HazlittRalph Waldo Emerson Jean Meslier John Henry Newman Karl Marx Sigmund Freud Alexander Pushkin Charles Darwin Friedrich Nietzsche Stefan Zweig Eric HofferIsaac Asimov Fulton Sheen Albert Camus and on the later works of William Shakespeare.

During his lifetime Montaigne was admired more as a statesman than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation and his declaration that I am myself the matter of my book was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time however Montaigne came to be recognized as embodying perhaps better than any other author of his time the spirit of freely entertaining doubt that began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his skeptical remark Que sçay-je .

Montaigne was born in the Aquitaine region of France on the family estate Château de Montaigne in a town now called Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne close to Bordeaux. The family was very wealthy; his great-grandfather Ramon Felipe Eyquem had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477 thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father Pierre Eyquem Seigneur of Montaigne was a French Catholic soldier in Italy for a time and had also been the mayor of Bordeaux.

Although there were several families bearing the patronym Eyquem in Guyenne his fathers family is thought to have had some degree of Marrano origins while his mother Antoinette López de Villanueva was a convert to Protestantism. His maternal grandfather Pedro Lopez from Zaragoza was from a wealthy Marrano family that had converted to Catholicism. His maternal grandmother Honorette Dupuy was from a Catholic family in Gascony France.

During a great part of Montaignes life his mother lived near him and even survived him but she is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaignes relationship with his father however is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.

Montaignes education began in early childhood and followed a pedagogical plan that his father had developed refined by the advice of the latters humanist friends. Soon after his birth Montaigne was brought to a small cottage where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family in order to according to the elder Montaigne draw the boy close to the people and to the life conditions of the people who need our help. After these first spartan years Montaigne was brought back to the château. Another objective was for Latin to become his first language.

The intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor . His father hired only servants who could speak Latin and they also were given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother father and servants who were obliged to use only Latin words he employed and thus they acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaignes Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games conversation and exercises of solitary meditation rather than the more traditional books.

The atmosphere of the boys upbringing although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father created in the boys life the spirit of liberty and delight that he later would describe as making him relish... duty by an unforced will and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint; yet he would have everything to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning playing one instrument or another and an épinettier was the constant companion to Montaigne and his tutor playing tunes to alleviate boredom and tiredness.

Around the year 1539 Montaigne was sent to study at a highly regarded boarding school in Bordeaux the College of Guienne then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era George Buchanan where he mastered the whole curriculum by his thirteenth year. He finished the first phase of his educational studies at the College of Guienne in 1546. He then began his study of law and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of Périgueux and in 1557 he was appointed counselor of the Parlement in Bordeaux a high court. From 1561 to 1563 he was courtier at the court of Charles IX and he was present with the king at the siege of Rouen . He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility the collar of the Order of Saint Michael something to which he had aspired from his youth.

While serving at the Bordeaux Parlement he became a very close friend of the humanist poet Étienne de La Boétie whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame in his introduction to The Complete Essays of Montaigne that because of Montaignes imperious need to communicate after losing Étienne he began the Essais as a new means of communication and that the reader takes the place of the dead friend.

Montaigne married Françoise de la Cassaigne in 1565 probably in an arranged marriage. She was the daughter and niece of wealthy merchants of Toulouse and Bordeaux. They had six daughters but only the second-born Léonor survived infancy. Little is known about their marriage he wrote very little about their relationship however he did write about his daughter Léonor All my children die at nurse; but Léonore our only daughter who has escaped this misfortune has reached the age of six and more without having been punished the indulgence of her mother aiding except in words and those very gentle ones. His daughter married François de la Tour and later Charles de Gamaches. She had a daughter by each.

Following the petition of his father Montaigne started to work on the first translation of the Catalan monk Raymond Sebonds Theologia naturalis which he published a year after his fathers death in 1568 . After this he inherited the familys estate the Château de Montaigne to which he moved back in 1570; he thus became the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaignes posthumous edition of the works of his friend Boétie.

Château de Montaigne a house built on the land once owned by Montaignes family; his original family home no longer exists although the tower in which he wrote still stands

The Tour de Montaigne where Montaignes library was located remains mostly unchanged since the sixteenth century

In 1571 he retired from public life to the Tower of the château his so-called citadel in the Dordogne where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library which contained a collection of some 1500 works he began work on his Essais first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion he had the following inscription placed on the crown of the bookshelves of his working chamber

In the year of Christ 1571 at the age of thirty-eight on the last day of February his birthday Michael de Montaigne long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments while still entire retired to the bosom of the learned virgins where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life now more than half run out. If the fates permit he will complete this abode this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom tranquility and leisure.

During this time of the Wars of Religion in France Montaigne a Roman Catholic acted as a moderating force respected both by the Catholic King Henry III and the Protestant Henry of Navarre.

In 1578 Montaigne whose health had always been excellent started suffering from painful kidney stones a tendency he inherited from his fathers family. Throughout this illness he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs. From 1580 to 1581 Montaigne traveled in France Germany Austria Switzerland and Italy partly in search of a cure establishing himself at Bagni di Lucca where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the Holy House of Loreto to which he presented a silver relief depicting him his wife and their daughter kneeling before the Madonna considering himself fortunate that it should be hung on a wall within the shrine. He kept a journal recording regional differences and customs and a variety of personal episodes including the dimensions of the stones he succeeded in expelling. This was published much later in 1774 after its discovery in a trunk that is displayed in his tower.

During a visit to the Vatican that Montaigne described in his travel journal the Essais were examined by Sisto Fabri who served as Master of the Sacred Palace under Pope Gregory XIII. After Fabri examined Montaignes Essais the text was returned to him on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of fortuna as well as for writing favorably of Julian the Apostate and of heretical poets and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.

While in the city of Lucca in 1581 he learned that like his father before him he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux. He thus returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585 again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The plague broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office in 1585. In 1586 the plague and the French Wars of Religion prompted him to leave his château for two years.

Montaigne continued to extend revise and oversee the publication of the Essais. In 1588 he wrote its third book and also met Marie de Gournay an author who admired his work and later edited and published it. Montaigne later referred to her as his adopted daughter. King Henry III was assassinated in 1589 and Montaigne then helped to keep Bordeaux loyal to Henry of Navarre who would go on to become King Henry IV.

Montaigne died of quinsy at the age of 59 in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. In his case the disease brought about paralysis of the tongue especially difficult for one who once said the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice. Remaining in possession of all his other faculties he requested Mass and died during the celebration of that Mass.

He was buried nearby. Later his remains were moved to the church of Saint Antoine at Bordeaux. The church no longer exists it became the Convent des Feuillants which also has disappeared. The Bordeaux Tourist Office says that Montaigne is buried at the Musée Aquitaine Faculté des Lettres Université Bordeaux 3 Michel de Montaigne Pessac. His heart is preserved in the parish church of Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne.

The humanities branch of the University of Bordeaux is named after him Université Michel de Montaigne Bordeaux 3.

His humanism finds expression in his Essais a collection of a large number of short subjective essays on various topics published in 1580 that were inspired by his studies in the classics especially by the works of Plutarch and Lucretius. Montaignes stated goal was to describe humans and especially himself with utter frankness. Montaignes writings are studied as literature and philosophy around the world.

Inspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time. He believed that humans are not able to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays Apology for Raymond Sebond marking his adoption of Pyrrhonism contains his famous motto What do I know

Montaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children but disliked strong feelings of passionate love because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge intended to be accepted uncritically. His essay On the Education of Children is dedicated to Diana of Foix.

The Essais exercised an important influence on both French and English literature in thought and style.Francis Bacons Essays published over a decade later first in 1597 usually are presumed to be directly influenced by Montaignes collection and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.

Although not a scientist Montaigne made observations on topics in psychology. In his essays he developed and explained his observations of these topics. His thoughts and ideas covered topics such as thought motivation fear happiness child education experience and human action. Montaignes ideas have influenced psychology and are a part of its rich history.

Child education was among the psychological topics that he wrote about. His essays On the Education of Children On Pedantry and On Experience explain the views he had on child education. Some of his views on child education are still relevant today.

Montaignes views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day. He found fault both with what was taught and how it was taught. Much of the education during Montaignes time was focused on the reading of the classics and learning through books.Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that to learn truly a student had to take the information and make it their own.

At the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated. Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student.He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.

Individualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things.He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a childs curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.

Experience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice travel and human interaction. In doing so he argued that students would become active learners who could claim knowledge for themselves.

Montaignes views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaignes ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience over book learning and memorization. Ultimately Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.

Thinkers exploring ideas similar to Montaigne include Erasmus Thomas More John Fisher and Guillaume Budé who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne. Many of Montaignes Latin quotations are from Erasmus Adagia and most critically all of his quotations from Socrates. Plutarch remains perhaps Montaignes strongest influence in terms of substance and style. Montaignes quotations from Plutarch in the Essays number more than 500.

Ever since Edward Capell first made the suggestion in 1780 scholars have suggested Montaigne to be an influence on Shakespeare. The latter would have had access to John Florios translation of Montaignes Essais published in English in 1603 and a scene in The Tempest follows the wording of Florio so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable.Most parallels between the two may be explained however as commonplaces as similarities with writers in other nations to the works of Cervantes and Shakespeare could be due simply to their own study of Latin moral and philosophical writers such as Seneca the Younger Horace Ovid and Virgil.

Much of Blaise Pascals skepticism in his Pensées has been attributed traditionally to his reading Montaigne.

The English essayist William Hazlitt expressed boundless admiration for Montaigne exclaiming that he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot. ... In treating of men and manners he spoke of them as he found them not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas. Beginning most overtly with the essays in the familiar style in his own Table-Talk Hazlitt tried to follow Montaignes example.

Ralph Waldo Emerson chose Montaigne; or the Skeptic as a subject of one of his series of lectures entitled Representative Men alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In The Skeptic Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book in some former life so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience. Friedrich Nietzsche judged of Montaigne That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth.Sainte-Beuve advises us that to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments let us read every evening a page of Montaigne.

The American philosopher Eric Hoffer employed Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffers memoir Truth Imagined he said of Montaigne He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts. The British novelist John Cowper Powys expressed his admiration for Montaignes philosophy in his books Suspended Judgements and The Pleasures of Literature . Judith N. Shklar introduces her book Ordinary Vices It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages...

Twentieth-century literary critic Erich Auerbach called Montaigne the first modern man. Among all his contemporaries writes Auerbach he had the clearest conception of the problem of mans self-orientation; that is the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support.

The Musée dAquitaine announced on 20 November 2019 that the human remains which had been found in the basement of the museum a year earlier might belong to Montaigne. Investigation of the remains postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic resumed in September 2020.

The birthdate of Montaigne served as the basis to establish National Essay Day in the USA."
Charles Forbes René de Montalembert,"Charles Forbes René de Montalembert was a French publicist historian and Count of Montalembert Deux-Sèvres and a prominent representative of Liberal Catholicism.

Charles Forbes René de Montalembert who was born on 15 April 1810 was of French and Scots ancestry. His father Marc René belonged to the family of Angoumois which could trace its descent back to the 13th century while charters show the history of the house even two centuries earlier. For several generations the family had been distinguished both in the army and in the field of science. Montalembert senior had fought under Condé and subsequently served in the British army. He married Eliza Rose Forbes whose father James Forbes belonged to a very old Scottish Protestant family. Charles their eldest son was born in London. At the French Restoration of 1814 Marc René returned to France was raised to the peerage in 1820 and became ambassador to Sweden where Charles completed his education in 1826.

Montalemberts early years were spent in England where he was largely raised by his grandfather who although a Protestant encouraged him to follow the religion of his father. In 1819 he attended the Lycée Bourbon and at the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris. In 1829 he was a contributor to the review Le Correspondant. In September and October 1830 he travelled in Ireland where he met Daniel OConnell; he was thinking of assisting the cause for which OConnell was struggling by writing a history of Ireland when he learned that the House of Commons had passed the Irish Emancipation Act.

Charles de Montalembert was under twenty-five at his fathers death in 1831 and therefore too young to take his seat as a peer but he retained other rights. Combined with his literary and intellectual activity this made him a person of some importance. He was a Liberal in the English sense and disagreed with the new regime on only the religious question. He would have approved of the policy of the golden mean represented by Louis Philippe. He wished to see the Church free from state control and attacked the monopoly of public instruction by which the monarchy fortified its position. This latter scheme first brought Montalembert to public attention when he was formally charged with unlicensed teaching. He claimed the right of trial by his peers and made a notable defence with a deliberate intention of protest in 1832.

On the other hand he thought that the Church should not obstinately oppose new ideas. He had eagerly entered into the plans of his friends Lamennais and Lacordaire and he collaborated with them in the newspaper LAvenir . He especially distinguished himself in LAvenir by his campaigns in favour of freedom for Ireland and Poland and for these he received the congratulations of Victor Hugo and Alfred de Vigny. In 1831 he thought of going to Poland and joining the insurgents there. He was instrumental in setting up the Polish Library in Paris and its associated literary society for the Great Emigration into France.

The Ultramontane party was roused by the boldness of Montalembert and his two friends who then left for Rome. They failed to win any mitigation of the measures which the Roman curia took against LAvenir. Its doctrines were condemned in two encyclicals Mirari vos in 1832 and Singulari Nos in 1834 and Montalembert submitted. In 1835 he took his seat in the Chamber of Peers and his competence soon made him famous. He clung to his early liberalism and in 1848 saw the end of a government towards which he had always been hostile. In 1848 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. He was at first inclined to support Napoleon III but was soon alienated by his policy. Montalembert remained in the Chamber until 1857 when he was obliged to retire to private life. He was still recognised as a formidable opponent of the Empire. Meanwhile his Liberal ideas had made him some irreconcilable enemies among the Ultramontanists. Louis Veuillot in his paper LUnivers religieux opposed him. In 1855 Montalembert answered them by reviving a review which had for some time ceased publication Le Correspondant. This he used to fight the party of Veuillot and the far-left Liberals of the Revue des deux mondes.

At a noted Catholic congress in Malines Belgium in 1863 Montalembert gave two long addresses on Catholic Liberalism. He was also a staunch supporter of the independence of education from the state

I do not want to be constrained by the state to believe what it believes to be true because the State is not the judge of truth. However the State is bound to protect me in the practice of the truth that I choose that is to say the exercise of the religion that I profess This is what constitutes religious freedom in the modern state which the free state is bound to respect and guarantee not only for each citizen in particular but for groups of citizens joined together to profess and propagate their belief that is to say for corporation for associations and for churches.

He took great interest in the débuts of the Liberal empire. He severed his connection with Père Hyacinthe Loyson as he had with Lamennais and made the submission expected of him to the Council. It was his last fall. Montalembert became increasingly isolated politically for his support of religious freedom in education; and by the Church for his liberal views.

Montalembert married Mlle de Merode daughter of Félix de Mérode. His daughter married the vicomte de Meaux a Roman Catholic statesman and distinguished writer. He was thus the brother-in-law of Belgian prelate and papal statesman Xavier de Mérode.

Montalembert was a close friend of Edwin Wyndham-Quin 3rd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl with whom he toured Scotland in 1862 staying at Dunraven Castle on his return journey. The viscount travelled with Montalembert to Switzerland the following year and stayed at Maîche Doubs on his return.

In addition to being an eloquent orator Montalembert wrote in a style at once picturesque fiery and polished. He was an ardent student of the Middle Ages but his medieval enthusiasm was strongly tinctured with religious sentiments. His first historical work La Vie de Ste Elisabeth de Hongrie is not so much a history as a religious manifesto which did much to restore the position of hagiography. It met with great success but Montalembert was not elected a member of the Académie française until 1851 after the fall of the July monarchy.

From this time he gave much of his attention to a great work on monasticism in the West. He was at first attracted by the figure of St. Bernard and devoted one volume to him. He later withdrew it on the advice of his friend Dupanloup and the entire printing was destroyed. He then enlarged his original plan and published the first volumes of his Moines doccident an eloquent work which was received with much admiration in those circles where language was more appreciated than learning. The work unfinished at the time of the authors death was completed later from some long fragments found among his papers. Volumes VI and VII appeared in 1877.

Like Chateaubriand he kept a close record of acquaintances invitations necrology."
Montesquieu,"Charles-Louis de Secondat Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu generally referred to as simply Montesquieu was a French judge man of letters historian and political philosopher.

He is the principal source of the theory of separation of powers which is implemented in many constitutions throughout the world. He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word despotism in the political lexicon. His anonymously published The Spirit of the Laws which was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in drafting the U.S. Constitution.

Montesquieu was born at the Château de la Brède in southwest France 25 kilometres south of Bordeaux. His father Jacques de Secondat was a soldier with a long noble ancestry including descent from Richard de la Pole Yorkist claimant to the English crown. His mother Marie Françoise de Pesnel who died when Charles was seven was an heiress who brought the title of Barony of La Brède to the Secondat family. After the death of his mother he was sent to the Catholic College of Juilly a prominent school for the children of French nobility where he remained from 1700 to 1711. His father died in 1713 and he became a ward of his uncle the Baron de Montesquieu. He became a counselor of the Bordeaux Parlement in 1714. The next year he married the Protestant Jeanne de Lartigue who eventually bore him three children. The Baron died in 1716 leaving him his fortune as well as his title and the office of président à mortier in the Bordeaux Parlement a post that he would hold for twelve years.

Montesquieus early life occurred at a time of significant governmental change. England had declared itself a constitutional monarchy in the wake of its Glorious Revolution and had joined with Scotland in the Union of 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In France the long-reigning Louis XIV died in 1715 and was succeeded by the five-year-old Louis XV. These national transformations had a great impact on Montesquieu; he would refer to them repeatedly in his work.

Montesquieu withdrew from the practice of law to devote himself to study and writing. He achieved literary success with the publication of his 1721 Persian Letters a satire representing society as seen through the eyes of two imaginary Persian visitors to Paris and Europe cleverly criticizing the absurdities of contemporary French society. The work went through four editions within a year but the vogue for such work quickly passed. In 1722 he went to Paris and entered court circles with the help of Duke of Berwick whom he had known when Berwick was military governor at Bordeaux. He also acquainted himself with the English politician Viscount Bolingbroke whose political views were later incorporated into Montesquieus analysis of English constitution. However he was passed over for membership in the Académie Française on the technicality of his not living in Paris and in 1726 he sold his office due to his resentment that his intellectual inferiors rose higher than him in court and received a fortune thus reestablishing his dwindled asset. Eventually he made some concessions including a residence in Paris and was accepted into the Academie in January 1728.

In April 1728 with Berwicks nephew Lord Waldegrave as his traveling companion Montesquieu embarked on a grand tour of Europe during which he kept a journal. His travels included Austria and Hungary and a year in Italy. He went to England at the end of October 1729 in the company of Lord Chesterfield where he became a freemason admitted to the Horn Tavern Lodge in Westminster. He remained in England until the spring of 1731 when he returned to La Brède. Outwardly he seemed to be settling down as a squire he altered his park in the English fashion made inquiries into his own genealogy and asserted his seignorial rights. But he was continuously at work in his study and his reflections on geography laws and customs during his travels became the primary sources for his major works on political philosophy at this time. He next published Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline among his three best known books. It is considered by some scholars as a transition from The Persian Letters to his master work The Spirit of the Laws which was originally published anonymously in 1748 and translated into English in 1750. It quickly rose to influence political thought profoundly in Europe and America. In France the book met with an unfriendly reception from both supporters and opponents of the regime. The Catholic Church banned The Spiritalong with many of Montesquieus other worksin 1751 and included it on the Index of Prohibited Books. It received the highest praise from the rest of Europe especially Britain.

Montesquieu was also highly regarded in the British colonies in North America as a champion of liberty . According to one political scientist he was the most frequently quoted authority on government and politics in colonial pre-revolutionary British America cited more by the American founders than any source except for the Bible. Following the American Revolution Montesquieus work remained a powerful influence on many of the American founders most notably James Madison of Virginia the Father of the Constitution. Montesquieus philosophy that government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another reminded Madison and others that a free and stable foundation for their new national government required a clearly defined and balanced separation of powers.

Montesquieu was troubled by poor eyesight and was completely blind by the end of his life. At the end of 1754 he visited Paris with the intention of getting rid of the lease of his house there and finally retiring to La Brède. He was however soon taken ill and died from a high fever on 10 February 1755. He was buried in the Église Saint-Sulpice Paris and the Revolution obliterated all trace of his remains.

Montesquieus philosophy of history minimized the role of individual persons and events. He expounded the view in Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline that each historical event was driven by a principal movement

It is not chance that rules the world. Ask the Romans who had a continuous sequence of successes when they were guided by a certain plan and an uninterrupted sequence of reverses when they followed another. There are general causes moral and physical which act in every monarchy elevating it maintaining it or hurling it to the ground. All accidents are controlled by these causes. And if the chance of one battle that is a particular cause has brought a state to ruin some general cause made it necessary for that state to perish from a single battle. In a word the main trend draws with it all particular accidents.

In discussing the transition from the Republic to the Empire he suggested that if Caesar and Pompey had not worked to usurp the government of the Republic other men would have risen in their place. The cause was not the ambition of Caesar or Pompey but the ambition of man.

Montesquieu is credited as being among the progenitors which include Herodotus and Tacitus of anthropology as being among the first to extend comparative methods of classification to the political forms in human societies. Indeed the French political anthropologist Georges Balandier considered Montesquieu to be the initiator of a scientific enterprise that for a time performed the role of cultural and social anthropology. According to social anthropologist D. F. Pocock Montesquieus The Spirit of the Laws was the first consistent attempt to survey the varieties of human society to classify and compare them and within society to study the inter-functioning of institutions. Montesquieus political anthropology gave rise to his theories on government. When Catherine the Great wrote her Nakaz for the Legislative Assembly she had created to clarify the existing Russian law code she avowed borrowing heavily from Montesquieus Spirit of Law although she discarded or altered portions that did not support Russias absolutist bureaucratic monarchy.

Montesquieus most influential work divided French society into three classes the monarchy the aristocracy and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing the sovereign and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive the legislative and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it eliminated the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy the clergy the aristocracy and the people at large represented by the Estates-General thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.

The theory of the separation of powers largely derives from The Spirit of the Laws

In every government there are three sorts of power the legislative; the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations; and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law.

By virtue of the first the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted. By the second he makes peace or war sends or receives embassies establishes the public security and provides against invasions. By the third he punishes criminals or determines the disputes that arise between individuals. The latter we shall call the judiciary power and the other simply the executive power of the state.

Montesquieu argues that each Power should only exercise its own functions; it was quite explicit here

When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or in the same body of magistrates there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner.

Again there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power the judge might behave with violence and oppression.

There would be an end of every thing were the same man or the same body whether of the nobles or of the people to exercise those three powers that of enacting laws that of executing the public resolutions and of trying the causes of individuals.

If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers as Montesquieu indicated there will be no separation or division of its powers since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.

The executive power ought to be in the hands of a monarch because this branch of government having need of dispatch is better administered by one than by many on the other hand whatever depends on the legislative power is oftentimes better regulated by many than by a single person.

But if there were no monarch and the executive power should be committed to a certain number of persons selected from the legislative body there would be an end of liberty since the two powers would be united; as the same persons would sometimes possess and would be always able to possess a share in both.

Likewise there were three main forms of government each supported by a social principle monarchies which rely on the principle of honor; republics which rely on the principle of virtue; and despotisms which rely on fear. The free governments are dependent on fragile constitutional arrangements. Montesquieu devotes four chapters of The Spirit of the Laws to a discussion of England a contemporary free government where liberty was sustained by a balance of powers. Montesquieu worried that in France the intermediate powers which moderated the power of the prince were being eroded. These ideas of the control of power were often used in the thinking of Maximilien Robespierre.

Montesquieu advocated reform of slavery in The Spirit of the Laws specifically arguing that slavery was inherently wrong because all humans are born equal but that it could perhaps be justified within the context of climates with intense heat wherein laborers would feel less inclined to work voluntarily. As part of his advocacy he presented a satirical hypothetical list of arguments for slavery. In the hypothetical list hed ironically list pro-slavery arguments without further comment including an argument stating that sugar would become too expensive without the free labor of slaves.

While addressing French readers of his General Theory John Maynard Keynes described Montesquieu as the real French equivalent of Adam Smith the greatest of your economists head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration clear-headedness and good sense .

Another example of Montesquieus anthropological thinking outlined in The Spirit of the Laws and hinted at in Persian Letters is his meteorological climate theory which holds that climate may substantially influence the nature of man and his society. By placing an emphasis on environmental influences as a material condition of life Montesquieu prefigured modern anthropologys concern with the impact of material conditions such as available energy sources organized production systems and technologies on the growth of complex socio-cultural systems.

He goes so far as to assert that certain climates are superior to others the temperate climate of France being ideal. His view is that people living in very warm countries are too hot-tempered while those in northern countries are icy or stiff. The climate of middle Europe is therefore optimal. On this point Montesquieu may well have been influenced by a similar pronouncement in The Histories of Herodotus where he makes a distinction between the ideal temperate climate of Greece as opposed to the overly cold climate of Scythia and the overly warm climate of Egypt. This was a common belief at the time and can also be found within the medical writings of Herodotus times including the On Airs Waters Places of the Hippocratic corpus. One can find a similar statement in Germania by Tacitus one of Montesquieus favorite authors.

Philip M. Parker in his book Physioeconomics endorses Montesquieus theory and argues that much of the economic variation between countries is explained by the physiological effect of different climates.

From a sociological perspective Louis Althusser in his analysis of Montesquieus revolution in method alluded to the seminal character of anthropologys inclusion of material factors such as climate in the explanation of social dynamics and political forms. Examples of certain climatic and geographical factors giving rise to increasingly complex social systems include those that were conducive to the rise of agriculture and the domestication of wild plants and animals.

A definitive edition of Montesquieus works is being published by the Société Montesquieu. It is planned to total 22 volumes of which half have appeared."
Étienne-Gabriel Morelly,"According to The Code of Nature ...where no property exists none of its pernicious consequences could exist.... As Morelly believed that almost all social and moral ills were a consequence of private property his proposed constitution eliminates most private property.

Because of this latter characteristic of his utopia Morelly is often seen as a significant forerunner of later socialist and communist thinkers. François-Noël Babeuf Charles Fourier Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Louis Blanc Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx all discussed Morellys ideas in their own writing.

Among the sacred and fundamental laws Morelly proposed was Nothing in society will belong to anyone either as a personal possession or as capital goods except the things for which the person has immediate use for either his needs his pleasures or his daily work. He was opposed to the possession of property beyond what an individual needed and especially to private property used to employ others.

How then would workers gain access to tools and equipment beyond personal possession if their job required it According to Morelly ...all these durable products will be gathered together in public stores in order to be distributed to all the citizens daily or at some other specified interval ...

He also proposed banning of trade between individuals In accordance with the sacred laws nothing will be sold or exchanged between citizens. Someone who needs for example greens vegetables or fruits will go to the public square which is where these items will have been brought by the man who cultivate them and take what he needs for one day only.

Morelly is often identified as an obscure tutor about whom almost nothing is known except that he lived in a small town in northwestern France Vitry-le-François."

He never did a Ph.D. Though less well known in the anglophone world due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world Europe and Latin America.

During his academic career he was primarily associated with the École des hautes études en sciences sociales in Paris.

At the beginning of the 20th century Morins family migrated from the Ottoman city of Salonica to Marseille and later to Paris where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish origin.

When the Germans invaded France in 1940 Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance. As a member of the French Resistance he adopted the pseudonym Morin which he continues to use. He joined the French Communist Party in 1941.

In 1945 Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in Landau where he served as a lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

In 1946 he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in LObservateur politique économique et littéraire. In the same year he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research .

Morin founded and directed the magazine Arguments . In 1959 his book Autocritique was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to and subsequent exit from the Communist Party focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.

In 1960 Morin travelled extensively in Latin America visiting Brazil Chile Bolivia Peru and Mexico. He returned to France where he published LEsprit du Temps a work on popular culture.

That same year French sociologist Georges Friedmann brought him and Roland Barthes together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that after several name changes became the Edgar Morin Centre of the EHESS Paris.

Also in 1960 Morin and Jean Rouch coauthored the film Chronique dun été an early example of cinéma vérité and direct cinema.

Beginning in 1965 Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in Plozévet.

In 1968 Morin replaced the incumbent professor of philosophy Henri Lefebvre at the University of Nanterre. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for Le Monde that tried to understand what he called The Student Commune. He followed the student revolt closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called The Revolution without a Face as well as coauthoring Mai 68 La brèche with Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lefort.

In 1969 Morin spent a year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla California. Jonas Salk invited him under the recommendation of Jacques Monod and John Hunt with the sole imposed condition of learning. It was there in this breeding ground for Nobel Prizes that he familiarized himself with systems theory. He read Henri Laborit James Watson Stéphane Lupasco Bronowski and was introduced to the thought of Gregory Bateson and the new problematic in ecology.

In 1983 he published De la nature de lURSS which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the perestroika of Mikhail Gorbachev.

In 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the International Ethical Scientific and Political Collegium. Also that year he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.

Following a meeting at a music festival in Fez Morocco in 2009 Morin became close with sociology professor Sabah Abouessalam. The couple married in 2012. He collaborated with her on the text Lhomme est faible devant la femme and in 2020 on Changeons de voie - Les leçons du coronavirus .

In addition to being the UNESCO Chair of Complex Thought Morin is known as a founder of transdisciplinarity and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities .

The University of Messina in Sicily Ricardo Palma University in Lima and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique the French National Research Center in Paris have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy. In addition the Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin a university based on his work was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French postmodern or poststructuralist movements instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucaults and Derridas. Morins work spans scholarly and popular literature and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including Sciences Humaines and a special issue of Le Monde.

Morin was elevated to the dignity of Knight Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour in the Honours List of Bastille Day 2021 by French President Macron."
Emmanuel Mounier,"Emmanuel Mounier was a French philosopher theologian teacher and essayist.

Mounier was the guiding spirit in the French personalist movement and founder and director of Esprit the magazine which was the organ of the movement. Mounier who was the child of peasants was a brilliant scholar at the Sorbonne. In 1929 when he was only twenty-four he came under the influence of the French writer Charles Péguy to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement. Mouniers personalism became a main influence of the non-conformists of the 1930s.

Peter Maurin used to say wherever he went There is a man in France called Emmanuel Mounier. He wrote a book called The Personalist Manifesto. You should read that book.

He taught at the Lycée du Parc at Lyon and at the Lycee Français Jean Monnet at Brussels.

Although Mounier was critical of the Moscow Trials of the 1930s he has been criticized by the historian Tony Judt among others for his failure to condemn the excesses of Stalinism in the postwar period.

In 1939 Mounier commented in a restrained manner on the newly elected Pope Pius XII remaining silent on the Italian invasion of Albania. Thus Mounier has contributed to the debate about Pope Pius XIIs controversial stance on the Holocaust."
Philippe Muray,"Philippe Muray March 2 2006 in Paris was a French essayist and novelist. None of his works have yet been translated into English. In 2010 the French actor Fabrice Luchini read some of Murays works at the Théâtre de lAtelier in Paris which contributed to a renewed discussion of his writings in the French press. Murays literary styles and the wealth of works he published make him one of the most important writers of the 20th and 21st century.

Very little is known about Murays personal life. His father was a writer and translator of English-language authors and his mother a devout reader. According to Muray himself his parents contributed significantly to his literary education and taste of literature. As soon as he could he started to study humanities in Paris.

During some months in 1983 he taught French literature at Stanford University in California. There he developed the concept of Lempire du bien and he collected materials to write his book Le XIXe siècle à travers les âges published in 1984. In that book he underlines the importance of occultism in the formation of socialism.

He also published a controversial essay about Céline in which he tried to explain the fierce antisemitism of the physician and critically acclaimed author of Journey to the End of the Night. Muray went on to argue that Célines antisemitism was partly a consequence of his hygienist beliefs as did the Nazis Céline believed that the Jews where both an obstacle to progress and a social illness.

Philippe Muray died on 2 March 2006 of lung cancer and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

An exceptional literary stylist and novelist Philippe Muray published many an article and essay in various French magazines such as LAtelier du roman criticizing what he saw as the absurdities and anomalies of the modern world. A philosopher and an artist he described the major upheavals that have led to the modern-day way of life trying to show how some aspects of modernity such as jihadists and neofascists wholly embraced the views of those they opposed.

A satirist he often wrote in a polemical tone and his perspective is sometimes classified as that of a cultural antimodernist or even reactionary though Muray did not qualify himself as such. He also wrote various works of fiction mostly under pseudonyms of which most are not yet known. Some of his best-known works Postérité Rubenss Glory On ferme Square Wheels Spiritual Exorcisims Lempire du bien Dear Jihadi Minimum Respect and Festivus Festivus have yet to be published in English.

Murays writing style is often detailed insistent and comical. A productive intellectual who described himself as a student of Louis Ferdinand Céline Balzac Bloy Bernanos and Péguy he coined numerous neologisms mostly pejorative such as Mutin de Panurge Artistocrate and Rebellocrate . The last is in some way akin to the concept of recuperation. Notably he referred tongue in cheek to the new form of Homo Sapiens devoted to pleasure and personal fulfillment as Homo Festivus.

Thought first and foremost a novelist whose intent was to describe the mores of his day and their consequences Muray was also an intellectual interested in major political and cultural changes. In his non-fiction work The 21st Century throughout the Ages Muray went on to explain how the gradual fall of the Church in Europe after the French Revolution gave rise in its place to a wave of occultism protosocialist and parapsychology ideologies. These ideologies are for Muray the root and stem of the major political movements that flourished in the 20th century and still dominate modern-day life i.e. feminism marxisim fascism environmentalism etc. For Muray intellectuals such as Auguste Comte Jules Michelet Victor Hugo Allan Kardec Freud Helena Blavatsky Emile Zola Lenin Adolf Hitler Foucault and far-right thinkers such as Edouard Drumont were all proponents of some kind of occultism that manifested itself through different brands of socialist beliefs . Muray went on to comment that the movement inspired French thinkers to hope for a regeneration of the human being in a form adapted to life in a Utopian society. This New Man stripped of his primordial defects it was hoped would be able to put the theories of socialists such as Karl Marx and Benito Mussolini into practice.

In 2002 Daniel Lindenberg included Muray in his list of new reactionaries along with Michel Houellebecq Maurice Dantec Alain Badiou Alain Finkielkraut and others. It has been demonstrated by Muray that Daniel Lindenberg had not read his works

Muray was criticised by the American historian Eugen Weber in his book France Fin de Siècle. While agreeing with the insight that there was a significant nexus between occultism and socialism in 19th-century France his overall assessment was that it was a wordy pretentious excruciatingly bad book to turn to Auguste Viattes Sources occultes de Romantisme."
Muretus,"Muretus is the Latinized name of Marc Antoine Muret a French humanist who was among the revivers of a Ciceronian Latin style and is among the usual candidates for the best Latin prose stylist of the Renaissance.

He was born at Muret near Limoges. At the age of eighteen he attracted the notice of the elder Scaliger and was invited to lecture in the archiepiscopal college at Auch. He afterwards taught Latin at Villeneuve and then at the College of Guienne Bordeaux where his Latin tragedy Julius Caesar was presented. Some time before 1552 he delivered a course of lectures in the college of Cardinal Lemoine at Paris which drew a large audience King Henry II and his queen being among his hearers. In Paris he formed part of the larger circle of humanists and poets that included Jean Dorat and Pierre Ronsard. He wrote almost exclusively in Latin epigrams odes satires and letters which were widely circulated before they were printed. His orations remained models for students through the eighteenth century.

His success made him many enemies and he was thrown into prison on a charge of homosexuality but released by the intervention of powerful friends. The same accusation was brought against him at Toulouse and he only saved his life by timely flight. The records of the town show that he was burned in effigy as a Huguenot and as sodomite .

After a wandering and insecure life of some years in Italy he received and accepted the invitation of the Cardinal Ippolito II dEste to settle in Rome in 1559. In 1561 Muretus revisited France as a member of the cardinals suite at the conference between Roman Catholics and Protestants held at Poissy.

He returned to Rome in 1563. His lectures gained him a European reputation and in 1578 he received a tempting offer from the king of Poland to become teacher of jurisprudence in his new college at Kraków. Muretus however who about 1576 had taken holy orders was induced by the liberality of Gregory XIII to remain in Rome where he died.

Muretus edited a number of classical authors with learned and scholarly notes. His other works include Juvenilia et poemata varia orationes and epistolae."
Jean-Luc Nancy,"Jean-Luc Nancy was a French philosopher. Nancys first book published in 1973 was Le titre de la lettre a reading of the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan written in collaboration with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. Nancy is the author of works on many thinkers including La remarque spéculative in 1973 on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Le Discours de la syncope and LImpératif catégorique on Immanuel Kant Ego sum on René Descartes and Le Partage des voix on Martin Heidegger. 

In addition to Le titre de la lettre Nancy collaborated with Lacoue-Labarthe on several other books and articles. Nancy is credited with helping to reopen the question of the ground of community and politics with his 1985 work La communauté désoeuvrée following Blanchots The Unavowable Community and Agamben responded to both with The Coming Community . One of the very few monographs that Jacques Derrida ever wrote on a contemporary philosopher is On Touching Jean-Luc Nancy.

Jean-Luc Nancy graduated in philosophy in 1962 from the University of Paris. He taught for a short while in Colmar before becoming an assistant at the Strasbourg Institut de Philosophie in 1968. In 1973 he received his doctorate with a dissertation on Kant under the supervision of Paul Ricœur. Nancy was then promoted to Maître de conférences at the Université des Sciences Humaines de Strasbourg. In the 1970s and 1980s Nancy was a guest professor at universities all over the world from the University of California to the Freie Universität in Berlin. He has been invited as a cultural delegate of the French Ministry of External Affairs to speak in Eastern Europe Britain and the United States. In 1987 Nancy became a Docteur dÉtat at the Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail for a thesis on freedom in Heidegger under the supervision of Gérard Granel. The jury was composed of Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Derrida. It was published as Lexpérience de la liberté .

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Nancy suffered serious medical problems. He underwent a heart transplant and his recovery was made more difficult by a long-term cancer diagnosis. He stopped teaching and participating in almost all of the committees with which he was engaged but continued to write. Many of his best known texts were published during this time. An account of his experience Lintrus was published in 2000. Nancy was a professor at the University of Strasbourg.

Filmmaker Claire Denis has made at least two movies inspired by Jean-Luc Nancy and his works. Many other artists have worked with Nancy as well such as Simon Hantaï Soun-gui Kim and Phillip Warnell. Nancy has written about the filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami and featured prominently in the film The Ister.

In 1980 Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe organized a conference at Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle on Derrida and politics entitled Les Fins de lhomme . The conference solidified Derridas place at the forefront of contemporary philosophy and was a place to begin an in-depth conversation between philosophy and contemporary politics. Further to their desire to rethink the political Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe set up in the same year the Centre de Recherches Philosophiques sur la Politique . The Centre was dedicated to pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions and supported such speakers as Claude Lefort and Jean-François Lyotard. By 1984 however Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe were dissatisfied with the direction work at the centre was taking and it was closed down.

During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers together and separately. Some of these texts appear in Les Fins de lhomme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida colloque de Cerisy 23 juillet-2 août 1980 Rejouer le politique La retrait du politique and Le mythe nazi . Many of these texts are gathered in translation in Retreating the Political .

Nancys first book on the question of community La Communauté désœuvrée is perhaps his best-known work. This text is an introduction to some of the main philosophical themes Nancy continued to work with. Nancy traces the influence of the notion of community to concepts of experience discourse and the individual and argues that it has dominated modern thought. Discarding popular notions Nancy redefines community asking what can it be if it is reduced neither to a collection of separate individuals nor to a hypostasized communal substance e.g. fascism. He writes that our attempt to design society according to pre-planned definitions frequently leads to social violence and political terror posing the social and political question of how to proceed with the development of society with this knowledge in mind. La Communauté désœuvrée means that community is not the result of a production be it social economic or even political production; it is not une œuvre a work of art .

Nancys dissertation for his Doctorat dÉtat looked at the works of Kant Schelling Sartre and Heidegger and concentrated on their treatment of the topic of freedom. It was published in 1988 as LExpérience de la Liberté . Since then Nancy has continued to concentrate on developing a reorientation of Heideggers work. Nancy treats freedom as a property of the individual or collectivity and looks for a non-subjective freedom which would attempt to think the existential or finite origin for every freedom. Nancy argues that it is necessary to think freedom in its finite being because to think of it as the property of an infinite subject is to make any finite being a limit of freedom. The existence of the other is the necessary condition of freedom rather than its limitation.

Nancy addresses the world in its contemporary global configuration in other writings on freedom justice and sovereignty. In his 1993 book Le sens du monde he asks what we mean by saying that we live in one world and how our sense of the world is changed by saying that it is situated within the world rather than above or apart from it. To Nancy the world or existence is our ontological responsibility which precedes political judicial and moral responsibility. He describes our being in the world as an exposure to a naked existence without the possibility of support by a fundamental metaphysical order or cause. Contemporary existence no longer has recourse to a divine framework as was the case in feudal society where the meaning and course of life was predetermined. The contingency of our naked existence as an ontological question is the main challenge of our existence in contemporary global society.

All of these themes relating to world are taken up again by Nancy in his 2002 book La création du monde ou la mondialisation where he makes the distinction between globalization as a deterministic process and mondialisation as an open-ended world-forming process. Here he connects his critique with Marxs critique of political economy which saw free labour as what produces the world. Nancy argues that an authentic dwelling in the world must be concerned with the creation of meaning and not final purposes closed essences and exclusive worldviews. The present system of expanding cities and nodes in the planetary techno-scientific network leads to the loss of world because the world is treated as an object even though the self-deconstruction of ontotheology increasingly made it the subject of its own creation.

In his book Être singulier pluriel Nancy tackles the question of how we can speak of a plurality of a we without making the we a singular identity. The premise of the title essay in this book is that there is no being without being-with that I does not come before we and that there is no existence without co-existence. In an extension from his thoughts on freedom community and the sense of the world he imagines the being-with as a mutual exposure to one another that preserves the freedom of the I and thus a community that is not subject to an exterior or pre-existent definition.

The five essays that follow the title piece continue to develop Nancys philosophy through discussions of sovereignty war and technology ecotechnics identity the Gulf War and Sarajevo. Nancys central concern in these essays remains the being-with which he uses to discuss issues of psychoanalysis politics and multiculturalism looking at notions of self and other in current contexts.

Nancy has also written for art catalogues and international art journals especially on contemporary art. He also writes poetry and for the theatre and has earned respect as an influential philosopher of art and culture. In his book Les Muses published in 1994 he begins with an analysis of Hegels thesis on the death of art. Among the essays in The Muses is a piece on Caravaggio originally a lecture given at the Louvre. In this essay Nancy looks for a different conception of painting where painting is not a representation of the empirical world but a presentation of the world of sense or of existence. Nancy has published books on film and music as well as texts on the problem of representation on the statute of literature on image and violence and on the work of On Kawara Charles Baudelaire and Friedrich Hölderlin.

Nancys text Lintrus formed the basis for French director Claire Deniss film of the same name.

He has written extensively on film including The Evidence of Film a short work on Abbas Kiarostami.

Nancy appears in the film The Ister based on Martin Heideggers 1942 lectures on Friedrich Hölderlins poem Der Ister . The film focuses on the relation of politics technology and myth.

Nancy has developed three films in conjunction with artist-filmmaker Phillip Warnell. He appears in their 2009 film Outlandish Strange Foreign Bodies which also features a text he wrote specifically for the project Étranges Corps Étrangers. Nancy contributed a poem Oh The Animals of Language to Warnells 2014 feature-length film Ming of Harlem Twenty One Storeys in the Air. Warnell and Nancy worked on a new text-film collaboration which was completed in 2017 The Flying Proletarian."
Gabriel Naudé,"Gabriel Naudé was a French librarian and scholar. He was a prolific writer who produced works on many subjects including politics religion history and the supernatural. An influential work on library science was the 1627 book Advice on Establishing a Library. Naudé was later able to put into practice all the ideas he put forth in Advice when he was given the opportunity to build and maintain the Bibliothèque Mazarine the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin.

Naudé is a precursor of Pierre Bayle and Fontenelle.

Naudé was born in Paris in early 1600 to a family of modest means. His father was a lowly official and his mother was a young illiterate woman. He was described by his teachers as tenacious and passionate about his education. Naudé entered college at a young age where he studied philosophy and grammar. Later he studied medicine at Paris and Padua and became physician to Louis XIII.

At the age of twenty Naudé published his first book Le Marfore ou Discours Contre les Lisbelles. The work would bring him to the attention of Henri de Mesme président à mortier of the Paris Parlement. Mesme offered Naudé the job of librarian to his personal collection. Mesmes had a large library for the period and it was open to scholars who had the appropriate references. Naudés service in Mesmes library would give him experience which he would use later to write the book Advice on Establishing a Library. Naudé wrote Advice for Mesme as a guide for building and maintaining his library. In 1629 he became librarian to Cardinal Guidi di Bagno at Rome and on Bagnis death in 1641 librarian to Cardinal Francesco Barberini.

At the desire of Cardinal Richelieu he began a controversy with the Benedictines denying Jean Gersons authorship of De Imitatione Christi. Richelieu intended to make Naudé his librarian and on his death Naudé accepted a similar offer from Cardinal Mazarin. For the next ten years he devoted himself to bringing together from all parts of Europe the assemblage of books known as the Bibliothèque Mazarine. Mazarin had brought with him to Paris a collection numbering over 5000 volumes. Like Naudé he believed in an open library to be used by the public for the public good. In 1642 he purchased a building to house his library and he instructed Naudé to build up the finest collection possible.

The fastest way was to absorb entire libraries into the collection advice that Naudé included in his book. Naudé plundered second hand book sellers and Mazarin instructed his ambassadors government officials and generals to collect books for him. Naudé was able to travel Europe and during one trip that lasted several months he collected over 14000 volumes. By 1648 the library had built up to an estimated at 40000 volumes. It was open on a regular basis and had built up a sizable number of regular patrons and several staff members to keep it functioning properly. It became the first in France to be open for all without references.

Mazarins library was sold by the parlement of Paris during the troubles of the Fronde and Queen Christina invited Naudé to Stockholm. He was not happy in Sweden and on Mazarins appeal that he should re-form his scattered library Naudé returned at once. But his health was broken and he died on the journey in Abbeville on 10 July 1653.

The friend of Gui Patin of Pierre Gassendi and all the liberal thinkers of his time Naudé was no mere bookworm; his books show traces of the critical spirit which made him a worthy colleague of the humorists and scholars who prepared the way for the better known writers of the siècle de Louis XIV.

Naudé in his career as a librarian opposed censorship and encouraged library owners to allow others to use their books a practice he considered a great honor for the owner an honor equal to that of having the opportunity to build a fine library. Naudé found it favorable to collect original format of books and to keep the volumes collected intact. He was a true believer of considering the needs of those that would access them and felt strong consideration to be sought from the experts in each particular field. He was adamant about collecting in all languages about all religions subject matters and literature.

During his career in librarianship Naudé helped instruct collectors and libraries in the selection and acquisition of their titles and how to create catalogs for their libraries. He was a major proponent of scouring secondhand bookshops and print shops for valuable and hard to find literary works. When Naudé has been in town the booksellers shops seem devastated as by a whirlwind. Having bought up in every last one of them all the books whether in manuscript or in print dealing in any language whatever with any subject or division of learning no matter what he has left the stores stripped and bare.

Naudé also had interesting ideas on the locale where a library should be located. While centrally located within the community it serves a library should be at some distance from the noisiest streets. It should if possible be situated between some spacious court and a pleasant garden from which it may enjoy good light a wide and agreeable prospect and pure air unpolluted by marshes sinks or dunghills; the whole arrangement so well planned and ordered that it is compelled to share nothing unpleasant or obviously inconvenient.

Probably the most famous library that Naudé helped shape and in which he served as librarian was the Bibliothéque Mazarine in Paris the library of Cardinal Jules Mazarin. Naudé spent ten years of his life improving and shaping the Bibliothéque. It became the first public library in France because of Naudés insistence and was open to the public as early as 1644.

Naudé is the subject of Peter Briscoes novel The Best Read Man in France.

Including works edited by him a list of ninety-two pieces is given in the Naudaeana. The principal ones are

A Bibliotheca Pontificia was completed and seen into print by Louis Jacob.

Advice written as a set of instructions for a private collector was based on Naudés own experience and research. In the introduction of his book Naudé wrote that he is not an expert in the field of librarianship but he presented what he believed to be the most important ideas. He based some of the opinions in Advice on his own experience in Mesmes library and wrote out for Mesme the accepted practices and principles of librarians of the time. Chapters covered topics such as number of books selecting the books procuring the books etc.

Naudés first chapter poses the question Why establish a library He answers the question with a simple message; there is no greater honor than building a great library and sharing it with the public. Naudé believes libraries should model themselves after the best libraries of the world. The first task is to create a plan. Before a person can erect a library he must educate himself on the subject of collecting and organizing books. A person must also seek the guidance of those who have already built their own libraries or are in the process. He suggests studying and copying the catalogues of other libraries.

Naudé devotes an entire chapter to book selection remarked upon throughout. The first authors who need to be purchased are those considered experts in their respective fields. No matter whether they are ancient or modern works if a book is held in high regard by practitioners of a particular field then it should be present in any collection. In addition any well known interpretations or commentaries that exist are a necessity. Naudé suggested purchasing books in the original languages because meaning can often be lost in translation. He is strongly against censorship of any kind. Naudé believes that every book has a reader regardless of the subject; and that information should be free and available. Readers could always find use of a book even if it is to refute the ideas presented on its pages. Certain books are popular at times but later forgotten; he argued that it would be beneficial to a library if there were multiple copies of these books to accommodate the popular tastes of the times.

In his chapter on book acquisition Naudé gave tips. The easiest way is to purchase another library in its entirety. Naudé went on to praise second-hand book sellers who often provided good books at cheap prices. Naudé himself browsed book-binding and printing shops for used paper and had once discovered a rare manuscript that a book binder was using as scrap paper.

Naudé included a chapter in Advice for arranging the books. In discussing arrangement he quoted Cicero It is order that gives light to memory. He gave instructions that he considered logical. His subject headings included theology philosophy jurisprudence medicine history mathematics and humanities. Naudé would add other subject heading in later years but these categories best represented the known body of knowledge in the world. Each section should be divided into subheadings and begin with the principal authors followed by the commentaries."
André Neher,"André Neher was a French Jewish scholar and philosopher.

Neher was born in Obernai Bas-Rhin. He was a student at the Collège Freppel in Obernai then at the Lycée Fustel de Coulange in Strasbourg. He became professor at the Collège Erckmann-Chatrian in Phalsbourg then at the Lycée Kléber in Strasbourg. During World War II he lived in Brive-la-Gaillarde where he was a member of Rabbi David Feuerwerkers community. After the War he became a professor at the University of Strasbourg in 1948. In 1974 at age 60 Neher moved with his wife Renée Neher-Bernheim to Jerusalem Israel.

His masterpiece is The Exile of the Word about the biblical silence and Gods silence after the Shoah and the great world tragedies. Neher thinks that through the Bibles silence one can discover divine revelation; through the silence human freedom is possible. He draws on the image of a suspension bridge to describe human ontological insecurity and pain caused by this freedom which is characterized by a radical factor of uncertainty. For this reason it is necessary to concentrate our attention not on the ideas of redemption or salvation but on being here in our life.

Jean Nicod,"Jean George Pierre Nicod was a French philosopher and logician best known for his work on propositional logic and induction.

Nicods main contribution to formal logic was to show that classical propositional calculus could be axiomatized with only one axiom - which is now known as Nicods axiom - and one rule of inference both formulated using the Sheffer stroke as only connective. In inductive logic and confirmation theory he famously proposed Nicods criterion according to which a conditional hypothesis is confirmed by all and only its positive instances. This principle plays a central role in the derivation of Carl Hempels raven paradox.

The Institut Jean Nicod a branch of the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique -- is research laboratory at the interface between cognitive science and the social sciences was named in honour of Nicods memory. Jean Nicods name is also commemorated by the prestigious Jean Nicod Lectures which are delivered annually in Paris by a leading philosopher of mind or philosophically oriented cognitive scientist. The lecturer is awarded the Jean Nicod Prize by the CNRS which sponsors the lectures to develop the field of cognitive science in France."

Ruwen Ogien,"Ruwen Ogien was a contemporary French philosopher. He was a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. He focused on moral philosophy and the philosophy of social science. He was the brother of Albert Ogien a sociologist.

Ogien was educated in Brussels Tel Aviv University of Cambridge Paris Columbia University and Montreal.

Trained in social anthropology he wrote extensively on poverty and immigration. His thesis in philosophy under the direction of Jacques Bouveresse was published under the title The Weakness of the Will. His last areas of research are moral philosophy and the philosophy of social sciences. He was also interested in the philosophy of action the notion of practical reason as well as practical irrationality. His other work was focused on the question of emotions including hatred and shame.

He was working to develop an ethical theory he called minimal ethics. This is an ethical anti-paternalistic theory which would give reason to minimize the areas of intervention of what he calls following John Stuart Mill the moral police. Minimal ethics arose initially in the form of three principles

Subsequently Ogien tried to reduce it to one Do not harm others nothing more following this reasoning

Finally what Ogien called minimal ethics is an ethic that excludes moral duties to oneself and positive paternalistic duties towards others. It tends to be reduced to one principle of not harming others. In accordance with this general conception of ethics it supports the freedom to do what one wants from his own life as long as we do not harm others which implies that the decriminalization of drug use all forms of sexual relations between consenting adults and active assistance to die for those who make the request. A special issue of the Journal of Theology and Philosophy was devoted to minimal ethics.

Ogien tried to relate ethics with similarly minimal work on the moral development of children and the variability of moral systems in a book published in September 2011 The influence of the smell of croissants on human kindness and other matters of experimental moral philosophy."
Michel Onfray,"Michel Onfray is a French writer and philosopher. Having a hedonistic epicurean and atheist world view he is a highly prolific author on philosophy having written over 100 books. His philosophy is mainly influenced by such thinkers as Nietzsche Epicurus the Cynic and Cyrenaic schools as well as French materialism.

He has gained notoriety for writing such works as Traité dathéologie Physique de la métaphysique Politique du rebelle traité de résistance et dinsoumission Physiologie de Georges Palante portrait dun nietzchéen de gauche La puissance dexister and La sculpture de soi for which he won the annual Prix Médicis in 1993.

His positions give rise to several controversies. From the 2010s some observers noted a right-wing orientation of Michel Onfray who became appreciated by far-right circles notably with his sovereignist magazine Front populaire.

Born in Argentan to a family of Norman farmers Onfray was sent to a weekly Catholic boarding school from ages 10 to 14. This was a solution many parents in France adopted at the time when they lived far from the village school or had working hours that made it too hard or too expensive to transport their children to and from school daily. The young Onfray however did not appreciate his new environment which he describes as a place of suffering. Onfray went on to graduate with a teaching degree in philosophy. He taught this subject to senior students at a high school that concentrates on technical degrees in Caen between 1983 and 2002. At that time he and his supporters established the Université populaire de Caen proclaiming its foundation on a free-of-charge basis and on the manifesto written by Onfray in 2004 .

Onfray is an atheist and author of Traité dAthéologie which became the number one best-selling nonfiction book in France for months when it was published in the Spring of 2005 . This book repeated its popular French success in Italy where it was published in September 2005 and quickly soared to number one on Italys bestseller lists.

In the 2002 election Onfray endorsed the French Revolutionary Communist League and its candidate for the French presidency Olivier Besancenot. In 2007 he endorsed José Bové but eventually voted for Olivier Besancenot and conducted an interview with the future French president Nicolas Sarkozy who he declared for Philosophie Magazine was an ideological enemy.

His book Le crépuscule dune idole Laffabulation freudienne published in 2010 has been the subject of considerable controversy in France because of its criticism of Sigmund Freud. He recognizes Freud as a philosopher but he brings attention to the considerable cost of Freuds treatments and casts doubts on the effectiveness of his methods.

In 2015 he published Cosmos the first book of a trilogy. Onfray considers ironically that it constitutes his very first book.

Onfray writes that there is no philosophy without self-psychoanalysis. He describes himself as an atheist and considers theistic religion to be indefensible.

Onfray has published 9 books under a project of history of philosophy called Counter-history of Philosophy. In each of these books Onfray deals with a particular historical period in western philosophy. The series of books are composed by the titles I. Les Sagesses Antiques II. Le Christianisme hédoniste III. Les libertins baroques IV. Les Ultras des Lumières V. LEudémonisme social VI. Les Radicalités existentielles and VII. La construction du surhomme Jean-Marie Guyau Friedrich Nietzsche . VIII. Les Freudiens hérétiques . IX. Les Consciences réfractaires .

In an interview he establishes his view on the history of philosophy. For him

There is in fact a multitude of ways to practice philosophy but out of this multitude the dominant historiography picks one tradition among others and makes it the truth of philosophy that is to say the idealist spiritualist lineage compatible with the Judeo-Christian world view. From that point on anything that crosses this partial in both senses of the word view of things finds itself dismissed. This applies to nearly all non-Western philosophies Oriental wisdom in particular but also sensualist empirical materialist nominalist hedonistic currents and everything that can be put under the heading of anti-Platonic philosophy. Philosophy that comes down from the heavens is the kind that from Plato to Levinas by way of Kant and Christianity needs a world behind the scenes to understand explain and justify this world. The other line of force rises from the earth because it is satisfied with the given world which is already so much.

Onfrays works have explored the philosophical resonances and components of science painting gastronomy sex and sensuality bioethics wine and writing. His most ambitious project is his projected six-volume Counter-history of Philosophy of which three have been published.

In opposition to the ascetic ideal advocated by the dominant school of thought hedonism suggests identifying the highest good with your own pleasure and that of others; the one must never be indulged at the expense of sacrificing the other. Obtaining this balance my pleasure at the same time as the pleasure of others presumes that we approach the subject from different angles political ethical aesthetic erotic bioethical pedagogical historiographical....

His philosophy aims for micro-revolutions or revolutions of the individual and small groups of like-minded people who live by his hedonistic libertarian values.

In La puissance dexister Manifeste hédoniste Onfray claims that the political dimension of hedonism runs from Epicurus to John Stuart Mill through Jeremy Bentham and Claude Adrien Helvétius. What political hedonism aims for is to create the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers.

Blogger J. M. Cornwell praised Onfrays Atheist Manifesto The Case Against Christianity Judaism and Islam claiming it is a religious and historical time capsule containing what he sees as the true deceptions of theological philosophy.

Recently he has been involved in promoting the work of Jean Meslier an 18th-century French Catholic priest who was discovered upon his death to have written a book-length philosophical essay promoting atheism.

In the atheist manifesto Onfray has said that among the incalculable number of contradictions and improbabilities in the body of the text of the synoptic Gospels two claims are made crucifixion victims were not laid to rest in tombs and in any case Jews were not crucified in this period. Ancient Historian John Dickson of Macquarie University has said that Philo of Alexandria writing about the time of Jesus says that sometimes the Romans handed the bodies of crucifixion victims over to family members for proper burial. The Roman Jewish historian Flavius Josephus even remarks the Jews are so careful about funeral rites that even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset. Regarding the second claim Dickson calls this a clear historical blunder.

In his latest book Décadence he argued for Christ myth theory which is a hypotheses that Jesus was not a historical person. Onfray based this on the fact that other than in the New Testament Jesus is barely mentioned in accounts of the period.

Onfray was a high school philosophy teacher for two decades until he resigned in 2002 to establish a tuition-free Université populaire at Caen at which he and several colleagues teach philosophy and other subjects.

Several authors criticize Onfray for approximations and historical errors contained in several of his works. This is particularly the case of historians Guillaume Mazeau Élisabeth Roudinesco Jean-Marie Salamito with his essay Monsieur Onfray au pays des mythes or even Ian Birchall.

Asteroid 289992 Onfray discovered by astronomers at the Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2005 was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 16 March 2014 ."
Nicole Oresme,"Nicole Oresme also known as Nicolas Oresme Nicholas Oresme or Nicolas dOresme was a French philosopher of the later Middle Ages. He wrote influential works on economics mathematics physics astrology and astronomy philosophy and theology; was Bishop of Lisieux a translator a counselor of King Charles V of France and one of the most original thinkers of 14th-century Europe.

Nicole Oresme was born c. 13201325 in the village of Allemagnes in the vicinity of Caen Normandy in the diocese of Bayeux. Practically nothing is known concerning his family. The fact that Oresme attended the royally sponsored and subsidised College of Navarre an institution for students too poor to pay their expenses while studying at the University of Paris makes it probable that he came from a peasant family.

Oresme studied the arts in Paris together with Jean Buridan Albert of Saxony and perhaps Marsilius of Inghen and there received the Magister Artium. He was already a regent master in arts by 1342 during the crisis over William of Ockhams natural philosophy.

In 1348 he was a student of theology in Paris. In 1356 he received his doctorate and in the same year he became grand master of the College of Navarre. In 1364 he was appointed dean of the Cathedral of Rouen. Around 1369 he began a series of translations of Aristotelian works at the request of Charles V who granted him a pension in 1371 and with royal support was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1377. In 1382 he died in Lisieux.

In his Livre du ciel et du monde Oresme discussed a range of evidence for and against the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. From astronomical considerations he maintained that if the Earth were moving and not the celestial spheres all the movements that we see in the heavens that are computed by the astronomers would appear exactly the same as if the spheres were rotating around the Earth. He rejected the physical argument that if the Earth were moving the air would be left behind causing a great wind from east to west. In his view the Earth Water and Air would all share the same motion. As to the scriptural passage that speaks of the motion of the Sun he concludes that this passage conforms to the customary usage of popular speech and is not to be taken literally. He also noted that it would be more economical for the small Earth to rotate on its axis than the immense sphere of the stars. Nonetheless he concluded that none of these arguments were conclusive and everyone maintains and I think myself that the heavens do move and not the Earth.

In his mathematical work Oresme developed the notion of incommensurate fractions fractions that could not be expressed as powers of one another and made probabilistic statistical arguments as to their relative frequency. From this he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets. From this he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who thinking they know with punctual exactness the motions aspects conjunctions and oppositions rashly and erroneously about future events.

Oresmes critique of astrology in his Livre de divinacions treats it as having six parts. The first essentially astronomy the movements of heavenly bodies he considers good science but not precisely knowable.The second part deals with the influences of the heavenly bodies on earthly events at all scales. Oresme does not deny such influence but states in line with a commonly held opinion that it could either be that arrangements of heavenly bodies signify events purely symbolically or that they actually cause such events deterministically. Mediaevalist Chauncey Wood remarks that this major elision makes it very difficult to determine who believed what about astrology.

The third part concerns predictiveness covering events at three different scales great events such as plagues famines floods and wars; weather winds and storms; and medicine with influences on the humours the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study and argues that the effect on the weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars since the zodiac was first described in ancient times.These first three parts are what Oresme considers the physical influences of the stars and planets on the earth and while he offers critiques of them he accepts that effects exist. The last three parts are what Oresme considers to concern fortune. They are interrogations meaning asking the stars when to do things such as business deals; elections meaning choosing the best time to do things such as getting married or fighting a war; and nativities meaning the natal astrology with birth charts that forms much of modern astrological practice. Oresme classifies interrogations and elections as totally false arts but his critique of nativities is more measured. He denies that any path is predetermined by the heavenly bodies because humans have free will but he accepts that the heavenly bodies can influence behaviour and habitual mood via the combination of humours in each person. Overall Oresmes skepticism is strongly shaped by his understanding of the scope of astrology. He accepts things a modern skeptic would reject and rejects some things such as the knowability of planetary movements and effects on weather that are accepted by modern science.

In discussing the propagation of light and sound Oresme adopted the common medieval doctrine of the multiplication of species as it had been developed by optical writers such as Alhacen Robert Grosseteste Roger Bacon John Pecham and Witelo. Oresme maintained that these species were immaterial but corporeal entities.

Oresmes most important contributions to mathematics are contained in Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality or accidental form such as heat he distinguished the intensio and the extensio . These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures approaching what we would now call rectangular coordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness whiteness and sweetness. Significantly for later developments Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed the longitudo represented the time and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.

He shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is then the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition the theorem of the latitudo uniformiter difformis became the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion; thus Oresme published what was taught over two centuries prior to Galileos making it famous. Diagrams of the velocity of an accelerating object against time in On the Latitude of Forms by Oresme have been cited to credit Oresme with the discovery of proto bar charts.

In De configurationibus Oresme introduces the concept of curvature as a measure of departure from straightness for circles he has the curvature as being inversely proportional to radius and attempts to extend this to other curves as a continuously varying magnitude.

Significantly Oresme developed the first proof of the divergence of the harmonic series. His proof requiring less advanced mathematics than current standard tests for divergence begins by noting that for any n that is a power of 2 there are n2 1 terms in the series between 1 and 1n. Each of these terms is at least 1n and since there are n2 of them they sum to at least 12. For instance there is one term 12 then two terms 13 14 that together sum to at least 12 then four terms 15 16 17 18 that also sum to at least 12 and so on. Thus the series must be greater than the series 11212 12... which does not have a finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent. This argument shows that the sum of the first n terms grows at least as fast as log2ndisplaystyle log _2n. 

Oresme was the first mathematician to prove this fact and it was not proven again until the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli.

He also worked on fractional powers and the notion of probability over infinite sequences ideas which would not be further developed for the next three and five centuries respectively.

Oresme like many of his contemporaries such as John Buridan and Albert of Saxony shaped and critiqued Aristotles and Averroess theories of motion to their own liking. Taking inspiration from the theories of forma fluens and fluxus formae Oresme would suggest his own descriptions for change and motion in his commentary of Physics. Forma fluens is described by William of Ockham as Every thing that is moved is moved by a mover and fluxus formae as Every motion is produced by a mover. Buridan and Albert of Saxony each subscribed to the classic interpretation of flux being an innate part of an object but Oresme differs from his contemporaries in this aspect. Oresme agrees with fluxus formae in that motion is attributed to an object but that an object is set into motion rather than given motion denying a distinction between a motionless object and an object in motion. To Oresme an object moves but it is not a moving object. Once an object begins movement through the three dimensions it has a new modus rei or way of being which should only be described through the perspective of the moving object rather than a distinct point. This line of thought coincides with Oresmes challenge to the structure of the universe. Oresmes description of motion was not popular although it was thorough. A Richard Brinkley is thought to be an inspiration for the modus-rei description but this is uncertain.

Oresme provided the first modern vernacular translations of Aristotles moral works that are still extant today. Between 1371 and 1377 he translated Aristotles Ethics Politics and Economics into Middle French. He also extensively commented on these texts thereby expressing some of his political views. Like his predecessors Albert the Great Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government. His criterium for good government is the common good. A king takes care of the common good whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty. Like Albert the Great Thomas Aquinas Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua whom he occasionally quotes Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive only the multitude of reasonable wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince changing the law and passing judgement. Oresme however categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good. Unlike earlier commentators however Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the kings will. It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity. Oresme favours moderate kingship thereby negating contemporary absolutist thought usually promoted by adherents of Roman law. Furthermore Oresme doesnt comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred as promoted by Évrart de Trémaugon in his Songe du vergier or Jean Golein in his Traité du sacre. Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt tyrannical and oligarchical he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.

It has traditionally been thought that Oresmes Aristotelian translations had a major influence on King Charles Vs politics Charles laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the kings council in the early 1370s. Oresme may have conveyed Marsilian and conciliarist thought to Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan.

With his Treatise on the origin nature law and alterations of money one of the earliest manuscripts devoted to an economic matter Oresme brings an interesting insight on the medieval conception of money. Oresmes viewpoints of theoretical architecture are outlined in Part 3 and 4 of his work from De moneta which he completed between 1356 and 1360. His belief is that humans have a natural right to own property; this property belongs to the individual and community. In Part 4 Oresme provides a solution to a political problem as to how a monarch can be held accountable to put the common good before any private affairs. Though the monarchy rightfully has claims on all money given an emergency Oresme states that any ruler that goes through this is a Tyrant dominating slaves. Oresme was one of the first medieval theorists that did not accept the right of the monarch to have claims on all money as well as his subjects right to own private property.

Oresme was known to be a well rounded psychologist. He practiced the technique of inner senses and studied the perception of the world. Oresme contributed to 19th and 20th century psychology in the fields of cognitive psychology perception psychology psychology of consciousness and psychophysics. Oresme discovered the psychology of unconscious and came up with the theory of unconscious conclusion of perception. He developed many ideas beyond quality quantity categories and terms which were labeled theory of cognition."
Marc-Alain Ouaknin,"Marc-Alain Ouaknin both a rabbi and a philosopher. He is the son of Rabbi Jacques Ouaknin and Eliane Erlich Ouaknin His father is the Grand Rabbi of the French cities of Reims Lille Metz and Marseille. Ouaknin dedicated his best-known work The Burnt Book to my father my master Grand Rabbi Jacques Ouaknin.

Ouaknin holds a doctorate in philosophy and is the Director of the Centre De Recherches Et Détudes Juives in Paris. He is also a professor of comparative literature at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. A major focus of his work since the 1980s has been to comment upon and extend the philosophy of Emmanuel Lévinas by comparing Levinass writings to other Jewish textsin particular to those of Hasidism and the Kabbalah. His work is in the continental philosophical tradition and emphasizes concepts current in French intellectual life. Unlike traditional rabbinic discourse Ouaknin regularly cites thinkers outside the Jewish tradition such as the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

Ouaknins books and articles have been translated into more than twenty languages. His best-known book in the English-speaking world is The Burnt Book ."
Georges Palante,"Georges Toussaint Léon Palante was a French philosopher and sociologist.

Palante advocated aristocratic individualist ideas similar to Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer. He was opposed to Émile Durkheims holism promoting methodological individualism instead.

Palante was born in Saint-Laurent-Blangy in the Pas-de-Calais on 20 November 1862. His father Emile Palante was an accountant from Liège. Palantes older brother Emile died when he was only five years old. He studied successively at the college of Arras where he excelled in Latin then at Lycée Louis-le-Grand where he earned his bachelors degree.

He obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Douai. In 1885 he began his career as professor of philosophy at Aurillac where he met his future wife Louise Genty whom he married three years later. The couple had a daughter named Germaine in 1890. Between 1886 and 1888 he studied in Châteauroux. In 1888 he received his agrégation in philosophy.

Palante separated from his first wife in 1890 and was appointed to teach at the Lycée de Saint-Brieuc Brittany then in the following years at Valenciennes La Rochelle and Niort. In 1893 he translated a work by Theobald Ziegler and began to publish articles. He returned in 1898 to the Lycée de Saint-Brieuc at which he worked for the remainder of his teaching career. Meanwhile he continued to work on his philosophical ideas publishing articles and essays in journals. Palante published collections of his articles in various books notably Combat pour lindividu in 1904 and La Sensibilité individualiste in 1909.

In 1907 Palante completed a draft doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne but it was never authorized. However he published the draft under the title Antinomies entre lindividu et la société in 1912 expanding it two years later under the title Pessimisme et individualisme .

In 1908 Palante stood in municipal elections as a socialist candidate but he was not elected. He took over from Jules de Gaultier at the philosophy journal Mercure de France holding the position for thirteen years. In 1916 he befriended the writer Louis Guilloux. During this period Palante lived a bohemian lifestyle drinking heavily and notoriously marking his students essays in a local brothel. He married his second wife Louise Pierre in 1923 and retired from teaching a year later. On 5 August 1925 Palante died from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head. The reasons for Palantes suicide are not certain but he is known to have been suffering from acromegaly a condition diagnosed when he was a student. A severe degenerative disease which had no cure at time it was making his life more and more painful.

A thoroughgoing Individualist he admired Friedrich Nietzsche and showed early interest in the work of Sigmund Freud. His thinking is also critical towards the mass herd instinct which he thought oppresses and prevents individuals from developing fully. However he did not oppose social networks and insisted that his philosophy did not seek to destroy society for the benefit of the individual but to help to build new networks of social interaction. In sociology he objected to the holistic model espoused by Émile Durkheim.

Initially close to socialist theories while critical of Marxist state socialism he increasingly rejected it as a political ideal although he did participate in 1908 municipal elections as a socialist candidate. He rejected the label anarchist but his ideas are nevertheless often regarded as a form of anarchism or at least as libertarianism. His ideas have some commonality with classical liberalism including his definition of the individual and his opposition to various barriers to trade. However he opposed it in so far as in his view individual being is not determined by rational choice since social determinism is constantly at work. In the economic field he also objected to capitalists seeking profits to the detriment of the poor and called for a politics of the belly.

Louis Guilloux wrote Souvenirs sur Georges Palante and took his inspiration from Palante to model his character Cripure in his novel Le Sang noir . He also puts Palantes ideas into the mouths of characters in other novels.

Palante is quoted in one of the footnotes to Albert Camus classic treatise The Rebel. Jean Grenier who was Camus philosophy teacher met Palante and devoted a full chapter to him in his book Les Grèves .

Michel Onfrays thesis and first published book Physiologie de Georges Palante contributed to the renewed interest in his work. The 2002 and 2005 reissues of the book were subtitled portrait dun nietzschéen de gauche ."
Brice Parain,"Brice Parain was a French philosopher and essayist.

He appeared as himself in Jean-Luc Godards 1962 film Vivre sa vie.

In Éric Rohmers film My Night at Mauds conversations about Pascals Wager are directly inspired by a similar debate between Parain and Dominique Dubarle in an episode of the television series En profil dans le texte called lEntretien sur Pascal in 1965 also produced by Rohmer."
Dominique Parodi,"Dominique Parodi was a French philosopher and educational administrator.

Dominique Parodi was born in Genoa. He was the son of Margarita and Dominique-Alexandre Parodi; his father was a poet and dramatist of Graeco-Italian background. A member of the group around Émile Durkheim he was a contributor to their journal LAnnée Sociologique. Between 1919 and 1934 he was General Inspector of Public Instruction. He succeeded Xavier Léon as editor of the Revue de métaphysique et de morale editing it from 1935 to 1955."
Blaise Pascal,"Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician physicist inventor philosopher writer and Catholic theologian. 

He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father a tax collector in Rouen. Pascals earliest mathematical work was on conic sections; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642 while still a teenager he started some pioneering work on calculating machines establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.

Like his contemporary Rene Descartes Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum in 1647.

In 1646 he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654 he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascals Wager known in the original as the Discourse on the Machine a fideistic probabilistic argument for Gods existence. In that year he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.

Throughout his life Pascal was in frail health especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.

Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand which is in Frances Auvergne region by the Massif Central. He lost his mother Antoinette Begon at the age of three. His father Étienne Pascal who also had an interest in science and mathematics was a local judge and member of the Noblesse de Robe. Pascal had two sisters the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.

In 1631 five years after the death of his wife Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. Étienne who never remarried decided that he alone would educate his children for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.

Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues thinking the 16-year-old Pascal produced as a means of proof a short treatise on what was called the Mystic Hexagram Essai pour les coniques and sent ithis first serious work of mathematicsto Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascals theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line .

Pascals work was so precocious that René Descartes was convinced that Pascals father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was indeed the product of the son and not the father Descartes dismissed it with a sniff I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients adding but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.

In France at that time offices and positions could beand werebought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65665 livres. The money was invested in a government bond which provided if not a lavish then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to and enjoy Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years War defaulted on the governments bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascals worth had dropped from nearly 66000 livres to less than 7300.

Like so many others Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a childrens play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the kings commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouena city whose tax records thanks to uprisings were in utter chaos.

In 1642 in an effort to ease his fathers endless exhausting calculations and recalculations of taxes owed and paid Pascal not yet 19 constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction called Pascals calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden Germany exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.

Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive the Pascaline became little more than a toy and a status symbol for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design. He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.

Pascals development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling today it is extremely important in economics especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty risk decision-making and an individuals and societys ability to influence the course of future events. However Pascal and Fermat though doing important early work in probability theory did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace.

In 1654 prompted by his friend the Chevalier de Méré he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and given the current circumstances of the game want to divide the stakes fairly based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later used a probabilistic argument Pascals wager to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz formulation of the calculus.

Pascals Traité du triangle arithmétique written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle but is now called Pascals triangle. The triangle can also be represented

He defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion Call the number in the th row and th column tmn. Then tmntm1ntmn1 for m012... and n012... The boundary conditions are tm10 t1n0 for m123... and n123... The generator t001. Pascal concluded with the proof

In the same treatise Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction. In 1654 he proved Pascals identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p 0 1 2 ... k.

That same year Pascal had a religious experience and mostly gave up work in mathematics.

In 1658 Pascal while suffering from a toothache began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and to publicize the results proposed a contest. 

Pascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity area and volume of the cycloid with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges and neither of the two submissions were judged to be adequate. While the contest was ongoing Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wrens proof in Walliss Tractus Duo giving Wren priority for the first published proof.

Pascal contributed to several fields in physics most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascals law . He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.

His work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak in what became known as Pascals barrel experiment.

By 1647 Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricellis experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space rather than a vacuum. Nature abhors a vacuum. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance moved by another substance. Furthermore light passed through the glass tube suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space.

Following more experimentation in this vein in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by Récit de la grande expérience de léquilibre des liqueurs published in 1648.

The Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight Earths atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de Dôme mountain 4790 feet tall but his health was poor so could not climb it. On 19 September 1648 after many months of Pascals friendly but insistent prodding Florin Périer husband of Pascals elder sister Gilberte was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascals theory. The account written by Périer reads

The weather was chancy last Saturday... around five oclock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...

Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines.

In a reply to the plenist Estienne Noel Pascal wrote echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability In order to show that a hypothesis is evident it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena that suffices to establish its falsity.

Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.

In the winter of 1646 Pascals 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the mans age and the state of medicine in the 17th century a broken hip could be a very serious condition perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice for the old man survived and was able to walk again... But treatment and rehabilitation took three months during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.

Both men were followers of Jean Guillebert proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently and after their successful treatment of his father borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period Pascal experienced a sort of first conversion and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.

Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his worldly period . His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad not because of her choice but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.

Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay but that didnt work either. At the heart of this was...Blaises fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal she would have to leave her inheritance behind... nothing would change her mind.

By the end of October in 1651 a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day according to Gilberte concerning her brother He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline who was waiting in the little parlor...In early June 1653 after what must have seemed like endless badgering from JacquelinePascal formally signed over the whole of his sisters inheritance to Port-Royal which to him had begun to smell like a cult. With two-thirds of his fathers estate now gone the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty. 

For a while Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654 he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.

On the 23 of November 1654 between 1030 and 1230 at night Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began Fire. God of Abraham God of Isaac God of Jacob not of the philosophers and the scholars... and concluded by quoting Psalm 11916 I will not forget thy word. Amen. He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.His belief and religious commitment revitalized Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion the Provincial Letters.

In literature Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists. 

Beginning in 165657 Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period . Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661 in the midsts of the formulary controversy the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal in 1657 had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander while publicly opposing them nonetheless was persuaded by Pascals arguments.

Aside from their religious influence the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascals use of humor mockery and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

It is in the Provincial Letters that Pascal made his oft-quoted apology for writing a long letter as he had not had time to write a shorter one.From Letter XVI as translated by Thomas MCrieReverend fathers my letters were not wont either to be so prolix or to follow so closely onone another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter isa very long one simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.

Charles Perrault wrote of the Letters Everything is therepurity of language nobility of thought solidity in reasoning finesse in raillery and throughout an agrément not to be found anywhere else.

Pascal is arguably best known as a philosopher considered by some the second greatest French mind behind René Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes. However he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology empiricism preferring fideism.

He cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are according to Wood born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness.

Pascals major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De lEsprit géométrique originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites écoles de Port-Royal . The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time however he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them upfirst principles therefore cannot be reached. Based on this Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.

Pascal also used De lEsprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.

In De lArt de persuader Pascal looked deeper into geometrys axiomatic method specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.

Man is only a reed the weakest in nature but he is a thinking reed.

Pascals most influential theological work referred to posthumously as the Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language.Will Durant hailed the Pensées as the most eloquent book in French prose.

The Pensées was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne . The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion et sur quelques autres sujets and soon thereafter became a classic. 

One of the Apologies main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism personalized by Montaigne on one hand and Epictetus on the other in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.

T. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as a man of the world among ascetics and an ascetic among men of the world. Pascals ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659 Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors saying Sickness is the natural state of Christians.

Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response Pascal wrote one of his final works Écrit sur la signature du formulaire exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year his sister Jacqueline died which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascals last major achievement returning to his mechanical genius was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line the carrosses à cinq sols moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation The carriages has a fixed route fixed price and left even if there were no passengers. It is widely considered that the idea of public transportation was well ahead of time. The lines were not commercially successful and the last one closed by 1675.

In 1662 Pascals illness became more violent and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sisters death. Aware that his health was fading quickly he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662 Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning his last words being May God never abandon me and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.

An autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined though speculation focuses on tuberculosis stomach cancer or a combination of the two. The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.

One of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand France Université Blaise Pascal is named after him. Établissement scolaire français Blaise-Pascal in Lubumbashi Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after Pascal.

The 1969 Eric Rohmer film My Night at Mauds is based on the work of Pascal. Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic Blaise Pascal which originally aired on Italian television in 1971. Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary Sea of Faith presented by Don Cupitt. The chameleon in the film Tangled is named for Pascal.

A programming language is named for Pascal. In 2014 Nvidia announced its new Pascal microarchitecture which is named for Pascal. The first graphics cards featuring Pascal were released in 2016.

The 2017 game Nier Automata has multiple characters named after famous philosophers; one of these is a sentient pacifistic machine named Pascal who serves as a major supporting character. Pascal creates a village for machines to live peacefully with the androids theyre at war with and acts as a parental figure for other machines trying to adapt to their newly-found individuality.

The otter in the Animal Crossing series is named for Pascal."
Frédéric Paulhan,"Frédéric Paulhan was a French philosopher. He came from a family of merchants of Huguenot ancestry and was a brilliant student at school in Nîmes. He left without graduating and spent a few years without a recognised profession studying and writing and developing an interest in philosophy and Republican political movements. In 1877 Paulhan contributed to the Revue Philosophique of Théodule Ribot. Paulhan became liable for military service when his assigned number was drawn in a lottery but he was released from serving because of his stutter which also made it difficult for him to teach.

After a political upset in the Nîmes city administration which favoured Republicans Paulhan was appointed librarian in 1881. During the years he held this post Paulhan applied positivist methods to the institution modernising it. He married Jeanne Thérond in 1884 and that same year their son was born the future writer and editor Jean Paulhan. Frédéric Paulhan resigned his post in December 1896 affected by political instability in the municipality and he moved to Paris. Here he continued to write and he also built up an art collection of etchings drawings pastels along with a few paintings purchased at auction. This collection was sold in 1934.

Paulhan entered the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1902 sponsored by Ribot. He was awarded the Prix Jean-Reynaud in 1928. Paulhan was a freethinker a Dreyfusard and possibly a Freemason; his work has importance in the current of French psychology. Among his books are Les caractères Les mensonges du caractère Le mensonge dans lart and Le mensonge du monde .

Frédéric Paulhan died on 14 March 1931. He is buried in the cemetery at Bagneux under a headstone carved with Masonic symbols."

Yvonne Picard,"Yvonne Picard was a French philosopher and a member of the French Resistance during the Second World War. She and her brother the historian Gilbert Charles-Picard were the children of the archaeologist Charles Picard.

Yvonne Picard was born in Athens Greece her father being head of the French School at Athens at the time. She obtained a degree in Philosophy and became an adherent of Marxism. She began teaching at the École normale supérieure at Sèvres.

In 1941 she joined the Socialisme et Liberté group founded by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and also joined the Resistance. She soon left Sartres group believing it amateurish instead joining the Communist Youth. The police traced her through her connection with a member of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans and obtained her address from her unsuspecting parents. Her Paris associates included Raoul Lévy and Bianca Lamblin. Along with her fiancé Gaston Étiévent she was arrested in May 1942. Étiévent was shot without trial in August 1942 and Yvonne Picard was imprisoned at Fort de Romainville; she was later deported to Auschwitz concentration camp leaving Compiègne by a transport of 24 January 1943.

Raymond Polin,"Raymond Polin was a French philosopher.

He was the president of the University of Paris from 1976 to 1981."
Georges Politzer,"Georges Politzer was a French philosopher and Marxist theoretician of Hungarian Jewish origin affectionately referred to by some as the red-headed philosopher . He was a native of Oradea a city in present-day Romania .

Politzer was already a militant by the time of his involvement in the Hungarian insurrection of 1919 at age seventeen during the Hungarian Soviet Republic led by Béla Kun. He went into exile during the White Terror that preceded the establishment of a right-wing government under the regency of Admiral Miklós Horthy.

After meeting Freud and Sándor Ferenczi in Vienna he settled in Paris in 1921. He joined the French Communist Party between 1929 and 1931.

At the beginning of the 1930s the Communist Party founded the Workers University of Paris which lasted until dissolution by German occupation in 1939. During his tenure at the university Politzer was entrusted with and given charge of a course on dialectical materialism.

In this same period he occupied the post of professor of philosophy at Lycée Marcelin Berthelot in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés.

Mobilized to Paris in 1940 he remained on the side of the French Communist Party secret command. Demobilized in July 1940 he oversaw the edition of a clandestine bulletin. After his comrade and friend Paul Langevin a physicist of world renown was arrested in October 1940 Politzer published the first edition of The Free University which told of the imprisonment of scholars and denounced the extortions committed by invading fascists during World War II. He worked with other writers like Jacques Decour Jacques Solomon or Valentin Feldman. All were executed by the nazis in 1942.

In February 1942 Politzers operations were stopped; he was arrested along with his wife Mai for violating the law banning the Communist Party. He underwent torture being turned over to the Nazis on 20 March 1942 and undergoing execution by firing squad at their hands on 23 May of that year just after having secretly published a French academic journal. His wife was transported to Auschwitz where she died in March 1943.

A disciple of Marx and Lenin Politzer was very interested in psychology preaching the concrete aspects of this field in relation to which he qualified traditional psychology as abstract. He also took a lively interest in nascent Freudian theory and its uses before eventually distancing himself from it.His posthumous work Elementary Principles of Philosophy based on notes taken by his followers was the first work banned by the fascist military regime established in Turkey in 1980.

Supporters posit that all that was new upsetting the house of Politzer has been repudiated ridiculed; and all of that was not upsetting to the official dominant philosophy has been favored."
Jean-Bertrand Pontalis,"Jean-Bertrand Pontalis was a French philosopher writer editor and psychoanalyst.

A student of Jean-Paul Sartre Pontalis became a professor of philosophy in the forties before undergoing an analysis with his associate Jacques Lacan the following decade. He was however one of the minority group of disciplesanalysands who did not follow Lacan into the École Freudienne de Paris but rather stayed within the legitimist sphere as founding members of the Association Psychanalytique de France of which he later became president.

Together with Jean Laplanche he wrote the influential work The Language of Psychoanalysis in 1967; while among his later more literary writings were Windows and Crossing the Shadows.

His 1993 autobiography Love of Beginnings was deliberately ahistorical emphasising what he called holes in discourse where the process of slipping through or evading set formats and ways of thinking opened up new beginnings When words fail it is because without realising it one is about to touch a different earth."
Gilbert de la Porrée,"Gilbert de la Porrée also known as Gilbert of Poitiers Gilbertus Porretanus or Pictaviensis was a scholastic logician and theologian.

He was born in Poitiers and completed his first studies there. He was then educated at Chartres under Bernard of Chartres where he learned the differences between Aristotle and Plato and later at Laon under Anselm of Laon and Ralph of Laon where he studied biblical scriptures. After his education he returned to Poitiers where its believed he taught. He then returned to Chartres to teach logic and theology and took over Chancellor after Bernard from 11261140. It is in Paris where we also know he gave lectures. From a passage from the text Dialogue with Ratius and Everard by the Cistercian Everardus we learn that Gilbert was more popular in Paris than in Chartres. Everardus writes that he was fourth to attend Gilberts lectures in Chartres and three hundredth to attend in Paris. In Paris John of Salisbury attended Gilberts lectures in 1141 and was greatly influenced by them. John of Salisbury would later become chancellor of Chartres and also wrote over Gilbert saying He taught grammar and theology would whip a student who made a grammatical error if he believed a student was wasting time in class he would suggest they take up bread making and last when he lectured he used philosophers orators and as well as poets to help interpret.

Sometime in the 1140s Gilbert published his Commentary on Boethiuss Opuscula Sacra. Although intended as an explanation of what Boethius meant it interpreted the Holy Trinity in such a way that it went against the teachings of the church. In 1142 Gilbert became Bishop of Poitiers and within the same year two archdeacons Arnaud and Calon denounced Gilbert for his ideas on the Trinity. It was also in 1142 when Gilberts teaching position was taken over in Chartres. By 1147 in Paris Peter Lombard attacked Gilbert for his trinitarian beliefs. In 1148 Saint Bernard of Clairvaux known as the great detector of heresies brought Gilbert to trial. Saint Bernard had previous reasons to believe Gilbert was a heretic because when Abelard was tried and condemned the school of Chartreswhere Gilbert was chancellor at that momentbacked Abelard. Pope Eugene III presided over the trial. During the trial Gilbert and Bernard were asked to recite and speak of specific biblical scriptures. Bernard being nowhere near as well versed as Gilbert was not able to condemn him. It was decided however that in order to make the church happy Gilbert had to change parts of his book that were not in accordance with the official position on faith. Gilbert died in 1154.

Gilbert is almost the only logician of the 12th century who is quoted by the greater scholastics of the succeeding age. The Liber sex principiorum attributed to him but of an anonymous author was regarded with a reverence almost equal to that paid to Aristotle and furnished matter for numerous commentators amongst them Albertus Magnus. Owing to the fame of this work he is mentioned by Dante as the Magister sex principiorum. The treatise itself is a discussion of the Aristotelian categories specially of the six subordinate modes.The author distinguishes in the ten categories two classes one essential the other derivative. Essential or inhering in the objects themselves are only substance quantity quality and relation in the stricter sense of that term. The remaining six when where action passion position and habit are relative and subordinate . This suggestion has some interest but is of no great value either in logic or in the theory of knowledge. More important in the history of scholasticism are the theological consequences to which Gilberts realism led him.

In the commentary on the treatise De Trinitate of Boethius he proceeds from the metaphysical notion that pure or abstract being is prior in nature to that which is. This pure being is God and must be distinguished from the triune God as known to us. God is incomprehensible and the categories cannot be applied to determine his existence. In God there is no distinction or difference whereas in all substances or things there is duality arising from the element of matter. Between pure being and substances stand the ideas or forms which subsist though they are not substances. These forms when materialized are called formae substantiales or formae nativae; they are the essences of things and in themselves have no relation to the accidents of things. Things are temporal the ideas perpetual God eternal. The pure form of existence that by which God is God must be distinguished from the three persons who are God by participation in this form. The form or essence is one the persons or substances three. This distinction clearly goes against the churchs tenet of divine simplicity. It was this distinction between Deitas or Divinitas and Deus that led to the condemnation of Gilberts doctrine."
Nicos Poulantzas,"Nicos Poulantzas was a Greek-French Marxist political sociologist and philosopher. In the 1970s Poulantzas was known along with Louis Althusser as a leading Structural Marxist and while at first a Leninist he eventually became a proponent of democratic socialism. He is best known for his theoretical work on the state but he also offered Marxist contributions to the analysis of fascism social class in the contemporary world and the collapse of dictatorships in Southern Europe in the 1970s .

Poulantzas studied law in Greece and moved to France in 1961; there he completed a doctorate in the philosophy of law under the title The rebirth of natural Law in Germany in 1964. He taught sociology at the University of Paris VIII from 1968 until his death. He was married to the French novelist Annie Leclerc and had one daughter. He committed suicide in 1979 by jumping from the window of a friends flat in Paris.

Poulantzass theory of the state reacted to what he saw as simplistic understandings within Marxism. Instrumentalist Marxist accounts held that the state was simply an instrument in the hands of a particular class. Poulantzas disagreed with this because he saw the capitalist class as too focused on its individual short-term profit rather than on maintaining the classs power as a whole to simply exercise the whole of state power in its own interest. Poulantzas argued that the state though relatively autonomous from the capitalist class nonetheless functions to ensure the smooth operation of capitalist society and therefore benefits the capitalist class. In particular he focused on how an inherently divisive system such as capitalism could coexist with the social stability necessary for it to reproduce itselflooking in particular to nationalism as a means to overcome the class divisions within capitalism. Poulantzas has been particularly influential over the Marxist state theorist Bob Jessop.

Borrowing from Antonio Gramscis notion of cultural hegemony Poulantzas argued that repressing movements of the oppressed is not the sole function of the state. Rather state power must also obtain the consent of the oppressed. It does this through class alliances where the dominant group makes an alliance with subordinate groups as a means to obtain the consent of the subordinate group. In his later works Poulantzas analysed the role of what he termed the new petty bourgeoisie in both consolidating the ruling classes hegemony and undermining the proletariats ability to organise itself. By occupying a contradictory class positionthat is to say by identifying with its de facto oppressorthis fraction of the working class throws its lot in with the bourgeois whose fate it believes it shares. The fragmentation of the class system is for Poulantzas a defining characteristic of late capitalism and any politically useful analysis must tackle this new constellation of interests and power. A highly abbreviated example of this can be seen in a Poulantzas-influenced analysis of the New Deal in the United States the American ruling class by acceding to some of the demands of labour helped cement an alliance between labour and a particular fraction of capital and the state . This was necessary for the continued existence of capitalism for if the ruling class had simply repressed the movements and avoided making any concessions it could have led to a socialist revolution.

Poulantzas provides a nuanced analysis of class structure in an era when the internationalisation of production systems was shifting power from labour to capitalist classes. In many areas he foresaw the current debate on the critical Marxian language of class bourgeoisie and hegemony finds little echo in contemporary political science where its positivism requires researchers to focus on putative measurable and objective entities. However by placing class analysis at the center of political analysis Poulantzas reminds us that theorists are political agents themselves and that accounts of the political world are suffused with the ambient ideology that they suppose themselves to bracket.

The official think-tank of SYRIZA a left-wing Greek political party is called Nicos Poulantzas Institute."
François Poullain de la Barre,"François Poullain de la Barre was an author Catholic priest and a Cartesian philosopher.

François Poullain de la Barre was born on July 1647 in Paris France to a family with judicial nobility. He added de la Barre to his name later in life. After graduating in 1663 with a master of arts he spent three years at the College of Sorbonne where he studied theology. In 1679 he became an ordained Catholic priest. From 1679 to 1688 he led two modest parishes Versigny and La Flamengrie in Picardy in northern France.

In 1688 Poullaine de la Barre left Picardy and the priesthood to return to Paris. At the time the Catholic Church was critical of Cartesianism. By 1689 he moved to Geneva where he converted to Calvinism a branch of Protestantism. The following year he married Marie Ravier. After a year as a tutor he got a position teaching at a local Genevan university. After the Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes he was exiled in the Republic of Geneva where he obtained the citizenship in 1716. He spent the remainder of his life in Geneva where he died on May 4 1723.

During a physiology conference in 1667 a friend of Poullain de la Barre introduced him to Cartesianism a philosophy created by philosopher René Descartes. Poullain de la Barre later adopted the philosophy and applied Cartesian principles to feminist thought and wrote many texts of social philosophy which denounced injustice against woman and by the inequality of the female condition. He opposed the discrimination women experienced and championed social equality between women and men.

Six years after his introduction to Cartesianism Poullain de la Barre published a three part series on the female condition. In 1673 he published On the Equality of the Two Sexes A Physical and Moral Discourse Which Shows That it is Important to Rid Oneself of Prejudice which argued that the difference between men and women goes beyond the body but is in the constitution of the body. He rejected the idea that the minds of men and women differ historically proclaiming the mind has no sex. In claiming sexual difference lies in part through the constitution of the body Poullain de la Barre argued the unequal treatment that women experience in religious and educational instruction and the effects of the environment create a perceived apparent innate difference between the sexes. In his assessment this does not have a natural basis it is not essential nor is it innate but proceeds from cultural prejudice and can be understood as social constructionist. Poullain de la Barre advocated for female education emphasizing that women should receive a true and quality education. He also asserted that all careers including scientific ones should be open to them.

In 1674 he published On the Education of Ladies To Guide the Mind in Sciences and Morals continuing his reflection on the education of women but utilizing Socratic dialogue. He addresses the historical constrains of the time. In 1675 François Poullain de la Barre published the third in his series On the Excellence of Men Against the Equality of the Sexes. The title was sarcastic; the book was a rebuttal of those opposed to gender equality.

Opinions about Poullain de la Barres place in the history of feminism vary considerably but his theories have often been used by others such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.Pierre Bayle has advanced the theory that Poullain may have refuted his own thesis because he felt threatened but the arguments antifeminists advanced are doubtful of this refutation.

Simone de Beauvoir includes a quotation from Poullain de la Barre in an epigraph to The Second Sex in 1949 All that has been written about women by men should be suspect for the men are at once judge and party."
Maurice Pradines,"Maurice Pradines was a French philosopher. Although his thought was largely original Pradines may be categorized among the interwar period philosophers of the mind. Also a professor he developed a philosophy of knowledge in light of problems of sensation.

In the work of Pradines the problem of sensation is brought back to that of the union of soul and body. A number of classic authors considered their separation theoretically. Pradines posed the inverse thesis that of the immanence of the mind to the body. Any primary or developed psychic phenomenon above all belongs to a living being. How could it be then that the body could proceed from the mind Pradines endeavored to show that in order to explain this relationship it is necessary to constitute a history or a genesis of the life of the mind.

If the mind is something living then this question must be answered what is life Pradines distinguished two modalities of life needy life and defensive life. They are characterized by their respective movements

Initially the person with an egoistic tendency likes himself. But in order to perdure he must find means of preserving himself. Consequently he will have no other choice than to confront himself with the world. This contact with exteriority is capital it is what will make possible the distinction between soul and mind.

As a tendency first to preservation as a tension originating toward self and toward others as self life is love animation soul. The soul is the first degree of spiritualization of the living thing as a tendency towards something.

Here sensation intervenes as an urgent point in Pradinesian thought and is distinguished into two categories

According to Pradines philosophy never correctly wondered about the problem of sensation. He takes aim at the empirists as those who missed the essential they held sensation only as the starting point of knowledge. In reality philosophy almost always sticks to the causes and never to the function. Sensation in its function is precisely of primary importance since someone who provokes it in a living body does so only if the provocation interests the body and acquires a meaning for its life. Sensation is the psychic phenomenon by which life gives itself something to understand the reality with which it is confronted. Nevertheless if it proves to be paramount it is not the first criterion of the mind.

It is preceded by affectivity because it is necessary to perceive in order to sense. Here again Pradines distinguishes two occurrences

Sensoriality makes possible the meaning of the need and defense. But it is not more or less affective. Because the affectivity which is fuzzy and vague cannot be divided into degrees sensoriality is instead more or less representative.

If affectivity is not characterized by pleasure or pain it is between these two extremes that the sensoriality will be able to exert itself. At this point sensation becomes a perception or what one could call an insensitive sensation.

Space is what is constituted in sensoriality we always perceive that which is not us according to our adaptation to reality. This is the meaning of defense which we allow ourselves because if there is not escape there is through detachment foresight of the possible pain. These meanings are specific to space and thus to the mind because they do not blindly embrace reality but permit an intellectual knowledge through the depth that they establish in our relationships with objects. In being forced to differentiate space the living thing accedes to the world of the mind that is to say to intelligence and knowledge."
Quatremère de Quincy,"Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremère de Quincy was a French armchair archaeologist and architectural theorist a Freemason and an effective arts administrator and influential writer on art.

Born in Paris Quatremère de Quincy trained for the law then followed courses in art and history at the Collège Louis-le-Grand and apprenticed for a time in the atelier of Guillaume Coustou the Younger and Pierre Julien getting some practical experience in the art of sculpture. A trip to Naples in the company of Jacques-Louis David sparked his interest in Greek and Roman architecture.

He was involved in the troubles of the French Revolution. He was a royalist in the National Legislative Assembly of 17911792 and his politics were monarchist and Catholic. As a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Public Instruction his set of three Considerations on the arts of design in France was offered before the Assemblée Nationale at a time when the continuation of the former academies was under question; he offered a program for their reform. in part by opening up the Paris salons. In 17911792 he orchestrated the conversion of the Church of Ste-Geneviève in Paris into the Panthéon infilling the windows to give it the character of a mausoleum. In 1795 he was accused of taking part in the preparations for the royalist insurrection of 13 Vendémiaire and condemned to death but subsequently acquitted.

In July 1796 he wrote a pseudo-epistolary treatise against the French plans to seize works of art from Rome arguing that European powers should instead contribute a sum to the papacy for protecting art and knowledge. Shortly afterward he was behind a petition signed by forty-seven Parisian artists including Jacques-Louis David which questioned the benefits of displacing art from Rome; although prudently worded there was a vituperative official response.

In the same year he was elected to the Council of Five Hundred for the Seine department then went into hiding after taking part in a royalist coup. While in exile in Germany he read Immanuel Kant and Gotthold Lessing whose philosophy informed his own theories of aesthetics. In 1800 back in Paris he was appointed secretary general of the Seine council. From 1816 until 1839 he was perpetual secretary to the Académie des Beaux-Arts which gave him great influence upon official architecture and in 1818 he became a professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque Nationale. He briefly returned to politics in 1820. In 1826 he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

Quatremère de Quincy was the author of numerous articles and books. From 1788 to 1825 he wrote the three Architecture volumes of the Encyclopédie Méthodique. His Dictionnaire historique de lArchitecture was published in 18321833. He wrote biographies of several artists Antonio Canova Raphael and Michelangelo .

He transformed the simple metaphor of architecture as language into a framework for reconceptualizing the structure of architecture; modern writers describing vernacular architecture or the Baroque idiom or the vocabulary of Classicism owe a debt to Quatremère de Quincy.

His essay De lArchitecture Égyptienne written for a competition posed by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1785 and published in 1803 just as the Description de lEgypte was in preparation nevertheless was an important influence on the Egyptian Revival phase of Neoclassical architecture for its theoretical observations concerning the origins of architecture rather than for its historical naiveté. He was among the first to point out the use of polychromy in Greek sculpture and architecture. Though he insisted that landscape gardening could not be admitted among the fine arts he was a key figure in the establishment of the first landscaped cemeteries and his essay translated into English as The Nature the End and the Means of Imitation in the Fine Arts influenced J. C. Loudon."
Petrus Ramus,"Petrus Ramus was an influential French humanist logician and educational reformer. A Protestant convert he was one of the most prominent victims of the St. Bartholomews Day massacre.

He was born at the village of Cuts Picardy; his father was a farmer. He gained admission at age twelve to the Collège de Navarre working as a servant. A reaction against scholasticism was in full tide at a transitional time for Aristotelianism. On the occasion of receiving his M.A. degree in 1536 Ramus allegedly took as his thesis Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent commentitia esse which Walter J. Ong paraphrases as follows

All the things that Aristotle has said are inconsistent because they are poorly systematized and can be called to mind only by the use of arbitrary mnemonic devices.

According to Ong this kind of spectacular thesis was in fact routine at the time. Even so Ong raises questions as to whether Ramus actually ever delivered this thesis.

Ramus as graduate of the university started courses of lectures. At this period he was engaged in numerous separate controversies. One opponent in 1543 was the Benedictine Joachim Périon. He was accused by Jacques Charpentier professor of medicine of undermining the foundations of philosophy and religion. Arnaud dOssat a pupil and friend of Ramus defended him against Charpentier. Ramus was made to debate Goveanus over two days. The matter was brought before the parlement of Paris and finally before Francis I. By him it was referred to a commission of five who found Ramus guilty of having acted rashly arrogantly and impudently and interdicted his lectures .

He withdrew from Paris but soon afterwards returned the decree against him being canceled by Henry II who came to the throne in 1547 through the influence of Charles Cardinal of Lorraine. He obtained a position at the Collège de Navarre.

In 1551 Henry II appointed him a regius professor at the Collège de France but at his request he was given the unique and at the time controversial title of Professor of Philosophy and eloquence. For a considerable time he lectured before audiences numbering as many as 2000. Pierre Galland another professor there published Contra novam academiam Petri Rami oratio and called him a parricide for his attitude to Aristotle. The more serious charge was that he was a nouveau academicien in other words a sceptic. Audomarus Talaeus a close ally of Ramus had indeed published a work in 1548 derived from Ciceros description of Academic scepticism the school of Arcesilaus and Carneades.

In 1561 he faced significant enmity following his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from Paris; and though he found asylum in the palace of Fontainebleau his house was pillaged and his library burned in his absence. He resumed his chair after this for a time but he was summoned on 30 June 1568 before the Kings Attorney General to be heard with Simon Baudichon and other professors the position of affairs was again so threatening that he found it advisable to ask permission to travel.

He spent around two years in Germany and Switzerland. The La Rochelle Confession of Faith earned his disapproval in 1571 rupturing his relationship with Theodore Beza and leading Ramus to write angrily to Heinrich Bullinger.

Returning to France he fell a victim in the St. Bartholomews Day Massacre . Hiding for a while in a bookshop off the Rue St Jacques he returned to his lodgings on 26 August the third day of the violence. There he was stabbed while at prayer. Suspicions against Charpentier have been voiced ever since. His death was compared by one of his first biographers his friend and colleague Nicolas de Nancel to the murder of Cicero.

A central issue is that Ramuss anti-Aristotelianism arose out of a concern for pedagogy. Aristotelian philosophy in its Early Modern form as scholasticism showing its age was in a confused and disordered state. Ramus sought to infuse order and simplicity into philosophical and scholastic education by reinvigorating a sense of dialectic as the overriding logical and methodological basis for the various disciplines.

He published in 1543 the Aristotelicae Animadversiones and Dialecticae Partitiones the former a criticism on the old logic and the latter a new textbook of the science. What are substantially fresh editions of the Partitiones appeared in 1547 as Institutiones Dialecticae and in 1548 as Scholae Dialecticae; his Dialectique a French version of his system is the earliest work on the subject in the French language.

In the Dialecticae partitiones Ramus recommends the use of summaries headings citations and examples. Ong calls Ramuss use of outlines a reorganization of the whole of knowledge and indeed of the whole human lifeworld.

After studying Ramuss work Ong concluded that the results of his methodizing of the arts are the amateurish works of a desperate man who is not a thinker but merely an erudite pedagogue. On the other hand his work had an immediate impact on the issue of disciplinary boundaries where educators largely accepted his arguments by the end of the century.

The logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time and there existed a school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents in France Germany Switzerland and the Netherlands. It cannot be said however that Ramuss innovations mark any epoch in the history of logic and there is little ground for his claim to supersede Aristotle by an independent system of logic. The distinction between natural and artificial logic i.e. between the implicit logic of daily speech and the same logic made explicit in a system passed over into the logical handbooks.

He amends the syllogism. He admits only the first three figures as in the original Aristotelian scheme and in his later works he also attacks the validity of the third figure following in this the precedent of Laurentius Valla. Ramus also set the modern fashion of deducing the figures from the position of the middle term in the premises instead of basing them as Aristotle does upon the different relation of the middle to the major term and minor term.

As James Jasinski explains the range of rhetoric began to be narrowed during the 16th century thanks in part to the works of Peter Ramus. In using the word narrowed Jasinski is referring to Ramus argument for divorcing rhetoric from dialectic a move that had far reaching implications for rhetorical studies and for popular conceptions of public persuasion. Contemporary rhetoricians have tended to reject Ramuss view in favor of a more wide ranging understanding of the rhetorical arts as encompassing a range of ordinary language practices. Rhetoric traditionally had had five parts of which inventio was the first. Ramus insisted on rhetoric to be studied alongside dialectic through two main manuals invention and judgement under the dialectic manual and style and delivery in the rhetoric manual. Memory one of the five skills of traditional rhetoric was regarded by Ramus as being part of psychology as opposed to being part of rhetoric and thus dispensed from his idea of rhetoric and dialectic.Brian Vickers said that the Ramist influence here did add to rhetoric it concentrated more on the remaining aspect of elocutio or effective use of language and emphasised the role of vernacular European languages . Ramist reforms strengthened the rhetoricians tendency to focus on style. The effect was that rhetoric was applied in literature.

Invention involves fourteen topics including definition cause effect subject adjunct difference contrary comparison similarity and testimony. Style encompasses four tropes metaphor synecdoche metonymy and irony. It also includes rules for poetic meter and rhythmical prose figures corresponding to attitudes a speaker may take and of repetition. Delivery covers the use of voice and gestures.

His rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of logic as the ars disserendi; he maintains that the rules of logic may be better learned from observation of the way in which Cicero persuaded his hearers than from a study of Aristotles works on logic .

Logic falls according to Ramus into two parts invention and judgment . Here he was influenced by Rodolphus Agricola. This division gave rise to the jocular designation of judgment or mother-wit as the secunda Petri. But what Ramus does here in fact redefines rhetoric. There is a new configuration with logic and rhetoric each having two parts rhetoric was to cover elocutio and pronuntiatio. In general Ramism liked to deal with binary trees as method for organising knowledge.

He was also known as a mathematician a student of Johannes Sturm. It has been suggested that Sturm was an influence in another way by his lectures given in 1529 on Hermogenes of Tarsus the Ramist method of dichotomy is to be found in Hermogenes.

He had students of his own. He corresponded with John Dee on mathematics and at one point recommended to Elizabeth I that she appoint him to a university chair.

The views of Ramus on mathematics implied a limitation to the practical he considered Euclids theory on irrational numbers to be useless. The emphasis on technological applications and engineering mathematics was coupled to an appeal to nationalism .

The teachings of Ramus had a broadly based reception well into the seventeenth century. Later movements such as Baconianism pansophism and Cartesianism in different ways built on Ramism and took advantage of the space cleared by some of the simplifications it had effected. The longest-lasting strand of Ramism was in systematic Calvinist theology where textbook treatments with a Ramist framework were still used into the eighteenth century particularly in New England.

The first writings on Ramism after the death of Ramus included biographies and were by disciples of sorts Freigius Banosius Nancelius of whom only Nancelius was closely acquainted with the man. Followers of Ramus in different fields included Johannes Althusius Caspar Olevianus John Milton Johannes Piscator Rudolph Snellius and Hieronymus Treutler.

He published fifty works in his lifetime and nine appeared after his death. Ong undertook the complex bibliographical task of tracing his books through their editions."
Jacques Rancière,"Jacques Rancière is a French philosopher Professor of Philosophy at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII VincennesSaint-Denis. After co-authoring Reading Capital with the structuralist Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and others after witnessing the 1968 political uprisings his work turned against Althusserian Marxism and he later came to develop an original body of work focused on aesthetics.

Rancière contributed to the influential volume Reading Capital before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 student uprising in Paris; Rancière felt Althussers theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.

Since then Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up our understanding of political discourse such as ideology and proletariat. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with knowledge particularly the limits of philosophers knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancières book entitled Le philosophe et ses pauvres a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

From 1975 to 1981 Rancière was a figurehead for the Journal Les Révoltes Logiques. Forming partly out of a philosophy seminar on Workers history that Rancière gave at Vincennes it drew together philosophers and historians for a radical political intervention into French thought after the May 1968 uprisings. Its title acting as both a reference to Arthur Rimbauds poem Democratie and the Maoist Cultural Revolutionary slogan adopted by the Gauche Prolétarienne group of which some of Les Rèvoltes Logiques members were active within On a raison de se revolter It is right to revolt. the Journal attempted to interrogate and contest the historiographic and political norms around the representation of workers and social history. Writing along with figures like feminist historian Genevieve Fraisse Rancière and others attempted to reveal the complexity contradictions and diversity of thought and history from below. In its fifteen ordinary issues the collective wished to overcome the historiographic norms in which the working class were given historical treatment but rendered voiceless homogeneous and pre-theoretical; instead they allowed workers to speak for themselves and interrogated their words seriously.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people again the problem of masses justify human rights interventions and even war.

Rancières book The Ignorant Schoolmaster Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation was written for educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination. In doing so he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything . Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach themselves whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore anyone can lead and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the equality of intelligence and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in The Ignorant Schoolmaster saying that there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies.

Rancières philosophy is radically anti-elitist and aggressively anti-authoritarian his mature philosophy primarily distinguished by his proposal to obliterate the distinction between aesthetics and politics.Gabriel Rockhill published an English glossary of Rancières technical terms in 2004 as Appendix I to the English translation of Rancières The Politics of Aesthetics with cross references to their explication in Rancières major works. This glossary includes key terms in Rancières philosophy that either he invented or uses in a radically different manner than their common usages elsewhere such as aesthetic regime aesthetic unconscious archi-politics Community of Equals demos dissensus distribution of the sensible emancipation the ethical regime of images literarity meta-politics ochlos para-politics partition of the sensible police order the poetics of knowledge post-democracy regimes of art silent speech and le tort.

Rancières political philosophy is characterized by a number of key concepts politics disagreement police equality post-democracy

Politics an activity the subject of which is equality.

Disagreement an insurmountable conflict between people which is inherent in human nature and manifests itself in a speech situation when one of the interlocutors understands and does not understand the other at the same time.

Police a symbolic ordering of the social aimed at determining the share of participation or lack of participation in each part. The concept goes back to the work of Michel Foucault in the 1970s.

Equality a set of practices aimed at certifying the equality of anyone with anyone.

Post-democracy consensus system of modernity based on the identity of society and the individual and the consideration of society as the sum of its parts.

In 2006 it was reported that Rancières aesthetic theory had become a point of reference in the visual arts and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair. Former French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal described Rancière as her favourite philosopher. Among those intellectuals influenced by his work Gabriel Rockhill the editor and translator into English of Rancières The Politics of Aesthetics has developed a new paradigm for thinking about the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancières writings.

The literary critic Rita Felski has named Rancière as an important precursor to the project of postcritique within literary studies."
Gérard Raulet,"Gérard Raulet is a French philosopher Germanist and translator specializing primarily in the thought of Herbert Marcuse and Ernst Bloch. He is a professor emeritus of German History and Thought at the Paris-Sorbonne University.

Raulet was born 9 August 1949 in Sceaux Hauts-de-Seine. Raulet studied at Saint-Cloud École Normale Superieure graduating in 1969. Raulet then qualified as a German instructor in 1973 earned his PhD in 1981 and doctorat dÉtat in 1985.

A prolific author Raulet has devoted several works to German philosophers such as Walter Benjamin Max Scheler Karl Marx. He is also the author of publications on the culture of Weimar and German political philosophy. He is the translator of the article by Jürgen Habermas called The Enlightenment an unfinished project in response to the postmodernist criticism on which Raulet himself worked.

Between 1975 and 1987 Raulet was first an instructor and then assistant professor at the Paris-Sorbonne University before joining the university of University of Rennes 2 as a professor in 1987. He then taught at the university of Paris-XII before joining the École normale supérieure de Lyon in 1997. Raulet taught at the École normale supérieure de Lyon until 2003 after which he rejoined the Paris-Sorbonne University where is currently a professor emeritus. From 1981 to 1999 he also oversaw the Weimar Cultural Study Group at the Maison des Sciences de lHomme in Paris.

Raulet has written extensively on the subject of the Frankfurt School with specific attention to Herbert Marcuse the subject of his Herbert Marcuse Philosophie de lemancipation published in 1992. Raulet argues that the notion of emancipation is central to Marcuses philosophy as Marcuse sought to develop a third position between conceptions of utopian emancipation in Soviet Marxism and those of human nature latent in American capitalism. Philosopher Joseph Bien regarded the text as one of the most important works on Marcuse published in the late twentieth century and Raulet as one of Frances more important younger social philosophers."
Félix Ravaisson-Mollien,"Jean-Gaspard-Félix Laché Ravaisson-Mollien was a French philosopher perhaps Frances most influential philosopher in the second half of the nineteenth century. He was originally and remains more commonly known as Félix Ravaisson. His seminal key work was De lhabitude translated in English as Of Habit. Ravaissons philosophy is in the tradition of French Spiritualism which was initiated by Pierre Maine de Biran with the essay The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking . However Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called spiritualist realism and spiritualist positivism and - according to Ravaisson scholar Mark Sinclair - can be thought of as founding the school of contingency. His most well known and influential successor was Henri Bergson with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s; although the lineage of this philosophy of life can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with Gilles Deleuze. Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes. In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the Louvre. Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France a position of considerable influence. Ravaisson was not only a philosopher classicist archivist and educational administrator but also a painter exhibiting under the name Laché.

Ravaisson was born at Namur. After a successful course of study at the Collège Rollin he went to Munich in autumn 1839 where he attended the lectures of Schelling and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work Essai sur la métaphysique dAristote to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of Aristotle and the Peripatetics but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.

In 1838 he received his doctorate his thesis entitled De lhabitude which was to become a classic text and became professor of philosophy at Rennes. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre . He died in Paris.

In philosophy he was one of the school of Victor Cousin with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness according to him is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.

Ravaissons complete three major philosophical works are Essai sur la métaphysique dAristote ; De lhabitude ; and Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme siècle . Ravaisson also produced a number of other noteworthy essays such as La Philosophie contemporaine ; La Philosophie de Pascale and Métaphysique et Morale . Upon his death he also left unfinished fragments of a major work which were published posthumously first as Testament philosophique in Revue de métaphysique et de morale then later in extended form as Testament philosophique ."
Robert Redeker,"Robert Redeker is a French writer and philosophy teacher. He was teaching at the Pierre-Paul-Riquet high school in Saint-Orens-de-Gameville and at the École Nationale de lAviation Civile. He is currently in hiding under police protection.

On 19 September 2006 a few days before the Islamic month of Ramadan he wrote an opinion piece for Le Figaro a French secular and conservative newspaper which quickly removed the article from its public database. In it he attacked Islam and Muhammad writing Pitiless war leader pillager butcher of Jews and polygamous this is how Mohammed is revealed by the Koran. He called the Quran a book of incredible violence adding Jesus is a master of love Muhammad a master of hate. That days issue of Le Figaro was banned in Egypt and Tunisia. Afterwards Redeker received various death threats originating from one Islamist website . He requested and was given police protection. A man has been arrested because of a hate mail he sent to Redeker.

On 3 October 2006 a group of renowned French intellectuals published appel en faveur de Robert Redeker in Le Monde among them Elisabeth Badinter Alain Finkielkraut André Glucksmann Claude Lanzmann and Bernard-Henri Lévy. They see their most fundamental liberties endangered by a handful of fanatics under the pretense of religious laws and decry the tendency in Europe to avoid provocations in order to not anger supposed foreign sensitivities. The vast majority of the official responses was however hostile to the ex-philosophy teacher - including Frances Le Monde who characterized Redekers piece as excessive misleading and insulting."
Charles de Rémusat,"Charles François Marie Comte de Rémusat was a French politician and writer.

He was born in Paris. His father Auguste Laurent Comte de Rémusat whose family came from Toulouse was chamberlain to Napoleon Bonaparte but acquiesced in the restoration and became prefect first of Haute Garonne and then of Nord. Charles mother was Claire Élisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes Madame de Rémusat.

He developed political views more liberal than those of his parents and having been brought up for a career in law he published in 1820 a pamphlet on trial by jury. He was an active journalist showing in philosophy and literature the influence of Victor Cousin and is said to have furnished to no small extent the original of Honoré de Balzacs character Henri de Marsay. He signed the journalists protest against the Ordinances of July 1830 and in the following October was elected deputy for Haute Garonne.

Becoming a Doctrinaire he supported most of those measures of restriction on popular liberty which made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals. In 1836 he became for a short time undersecretary of state for the interior. He then became an ally of Adolphe Thiers and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a brief period. In the same year he became an Academician. For the rest of Louis Philippes reign he was in opposition until he joined Thiers in his attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848. During this time Rémusat constantly spoke in the chair here but was still more active in literature especially on philosophical subjects the most remarkable of his works being his book on Pierre Abélard . He had to leave France after the coup détat; nor did he re-enter political life during the Second Empire until 1869 when he founded a moderate opposition journal at Toulouse. Neither the Revolution of 1848 nor the Second Empire was tohis taste. Eventually he gave up hope for the restoration of constitutional monarchy in France and he declared himself in favor of the Third French Republic I have never desired anything else than the peaceful triumph of the great principles of the French Revolution. I hoped that the monarchy would bring it forth; today I put my hopes in the Republic firmly maintained and wisely organized.

In 1871 he refused the Vienna embassy offered him by Thiers but in August he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in succession to Jules Favre. Although minister he was not a deputy and on standing for Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by Désiré Barodet. A month later he was elected for Haute Garonne by a great majority. He died in Paris.

During his abstention from politics Rémusat continued to write on philosophical history especially English. Saint Anselme de Cantorbéry appeared in 1854; LAngleterre au ... son temps etc. in 1858; John Wesley in 1870; Lord Herbert de Cherbury in 1874; Histoire de la philosophie en Angleterre depuis Bacon jusquà Locke in 1875; besides other and minor works. He wrote well was a forcible speaker and an acute critic; but his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Victor Cousin in philosophy and of the somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in politics probably limited his powers though both no doubt accorded with his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1873."
Ernest Renan,"Joseph Ernest Renan was a French Orientalist and Semitic scholar expert of Semitic languages and civilizations historian of religion philologist philosopher biblical scholar and critic. He wrote influential and pioneering historical works on the origins of early Christianity and espoused popular political theories especially concerning nationalism and national identity. Renan is credited as being among the first scholars to advance the now-discreditedKhazar theory which held that Ashkenazi Jews were descendants of the Khazars Turkic peoples who had adopted Jewish religion and migrated to Western Europe following the collapse of their khanate.

He was born at Tréguier in Brittany to a family of fishermen. His grandfather having made a small fortune with his fishing smack bought a house at Tréguier and settled there and his father captain of a small cutter and an ardent republican married the daughter of a Royalist tradesman from the neighbouring town of Lannion. All his life Renan was aware of the conflict between his fathers and his mothers political beliefs. He was five years old when his father died and his sister Henriette twelve years his senior became the moral head of the household. Having in vain attempted to keep a school for girls at Tréguier she departed and went to Paris as a teacher in a young ladies boarding-school.

Ernest meanwhile was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of his native town. His school reports describe him as docile patient diligent painstaking thorough. While the priests taught him mathematics and Latin his mother completed his education. Renans mother was half Breton. Her paternal ancestors came from Bordeaux and Renan used to say that in his own nature the Gascon and the Breton were constantly at odds.

During the summer of 1838 Renan won all the prizes at the college of Tréguier. His sister told the doctor of the school in Paris where she taught about her brother and he informed F. A. P. Dupanloup who was involved in organizing the ecclesiastical college of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet a school in which the young Catholic nobility and the most talented pupils of the Catholic seminaries were to be educated together with the idea of creating friendships between the aristocracy and the priesthood. Dupanloup sent for Renan who was then fifteen years old and had never been outside Brittany. I learned with stupor that knowledge was not a privilege of the Church ... I awoke to the meaning of the words talent fame celebrity. Religion seemed to him wholly different in Tréguier and in Paris. He came to view Abbé Dupanloup as a father figure.

In 1840 Renan left St Nicholas to study philosophy at the seminary of Issy-les-Moulineaux. He entered with a passion for Catholic scholasticism. Among the philosophers Thomas Reid and Nicolas Malebranche first attracted him and then he turned to G. W. F. Hegel Immanuel Kant and J. G. Herder. Renan began to see a contradiction between the metaphysics which he studied and the faith he professed but an appetite for verifiable truths restrained his scepticism. Philosophy excites and only half satisfies the appetite for truth; I am eager for mathematics he wrote to Henriette. Henriette had accepted in the family of Count Zamoyski an engagement more lucrative than her former job. She exercised the strongest influence over her brother.

It was not mathematics but philology which was to settle Renans gathering doubts. His course completed at Issy in 1844 he entered the college of St Sulpice in order to take his degree in philology prior to entering the church and here he began the study of Hebrew. He realized that the second part of the Book of Isaiah differs from the first not only in style but in date that the grammar and the history of the Pentateuch are later than the time of Moses and that the Book of Daniel is clearly written centuries after the time in which it is set. At night he read the new novels of Victor Hugo; by day he studied Hebrew and Syriac under Arthur-Marie Le Hir. In October 1845 Renan left St Sulpice for Stanislas a lay college of the Oratorians. Still feeling too much under the domination of the church he reluctantly ended the last of his associations with religious life and entered M. Crouzets school for boys as a teacher.

Renan educated by priests was to accept the scientific ideal with an extraordinary expansion of all his faculties. He became ravished by the splendor of the cosmos. At the end of his life he wrote of Amiel The man who has time to keep a private diary has never understood the immensity of the universe. The certitudes of physical and natural science were revealed to Renan in 1846 by the chemist Marcellin Berthelot then a boy of eighteen his pupil at M. Crouzets school. To the day of Renans death their friendship continued. Renan was occupied as usher only during evenings. During the daytime he continued his researches in Semitic philology. In 1847 he obtained the Volney prize one of the principal distinctions awarded by the Academy of Inscriptions for the manuscript of his General History of Semitic Languages. In 1847 he took his degree as Agrégé de Philosophie that is to say fellow of the university and was offered a job as master in the lycée Vendôme.

In 1856 Renan married in Paris Cornélie Scheffer daughter of Hendrik Scheffer and niece of Ary Scheffer both French painters of Dutch descent. They had two children Ary Renan born in 1858 who became a painter and Noémi born in 1862 who eventually married philologist Yannis Psycharis. In 1863 the American Philosophical Society elected him an international Member.

Within his lifetime Renan was best known as the author of the enormously popular Life of Jesus . Renan attributed the idea of the book to his sister Henriette with whom he was traveling in Ottoman Syria and Palestine when struck with a fever she died suddenly. With only a New Testament and copy of Josephus as references he began writing. The book was first translated into English in the year of its publication by Charles E. Wilbour and has remained in print for the past 145 years. Renans Life of Jesus was lavished with ironic praise and criticism by Albert Schweitzer in his book The Quest of the Historical Jesus.

Renan argued Jesus was able to purify himself of Jewish traits and that he became an Aryan. His Life of Jesus promoted racial ideas and infused race into theology and the person of Jesus; he depicted Jesus as a Galilean who was transformed from a Jew into a Christian and that Christianity emerged purified of any Jewish influences. The book was based largely on the Gospel of John and was a scholarly work. It depicted Jesus as a man but not God and rejected the miracles of the Gospel. Renan believed by humanizing Jesus he was restoring to him a greater dignity. The books controversial assertions that the life of Jesus should be written like the life of any historic person and that the Bible could and should be subject to the same critical scrutiny as other historical documents caused controversy and enraged many Christians and Jews were enraged because of its depiction of Judaism as foolish and absurdly illogical and for its insistence that Jesus and Christianity were superior.

Renan was not only a scholar. In his book on St. Paul as in the Apostles he shows his concern with the larger social life his sense of fraternity and a revival of the democratic sentiment which had inspired LAvenir de la Science. In 1869 he presented himself as the candidate of the liberal opposition at the parliamentary election for Meaux. While his temper had become less aristocratic his liberalism had grown more tolerant. On the eve of its dissolution Renan was half prepared to accept the Empire and had he been elected to the Chamber of Deputies he would have joined the group of lEmpire liberal but he was not elected. A year later war was declared with Germany; the Empire was abolished and Napoleon III became an exile. The Franco-Prussian War was a turning-point in Renans history. Germany had always been to him the asylum of thought and disinterested science. Now he saw the land of his ideal destroy and ruin the land of his birth; he beheld the German no longer as a priest but as an invader.

In La Réforme Intellectuelle et Morale Renan tried to safeguard Frances future. Yet he was still influenced by Germany. The ideal and the discipline which he proposed to his defeated country were those of her conquerora feudal society a monarchical government an elite which the rest of the nation exists merely to support and nourish; an ideal of honor and duty imposed by a chosen few on the recalcitrant and subject multitude. The errors attributed to the Commune confirmed Renan in this reaction. At the same time the irony always perceptible in his work grows more bitter. His Dialogues Philosophiques written in 1871 his Ecclesiastes and his Antichrist are incomparable in their literary genius but they are examples of a disenchanted and sceptical temper. He had vainly tried to make his country obey his precepts. The progress of events showed him on the contrary a France which every day left a little stronger and he roused himself from his disbelieving disillusioned mood and observed with interest the struggle for justice and liberty of a democratic society. The fifth and sixth volumes of the Origins of Christianity show him reconciled with democracy confident in the gradual ascent of man aware that the greatest catastrophes do not really interrupt the sure if imperceptible progress of the world and reconciled also if not with the truths at least with the moral beauties of Catholicism and with the remembrance of his pious youth.

Renans definition of a nation has been extremely influential. This was given in his 1882 discourse Quest-ce quune nation . Whereas German writers like Fichte had defined the nation by objective criteria such as a race or an ethnic group sharing common characteristics Renan defined it by the desire of a people to live together which he summarized by a famous phrase avoir fait de grandes choses ensemble vouloir en faire encore . Writing in the midst of the dispute concerning the Alsace-Lorraine region he declared that the existence of a nation was based on a daily plebiscite. Some authors criticize that definition based on a daily plebiscite because of the ambiguity of the concept. They argue that this definition is an idealization and it should be interpreted within the German tradition and not in opposition to it. They say that the arguments used by Renan at the conference What is a Nation are not consistent with his thinking.

Karl Deutsch suggested that a nation is a group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbors. This phrase is frequently but mistakenly attributed to Renan himself. He did indeed write that if the essential element of a nation is that all its individuals must have many things in common they must also have forgotten many things. Every French citizen must have forgotten the night of St. Bartholomew and the massacres in the 13th century in the South.

Renan believed Nations are not eternal. They had a beginning and they will have an end. And they will probably be replaced by a European confederation.

Renans work has especially influenced 20th-century theorist of nationalism Benedict Anderson.

Shifting away from his pessimism regarding liberalisms prospects during the 1870s while still believing in the necessity of an intellectual elite to influence democratic society for the good Renan rallied to support the French Third Republic humorously describing himself as a légitimiste that is a person who needs about ten years to accustom myself to regarding any government as legitimate and adding I who am not a republican a priori who am a simple Liberal quite willing to adjust myself to a constitutional monarchy would be more loyal to the Republic than newly converted republicans. The progress of the sciences under the Republic and the latitude given to the freedom of thought that Renan cherished above all had allayed many of his previous fears and he opposed the deterministic and fatalist theories of philosophers like Hippolyte Taine.

As he got older he contemplated his childhood. He was nearly sixty when in 1883 he published the autobiographical Souvenirs dEnfance et de Jeunesse which after the Life of Jesus is the work by which he is chiefly known.

They showed the blasé modern reader that a world no less poetic no less primitive than that of the Origins of Christianity still existed within living memory on the northwestern coast of France. It has the Celtic magic of ancient romance and the simplicity the naturalness and the veracity which the 19th century prized so highly. But his Ecclesiastes published a few months earlier his Drames Philosophiques collected in 1888 give a more adequate image of his fastidious critical disenchanted yet optimistic spirit. They show the attitude towards uncultured Socialism of a philosopher liberal by conviction by temperament an aristocrat. We learn in them how Caliban the mindless brute educated to his own responsibility makes after all an adequate ruler; how Prospero accepts his dethronement for the sake of greater liberty in the intellectual world since Caliban proves an effective policeman and leaves his superiors a free hand in the laboratory; how Ariel acquires a firmer hold on life and no longer gives up the ghost at the faintest hint of change. Indeed Ariel flourishes in the service of Prospero under the external government of the many-headed brute. Religion and knowledge are as imperishable as the world they dignify. Thus out of the depths rises unvanquished the essential idealism of Renan.

Renan was a great worker. At sixty years of age having finished the Origins of Christianity he began his History of Israel based on a lifelong study of the Old Testament and on the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum published by the Académie des Inscriptions under Renans direction from the year 1881 till the end of his life. The first volume of the History of Israel appeared in 1887; the third in 1891; the last two posthumously. As a history of facts and theories the book has many faults; as an essay on the evolution of the religious idea it is of extraordinary importance; as a reflection of the mind of Renan it is the most lifelike of images. In a volume of collected essays Feuilles Détachées published also in 1891 we find the same mental attitude an affirmation of the necessity of piety independent of dogma. During his last years he received many honors and was made an administrator of the Collège de France and grand officer of the Legion of Honor. Two volumes of the History of Israel his correspondence with his sister Henriette his Letters to M. Berthelot and the History of the Religious Policy of Philippe-le-Bel which he wrote in the years immediately before his marriage all appeared during the last eight years of the 19th century.

Renan died after a few days illness in 1892 in Paris and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter.

Hugely influential in his lifetime Renan was eulogised after his death as the embodiment of the progressive spirit in western culture. Anatole France wrote that Renan was the incarnation of modernity. Renans works were read and appreciated by many of the leading literary figures of the time including James Joyce Marcel Proust Matthew Arnold Edith Wharton and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve. One of his greatest admirers was Manuel González Prada in Peru who took the Life of Jesus as a basis for his anticlericalism. In his 1932 document The Doctrine of Fascism Italian dictator Benito Mussolini also applauded perceived prefascist intuitions in a section of Renans Meditations that argued against democracy and individual rights as chimerical and intrinsically opposed to natures plans.

In 1903 a major controversy accompanied the installation of a monument in Tréguier designed by Jean Boucher. Placed in the local cathedral square it was interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism and led to widespread protests especially because the site was normally used for the temporary pulpit erected at the traditional Catholic festival of the Pardon of St Yves. It also included the Greek goddess Athena raising her arm to crown Renan gesturing in apparent challenge towards the cathedral. The local clergy organised a protest calvary sculpture designed by Yves Hernot as a symbol of the triumphant ultramontaine church.

Renan believed that racial characteristics were instinctual and deterministic. He has been criticised for his claims that the Semitic race is inferior to the Aryan race. Renan claimed that the Semitic mind was limited by dogmatism and lacked a cosmopolitan conception of civilisation. For Renan Semites were an incomplete race. Some authors argue that Renan developed his antisemitism from Voltaires anti-Judaism.

He did not regard the Ashkenazi Jews of Europe as being a Semitic people; Renan is credited with launching the so-called Khazar theory. This theory states that Ashkenazim had their origin in Turkic refugees that had converted to Judaism and later migrated from the collapsed Khazar Khanate westward into the Rhineland and exchanged their native Khazar language for the Yiddish language while continuing to practice the Jewish religion. In his 1883 lecture Le Judaïsme comme race et comme religion he disputed the concept that Jewish people constitute a unified racial entity in a biological sense which made his views unpalatable within racial antisemitism. Renan was also known for being a strong critic of German ethnic nationalism with its antisemitic undertones. His notions of race and ethnicity were completely at odds with the European antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Renan wrote the following about the long history of persecution of Jews

When all nations and all ages have persecuted you there must be some motive behind it all. The Jew up to our own time insinuated himself everywhere claiming the protection of the common law; but in reality remaining outside the common law. He retained his own status; he wished to have the same guarantees as everyone else and over and above that his own exceptions and special laws. He desired the advantages of the nations without being a nation without helping to bear the burdens of the nations. No people has ever been able to tolerate this. The nations are military creations founded and maintained by the sword; they are the work of peasants and soldiers; towards establishing them the Jews have contributed nothing. Herein is the great fallacy inspired in Israelite pretensions. The tolerated alien can be useful to a country but only on condition that the country does not allow itself to be invaded by him. It is not fair to claim family rights in a house which one has not built like those birds which come and take up their quarters in a nest which does not belong to them or like the crustaceans which steal the shell of another species.

However during the 1880s Renan shifted away from these views. In a lecture on Judaism as a Race and as a Religion he stated

When in 1791 the National Assembly decreed the emancipation of the Jews it concerned itself very little with race. It considered that men ought to be judged not by the blood that runs in their veins but by their moral and intellectual value. It is the glory of France to take these questions by their human side. The work of the nineteenth century is to tear down every ghetto and I have no praise for those who seek to rebuild them. The Israelite race has in the past rendered the greatest services to the world. Blended with the different nations in harmony with the diverse national unities of Europe it will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. By its collaboration with all the liberal forces of Europe it will contribute eminently to the social progress of humanity.

And in 1883 in a lecture called The Original Identity and Gradual Separation of Judaism and Christianity

Judaism which has served so well in the past will still serve in the future. It will serve the true cause of liberalism of the modern spirit. Every Jew is a liberal ... The enemies of Judaism however if you only look at them more closely you will see that they are the enemies of the modern spirit in general.

Other comments on race have also proven controversial especially his belief that political policy should take into account supposed racial differences

Nature has made a race of workers the Chinese race who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honor... A race of tillers of the soil the Negro; treat him with kindness and humanity and all will be as it should; a race of masters and soldiers the European race. Reduce this noble race to working in the ergastulum like Negroes and Chinese and they rebel... But the life at which our workers rebel would make a Chinese or a fellah happy as they are not military creatures in the least. Let each one do what he is made for and all will be well.

This passage among others was cited by Aimé Césaire in his Discourse on Colonialism as evidence of the alleged hypocrisy of Western humanism and its sordidly racist conception of the rights of man.

During the arising of racism theories around Europe and specifically in FranceFrench Republic Renan had an important influence on the matter. He was a defender of peoples self-determination concept but on the other hand was in fact convinced of a racial hierarchy of peoples that he said was established. Discursively he subordinated the principle of self-determination of peoples to a racial hierarchy i.e. he supported the colonialist expansion and the racist view of the Third Republic because he believed the French to be hierarchically superior to the African nations. This subtle racism called by Gilles Manceron Republican racism was common in France during the Third Republic and was also a well-known defensing discourse in politics. Supporters of colonialism used the concept of cultural superiority and described themselves as protectors of civilization to justify their colonial actions and territorial expansion."
Jacques Rennes,Jacques Rennes was a French philosopher and veterinarian.
Charles Renouvier,"Charles Bernard Renouvier was a French philosopher. He considered himself a Swedenborg of history who sought to update the philosophy of Kantian liberalism and individualism for the socio-economic realities of the late nineteenth century and influenced the sociological method of Émile Durkheim.

Renouvier was born in Montpellier and educated in Paris at the École Polytechnique. He took an early interest in politics but never held public office spending his time writing away from public scrutiny.

Renouvier was the first French philosopher after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kants as his chosen term néo-criticisme indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.

The two leading ideas are the dislike of the unknowable in all its forms and a reliance on the validity of personal experience. The former accounts for Renouviers acceptance of Kants phenomenalism combined with rejection of the thing-in-itself. It accounts too for his polemic on the one hand against a Substantial Soul a Buddhistic Absolute an Infinite Spiritual Substance; on the other hand against the no less mysterious material or dynamic substratum by which naturalistic Monism explains the world. He maintains that nothing exists except presentations which are not merely sensational and have an objective aspect no less than a subjective. To explain the formal organization of our experience Renouvier adopts a modified version of the Kantian categories.

The insistence on the validity of personal experience leads Renouvier to a yet more important divergence from Kant in his treatment of volition. Liberty he says in a much wider sense than Kant is mans fundamental characteristic. Human freedom acts in the phenomenal not in an imaginary noumenal sphere. Belief is not merely intellectual but is determined by an act of will affirming what we hold to be morally good.

In his religious views Renouvier makes a considerable approximation to Gottfried Leibniz. He holds that we are rationally justified in affirming human immortality and the existence of a finite God who is to be a constitutional ruler but not a despot over the souls of people. He nevertheless regards atheism as preferable to a belief in an infinite Deity.

Renouviers dislike of the unknowable also led him to take up arms against the notion of an actual infinite. He believed that an infinite sum must be a name for something incomplete. If one begins to count one two three ... there never comes a time when one is entitled to shout infinity Infinity is a project never a fact in the neocritical view.

Renouvier became an important influence upon the thought of American psychologist and philosopher William James. James wrote that but for the decisive impression made on me in the 1870s by his masterly advocacy of pluralism I might never have got free from the monistic superstition under which I had grown up."
Jean-François Revel,"Jean-François Revel was a French philosopher journalist and author. A prominent public intellectual Revel was a socialist in his youth but later became a prominent European proponent of classical liberalism and free market economics. He was a member of the Académie française after June 1998. He is best known for his book Without Marx or Jesus The New American Revolution Has Begun published in French in 1970.

Jean-François Ricard was born in Marseille in 1924 into a prosperous middle-class family. During the German occupation of France in World War II the adolescent Ricard participated in the French Resistance. He would later note that his reaction against the disgraceful officious manner of French collaborators had an impact on his approach to writing. Ricard began to use Revel as a literary pseudonym eventually adopting it as his legal surname.

Revel moved to Lyon to prepare at the Lycée du Parc for the competitive entrance examination to the École normale supérieure where he was admitted in 1943. At the ENS Revel studied philosophy and in 1956 passed the rigorous agrégation that qualified him to teach the subject in French public secondary schools.

Revel began his career teaching philosophy in French Algeria and in French secondary schools in Italy and Mexico before settling in Lille. He quit teaching in 1963 and embarked on his career a journalist author and public intellectual. Among other positions in the press he was chief literary editor for France Observateur and later for LExpress.

A socialist until the late 1960s Revel was a speechwriter for socialist politician François Mitterrand. Revel ran as a socialist candidate in the parliamentary elections of 1967 which he lost. Later however Revel became known particularly in the context of the Cold War as a champion of classical liberal values such as liberty and democracy at a time when many pre-eminent European intellectuals praised Communism or Maoism. The publication of his 1970 book Without Marx or Jesus The New American Revolution Has Begun signalled the transition of his views to liberal philosopher of freedom in the tradition of Raymond Aron. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.

In 1975 he delivered the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden Netherlands under the title La tentation totalitaire . In 1986 Revel he received an honorary doctorate degree from the Universidad Francisco Marroquín in Guatemala for his commitment to individual freedom. From 1998 to 2006 he was president of the Institut dHistoire Sociale. His successor is Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.

A year after the September 11 attacks of 2001 Revel published Anti-Americanism a book in which he criticized anti-Americanism and Europeans who argued that the United States had brought the terrorist attacks upon itself by misguided foreign policies Obsessed by their hatred and floundering in illogicality these dupes forget that the United States acting in its own self-interest is also acting in the interest of us Europeans and in the interests of many other countries which are threatened or have already been subverted and ruined by terrorism.

He is survived by his second wife Claude Sarraute a journalist and has three sons from two marriages. His first marriage to painter Yahne le Toumelin ended in divorce.

One of his sons Matthieu Ricard is a well-known Buddhist monk who studied molecular biology at the Pasteur Institute before converting to Tibetan Buddhism. Father and son jointly authored a book Le moine et le philosophe about the sons conversion and Buddhism. Another son Nicolas Revel is a high-ranking functionary in the French civil service and as of 2020 the director of the cabinet of the Prime Minister of France.

Belgian-Australian essayist and sinologist Simon Leys notes that ...what strikingly set apart from most other intellectuals of his generation was his genuinely cosmopolitan outlook as on international affairs on literature art and ideas he had universal perspectives that broke completely from the suffocating provincialism of the contemporary Parisian elites.

Of Revels political thought Clive James wrote that while he was always characterized by the bien pensant left as a die-hard right-winger he was in fact a liberal democrat who was genuinely concerned that doctrinaire gauchiste measures would leave the underprivileged less privileged than ever.

In his book Cultural Amnesia Clive James writes that no political commentator anywhere is so consistently entertaining on such a high level arguing that he writes in a style that is gratifyingly clear in its structure memorable for its vivid imagery and consistently funny.

In 2006 journalist and former editor-in-chief of Lire Magazine Pierre Boncenne published Pour Jean-François Revel which received the Renaudot Prize for Essays.

In 2018 Jean-François Revel was included by Mario Vargas Llosa in his essay The Call of The Tribe which explores liberalism and the works of liberal thinkers that influenced Vargas Llosa."
Judith Revel,"Judith Revel is a French philosopher and translator.

Daughter of the historian and former president of the EHESS Jacques Revel former student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-Saint-Cloud Judith Revel is a specialist in contemporary French and Italian thoughts.

After a first doctorate of philosophy obtained in Italy she supported in France a doctoral thesis in philosophy under the direction of Marcel Gauchet . She was a lecturer at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and is now Professor of Contemporary Philosophy at the University Paris-Nanterre since 2014. She is a member of the laboratory Sophiapol.

She is a member of the Michel Foucault Center the scientific council of IMEC the scientific council of the International College of Philosophy. She lives with her partner Antonio Negri the Italian philosopher.

Her research started from the thought of Michel Foucault to whom she has devoted a dictionary several books and many articles especially around two themes - the relationship between philosophy of language and literature Foucaults opposition to idealism and the transition from biopolitics to subjectivation . She is linked to the work of the American philosopher Arnold Davidson with whom she has in common an attempt to update the ethico-political Foucaldian themes.

After the 2005 French riots she wrote a book about the so-called banlieues criticizing both the clichés that surrounds its inhabitants and the growth of racism in the French society. She analysed the refusal to give any political value to what was happening in the suburbs by deconstructing racist implicit images of public speeches .

Since the beginning of 2010 she has been working more generally on the philosophy of history and especially the way in which a certain practice of philosophy has problematized both its own historical situation and the possibility of intervening in the present. In this context she develops a work on the philosophical use of archives especially through teachings and seminars at the EHESS. More generally she studied the different representations of history in French thought since the 1950s.

It also extends its investigation of some Italian readings of French poststructuralism . Finally she develops a series of theses on the political theorizations before and after 1968 and on the necessary recasting of the political concepts of modernity in the silage of Italian operaism and more particularly the analyzes of the philosopher Toni Negri who is also her husband. She works in particular on the notion of common as an alternative to the public private dichotomy and on a political ontology of the present building bridges between Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Michel Foucault."
Jean Reynaud,"Jean Reynaud was a French socialist philosopher.

He was a member of the Saint-Simonian community. He was a co-founder of the Encyclopédie nouvelle."
Paul Ricœur,"Jean Paul Gustave Ricœur was a French philosopher best known for combining phenomenological description with hermeneutics. As such his thought is within the same tradition as other major hermeneutic phenomenologists Martin Heidegger Hans-Georg Gadamer and Gabriel Marcel. In 2000 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for having revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology biblical exegesis psychoanalysis theory of metaphor and narrative theory.

Paul Ricœur was born in 1913 in Valence Drôme France to Léon Jules Ricœur and Florentine Favre who were married on 30 December 1910 in Lyon. He came from a family of devout Huguenots a religious minority in France.

Pauls father Jules who served as a sergeant in the 75th Infantry Regiment of the French army during World War I went missing in Perthes-lès-Hurlus near the beginning of the Second Battle of Champagne . On 26 September 1915 French military authorities declared that Jules had probably been killed in the battle. His body was not found until 1932 when a field was being ploughed and the body was identified by its tags. Some writers have stated that before World War I began Pauls father was a professor of English at the Lycée Emile Loubet in Valence. However it was a different person Jules Paul Ricœur who held that position. Pauls fathers death occurred when Paul was only two years old. Subsequently Paul was raised in Rennes France by his paternal grandparents Louis Ricœur and his wife Marie Sarradet and by his fathers sister Juliette Adèle Ricœur with a small stipend afforded to Paul as a war orphan.

Paul whose penchant for study was fueled by his familys Protestant emphasis on Bible study was bookish and intellectually precocious. He discovered philosophy while attending the Lycée de Rennes titled Problème de Dieu chez Lachelier et Lagneau concerning some of the theological views of French philosophers Jules Lachelier and Jules Lagneau . In 1935 Paul was awarded the second-highest agrégation mark in the nation for philosophy presaging a bright future.

On 14 August 1935 in Rennes Paul married Simone Lejas with whom he had five children Jean-Paul Marc Noëlle Olivier and Etienne . In 193637 he fulfilled his military service.

World War II interrupted Ricœurs career and he was drafted to serve in the French army in 1939. His unit was captured during the German invasion of France in 1940 and he spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in Oflag II-D. His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as Mikel Dufrenne who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree-granting institution by the Vichy government. During that time he read Karl Jaspers who was to have a great influence on him. He also began a translation of Edmund Husserls Ideas I.

Ricœur taught at the University of Strasbourg between 1948 and 1956 the only French university with a Protestant faculty of theology. In 1950 he received his State doctorate submitting two theses a minor thesis translating Husserls Ideas I into French for the first time with commentary and a major thesis that he published the same year as Philosophie de la Volonté I Le Volontaire et lInvolontaire . Ricœur soon acquired a reputation as an expert on phenomenology then the ascendent philosophy in France.

In 1956 Ricœur took up a position at the Sorbonne as the Chair of General Philosophy. This appointment signaled Ricœurs emergence as one of Frances most prominent philosophers. While at the Sorbonne he wrote three works that cemented his reputation Fallible Man and The Symbolism of Evil published in 1960 and Freud and Philosophy An Essay on Interpretation published in 1965. Jacques Derrida was an assistant to Ricœur during that time .

From 1965 to 1970 Ricœur was an administrator at the newly founded University of Nanterre in suburban Paris. Nanterre was intended as an experiment in progressive education and Ricœur hoped that he could create a university in accordance with his vision free of the stifling atmosphere of the tradition-bound Sorbonne and its overcrowded classes. Nevertheless Nanterre became a hotbed of protest during the student uprisings of May 1968 in France. Ricœur was derided as an old clown and tool of the French government.

Disenchanted with French academic life Ricœur taught briefly at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in The Rule of Metaphor Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language published in 1975 and the three-volume Time and Narrative published in 1983 1984 1985 Ricœur gave the Gifford Lectures in 198586 published in 1990 as Oneself as Another. This work built on his discussion of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.

Time and Narrative secured Ricœurs return to France in 1985 as a notable intellectual. His late work was characterised by a continuing cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions; for example some of his latest writing engaged the thought of the American political philosopher John Rawls. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.

In 1999 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Philosophy the citation being or his capacity in bringing together all the most important themes and indications of 20th-century philosophy and re-elaborating them into an original synthesis which turns language in particular that which is poetic and metaphoric into a chosen place revealing a reality that we cannot manipulate but interpret in diverse ways and yet all coherent. Through the use of metaphor language draws upon that truth which makes of us that what we are deep in the profundity of our own essence. That same year he and his co-author André LaCocque were awarded the Gordon J. Laing Award by the University of Chicagos Board of University Publications for their book Thinking Biblically Exegetical and Hermeneutical Studies.

On 29 November 2004 he was awarded with the second John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences .

Ricœur died on 20 May 2005 aged 92 at his home in Châtenay-Malabry France of natural causes. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that the humanist European tradition is in mourning for one of its most talented exponents. Paul Ricœur was buried in the Châtenay-Malabry New Cemetery Châtenay-Malabry Department des Hauts-de-Seine Île-de-France France.

Ricoeur maintains that the hermeneutical task is a coming together of the self and an other in a meaningful way. This explication of self-meaning and other-meaning is principally bound up and manifested in existence itself. Thus Ricoeur depicts philosophy as a hermeneutical activity seeking to uncover the meaning of existence through the interpretation of phenomena embedded in the world of culture 

Furthermore the process of hermeneutics and extracting meaning is a reflective task. The emphasis is not on the external meaning but the meaning or insight of the self which is gained through encountering the external textor other. The self-knowledge gained through the hermeneutical process is thus indirectly attained. This is in opposition to the Cartesian cogito which grasps itself directly in the experience of doubt and is a truth as vain as it is invincible. In point of fact the difference Ricœur aims to distinguish is the means by which the self is discovered which for him is only by means of interpreting the signified.

According to Ricœur the aim of hermeneutics is to recover and to restore the meaning. The French philosopher chooses the model of the phenomenology of religion in relation to psychoanalysis stressing that it is characterized by a concern on the object. This object is the sacred which is seen in relation to the profane.

Ricœurs hermeneutical work Freud and Philosophy contains the famous assertion that Karl Marx Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud are masters of the school of suspicion . Marx is reductionist because he reduces society to economy particularly to means of production; Nietzsche is a reductionist because he reduces man to the will-to-power and an arbitrary concept of superman; Freud is a reductionist because he reduces human nature to sexual instinct. Ricœurs theory has been particularly influential to postcritique a scholarly movement in literary criticism and cultural studies that seeks for new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique critical theory and ideological criticism. The literary critic Rita Felski for instance argues that he is a crucial figure in the history of this tradition. She claims that his influential analysis of the hermeneutics of suspicion invites us to think about how we read and to what end.

In The Rule of Metaphor and in Time and Narrative vol. 1 Ricœur argues that there exists a linguistic productive imagination that generatesregenerates meaning through the power of metaphoricity by way of stating things in novel ways and as a consequence he sees language as containing within itself resources that allow it to be used creatively."
Pierre A. Riffard,"Pierre A. Riffard is a French philosopher and specialist in esotericism. Born in Toulouse he is a professor of pedagogy and philosophy at the University of the French West Indies and Guiana .Teaching in the French overseas departments and territories and elsewhere Asia Oceania Sub-Saharan Africa Guiana.

For Pierre A. Riffard esotericism is occult teaching doctrine or theory technique or process of symbolic expression of a metaphysical nature of initiatory intent. Druidism compagnonnage alchemy are esotericisms.

Pierre A. Riffard defended a Doctor of Philosophy thesis on the Greek formula ἓν καὶ πᾶν then a Doctor of Arts thesis on LIdée désotérisme 1997. As soon as 87 he proposed nine invariants for defining an esotericism

As regards form esotericists have a secret paralipsis . They purport to say nothing while at the same time discreetly revealing something . For example symbols such as the apple or the coiled serpent reveal numerous clues or keys to sexuality while simultaneously appearing to obfuscate the discourse or image.

As regards content esotericists have another secret reversion. They reverse ordinary ideas they turn around commonplace behaviour they overturn shared emotions to return to the original. For example kundalini yoga sends sexual energy up to the brain and the alchemist returns to primary matter when everything becomes possible and powerful again.

As regards sense esotericists have no secrets; they just adopt a lifestyle one which gives priority to the interior of things. For example in love they prefer a state of consciousness higher than sexual pleasure; in alchemy they are more interested in the solar image of gold than its market value.Riffards approach may thus be characterized as universalist religionistic and trans-historical Esotericism is a basic anthropological structure and as such not dependent on cultural mediation. Its scope in time and space includes the whole of human history. -Wouter J. Hanegraaff.

Pierre A. Riffard recently published essays examining the lifestyle of philosophers from a psychological and sociological point of view . In Les philosophes vie intime he draws attention to some of the philosophers human traits which are not generally mentioned covering everyone from Thales to Sartre

Thanatology is the study of death among human beings.

Raising the issue of the afterlife is no plain matter something like I believe in Paradise. It actually is a speculative strategy a rational reckoning combining several concepts and requiring a number of successive choices. It looks like a decision tree

As for the afterlife itself several problems arise. First of all problems of method.

A - Should one negate or assert or suspend ones opinion on the afterlife

B Who survives a single individual an elite a community Humanity the World 

C - What survives the soul a soul the mind the Self...

D- Under what shape some specific element in the individual some universal element...

E Since when the death of the individual Doomsday...

G What type of time cyclical over an evolutionary period...

I Following which law Gods Will Chance Ones karma...

J What types of survival reincarnation resurrection...

K to what ultimate end fusing into God dissolution of the Self...

The Christian view of life after death is a combination of assertions the afterlife is a fact humanity is concerned spiritualism Doomsday ... and resurrectionSkepticism and scientism bring reflection to an abrupt ending through the suspension of judgment it agrees with Wilder Penfields words Whether energy can come to the mind of man from an outside source after his death is for each individual to decide for himself. Science has no such answer .

All things considered about a dozen ascertained types of survival are possible; they may either co-exist or follow one another and may vary according to the individuals the souls the actions. The history of religions mainly highlights a few types neutral form of life shadow existence demonic life damnation or salvation migration of the souls through metempsychosis or reincarnation catasterisation palingenesis eternal return ."
Léon Robin,"Léon Robin was a French philosopher and scholar of Greek philosophy professor of history of ancient philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1924 to 1936.

Robin the son of a merchant began teaching in the Faculty of Letters at Paris in 1913. In 1924 he took up the chair of history of ancient philosophy which had lapsed after the death of Louis Rodier in 1913. In 1927 he was visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania. On his retirement from the Paris chair his successor was Pierre-Maxime Schuhl. Robin subsequently served as Director of the International Institute of Philosophy.

Léon Robin translated the dialogues of Plato into French."
Jean-Baptiste Robinet,"Jean-Baptiste Robinet also known as Jean-Baptiste-René Robinet was a French naturalist known for his five-volume work De la nature . He was also involved in the sequel publications to the Encyclopédie took on Diderots editorial role and was a translator of numerous works to the French language.

Robinet was born in Rennes on 23 June 1735 and died there on 24 March 1820. Early in life he was educated by the Jesuits and embraced the rule of St. Ignatius but soon regretted his loss of freedom and entered the world of letters. He traveled to Holland to publish his book De la nature which in time gained notoriety due to the peculiar opinions presented in the book. Upon his return to Paris in 1778 he was appointed royal censor and private secretary to Antoine-Jean Amelot de Chaillou. During the French revolution he lost all employment and retired to his home where he lived in relative seclusion occupied only with family duties. He had been a disciple of encyclopédistes but was also committed to the principles of the church. He eventually returned to the church and signed a recantation of his errors.

Robinet is one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought who contributed to the process which later crystallized in the work of Charles Darwin. Jean-Baptiste was led from observations into the idea of the transmutation of species and so into a theory of evolution which in some important respects anticipated modern ideas. In De la nature published in 1761 Nature was not God but necessarily and eternally evolved from Divine essence. Creation is the everlasting work of the Deity who from eternity has been working and smoothly progressing in the manner of Nature. There are no leaps. All things must have come from unity which has been infinitely diversified. Kingdoms classes and species are artificial works of man of which Nature knows nothing. The orangutan was next to man in the scale of being. All the links of Natures chain may not yet have been discovered but they would be discovered before long.

Robinet represented a teleological point of view in his discussions on evolution. All was produced from a divine pre-existing and static master-plan. He wrote that in diverse lower animals Nature advances groping towards the excellence of the human being. Some imperceptible progress is made at each step each new production a variation of the primitive design becoming very responsive after a number of metamorphoses. The development of the human machine had taken a long succession of arrangements compositions and dissolutions additions and deletions alterations cancellations and changes of all kinds.

Robinet in collaboration with Charles-Joseph Panckoucke were exponents of the Encyclopédie and published a supplement to it in four volumes . He also participated in the publication of one of the first works of its kind the thirty volume social science dictionary Dictionnaire universel des sciences morales économique politique et diplomatique; ou bibliothèque de lhomme dÉtat et du citoyen created as a library of statesmen and citizens. Robinet also published numerous translations into French in particular works by David Hume and Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He was probably the translator of Humes Essays Moral and Political and drew heavily upon it in his Considerations sur létat présent de la littérature en Europe."
Gabriel Rockhill,"Gabriel Rockhill is a French-American philosopher writer cultural critic and activist. He is Professor of Philosophy at Villanova University Founder and Director of the Critical Theory WorkshopAtelier de Théorie Critique and former Directeur de programme at the Collège International de Philosophie.

Best known for his innovative scholarly work in the fields of history aesthetics and politics he is also a regular contributor to public intellectual debate and his writings have circulated widely in venues such as CounterPunch Black Agenda Report the New York Times Libération and the Los Angeles Review of Books.

Gabriel Rockhill graduated from Grinnell College in 1995. He earned a masters degree under the direction of Jacques Derrida and Luce Irigaray from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences and a Ph.D. under the direction of Alain Badiou from Paris 8 University as well as a Ph.D. from Emory University.

Rockhill has advanced a new model for thinking the historical relationship between art and politics. Rather than understanding them as two spheres separated by an insurmountable divide or linked by a privileged bridge he demonstrates through historical and materialist analysis that they are not fixed entities with a singular relation but rather social practices and concepts in struggle. In books like Radical History the Politics of Art and Interventions in Contemporary Thought History Politics Aesthetics he proposes a significant departure from extant philosophical debates on what is commonly called art and politics in the name of a radically historicist analysis of the political dimensions inherent in the modes of production circulation and reception of aesthetic practices. Engaging with a diverse array of intellectual artistic and political traditions his work carefully maps interactions between different aspects of aesthetic and political practices as they intertwine and sometimes merge in specific fields of struggle.

In his earlier work Logique de lhistoire pour une analytique des pratiques philosophiques he developed an alternative logic of history and historical change which emphasizes the geographic and social dimensions of history as well as a novel account of social practices and a multidimensional theory of agency. His most recent book Contre-histoire du temps présent interrogations intempestives sur la mondialisation la technologie la démocratie expands this work to a critical analysis of the dominant image of the present moment thereby dismantling what he refers to as the historical and political imaginary of the contemporary conjuncture.

In addition to his scholarly publications Rockhill has written a number of literary pieces and political essays that have circulated widely and been translated into multiple languages including widely discussed articles like The CIA Reads French Theory in the L.A. Review of Books."

He was a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris and director of seminars at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales."
Roscellinus,"Roscelin of Compiègne better known by his Latinized name Roscellinus Compendiensis or Rucelinus was a French philosopher and theologian often regarded as the founder of nominalism.

Roscellinus was born in Compiègne France. Little is known of his life and knowledge of his doctrines is mainly derived from Anselm and Abelard.

He studied at Soissons and Reims was afterwards attached to the cathedral of Chartres and became canon of Compiègne. As a monk of Compiègne he was teaching as early as 1087. He had contact with Lanfranc Anselm and St. Ivo of Chartres.

It seems most probable that Roscellinus was not strictly the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in his exposition they received more definite expression and being applied to the dogma of the Trinity attracted universal attention.

Roscellinus maintained that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents our speaking of the three persons as three substances or three Gods. If it were otherwise and the three persons were really one substance or thing we should be forced to admit that the Father and the Holy Spirit became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems to have put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith and to have claimed for it at first the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm.

In 10921093 however a council convoked at Soissons by the archbishop of Reims condemned his interpretation and Roscellinus who was accused of tritheism recanted the doctrines attributed to him but only out of fear of excommunication and even stoning to death by the orthodox populace for later he returned to his early theories. He fled to England but having made himself unpopular by an attack on the doctrines of Anselm he left the country and repaired to Rome where he was well received and became reconciled to the Catholic Church. He then returned to France taught at Tours and Loc-menach in France and finally became canon of Besançon. He is heard of as late as 1121 when he came forward to oppose Abelards views on the Trinity. He was also sent a letter by Theobald of Étampes for having denigrated wrongfully the sons of priests.

Of his writings there exists only a letter addressed to Abelard on the Trinity in which Roscellinus belittles Abélard and makes merry over his castration.Hauréau brings forward his name in connection with a text Sententia de universalibus secundum magistrum R. but this is a conjecture. We have as evidences of his doctrine texts of Anselm Abelard John of Salisbury and an anonymous epigram. His share in the history of ideas and especially his nominalism have been exaggerated his celebrity being far more due to his theological tritheism.

According to Otto of Freisingen Roscelin primus nostris temporibus sententiam vocum instituit but the chronicler of the Historia Francia mentions before him a magister Johannes whose personality is much discussed and who has not yet been definitively identified. What constitutes the sententia vocum To judge of it we have besides the texts mentioned above which bear directly on Roscelin an exposition of the treatise De generibus et speciebus wrongly attributed to Abelard by Victor Cousin. The sententia vocum was one of the anti-Realist solutions of the problem of universals accepted by the early Middle Ages. Resuming Porphyrys alternative the first medieval philosophers regarded genera and species either as things or as having no existence and applying to this alternative a terminology of Boethius they derived thence either res or voces . To the nominalists universals were voces voices which means above all that universals are not res that is that only the individual exists nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum ... . Nominalism was essentially anti-Realist. that universals are merely words flatus vocis e.g. the word homo divisible into syllables consonants and vowels. Fuit autem nemini magistri nostri Roscellini tam insana sententia ut nullam rem partibus constare vellet sed sicut solis vocibus species ita et partes ascridebat ; Illi utique dialectici qui non nisi flatum vocis putant universalis esse substantias et qui colorem non aliud queunt intellegere quam corpus nec sapientiam hominis aliud quam animam prorsus a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi. ; Alius ergo consistit in vocibus licet haec opinio cum Roscelino suo fere omnino evanuerit . The universal is reduced to an emission of sound in conformity with Boethius definition Nihil enim aliud est prolatio quam aeris plectro linguae percussio. Roscelins universal corresponds to what is now called the universale in voce in opposition to universale in re and universale in intellectu.

But this theory of Roscelins had no connection with the abstract concept of genus and species. He did not touch on this question. It is certain that he did not deny the existence or possibility of these concepts and he was therefore not a nominalist in the fashion of Taine or in the sense in which nominalism is now understood. That is why in reference to the modern sense of the word some call it a pseudo-nominalism. John of Salisbury speaking of nominalis secta gives it quite another meaning. So Roscelins rudimentary even childish solution does not compromise the value of universal concepts and may be called a stage in the development of moderate realism. However because of his position as the first medieval philosopher to challenge medieval Realism he has been invoked as a forefather of modernity.

Roscelin was also taken to task by Anselm and Abelard for the less clear idea which he gave of the whole and of composite substance. According to Anselm he maintained that colour does not exist independently of the horse which serves as its support and that the wisdom of the soul is not outside of the soul which is wise . He denies to the whole such as house man real existence of its parts. The word alone had parts ita divinam paginam pervertit ut eo loco quo Dominus partem piscis assi comedisse partem hujus vocis quae est piscis assi non partem rei intelligere cogatur .

Roscelin was not without his supporters; among them was his contemporary Raimbert of Lille and what the monk Hériman relates of his doctrine agrees with the statements of the master of Compiègne. Universal substances says Hériman are but a breath which means eos de sapientium numero merito esse exsufflandos. He merely comments on the saying of Anselm characterized by the same jesting tone a spiritualium quaestionum disputatione sunt exsufflandi and says that to understand the windy loquacity of Raimbert of Lille one has but to breathe into his hand .

Roscelin considered the three Divine Persons as three independent beings like three angels; if usage permitted he added it might truly be said that there are three Gods. Otherwise he continued God the Father and God the Holy Ghost would have become incarnate with God the Son. To retain the appearance of dogma he admitted that the three Divine Persons had but one will and power .

This characteristic tritheism which Anselm and Abelard agreed in refuting even after its authors conversion seems an indisputable application of Roscelins anti-Realism. He even argues that if the three Divine Persons form but one God all three have become incarnate. There are therefore three Divine substances three Gods as there are three angels because each substance constitutes an individual which is the fundamental assertion of anti-Realism. The ideas of the theologian are closely linked with those of the philosopher."
Alexis Rosenbaum,"Alexis Rosenbaum is a French essayist. After studying philosophy and psychology at the University of Paris-Sorbonne he graduated with a dissertation on hierarchical representations in the history of philosophy. He currently teaches at the Polytechnic Institute of Paris.

Most of Rosenbaums multidisciplinary works are meant to put modes of comparison into historical perspective. The sacred order questions the importance of hierarchical images in the history of western philosophy. Stressing the importance of platonic traditions Rosenbaum argues that stratification is the prevailing mode of comparison in antique and medieval philosophy. He acknowledges the decline of hierarchical images during the European Renaissance but contends that this decline is misleading as hierarchical representations have been surviving in more discreet ways ever since.The fear of inferiority investigates the historical changes in procedures of social comparison highlighting the peculiarities of the contemporary system of overcomparison. The influence of Alfred Adlers thought on this work is undeniable. Through the expectation of personal success the intensification of envy and the invasion of measures it is argued subjects of nonhierarchical societies are constantly comparing to each other and prone to feelings of inferiority.In Antisemitism Rosenbaum tries to show how this permanent and ubiquitous social jealousy frames the modern forms of antisemitism.In Vivid memories lastly the question of the collective components of pride or humiliation is tackled. Drawing on social comparison theory Rosenbaum maintains that History of ones group is a major resource for individuals seeking to gain or regain self-esteem. The emergence of competing memories in multicultural countries like France or the U.S. is then traced back to social comparison processes."
Clément Rosset,"Clément Rosset was a French philosopher and writer. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis and the author of books on 20th-century philosophy and postmodern philosophy.

Rosset was born on 12 October 1939 in Barneville-Carteret France. He graduated from the École Normale Supérieure and he passed the agrégation of philosophy in 1965.

Rosset taught French at the Université de Montréal in Quebec Canada for two years. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in Nice France until his retirement in the late 1990s.

The bulk of his work consists in some 30 short books all of them brief studies or essays on various topics. Most popular is probably Le réel et son double that deals in an original manner with the inevitably illusionistic character of representations. Arthur Schopenhauer on whom Rosset has published a few studies remains a constant reference throughout his works. The fight with depression introduced a more personal strain in the later writings of Clément Rosset."
Jean Rostand,"Jean Edmond Cyrus Rostand was a French biologist and philosopher.

Louis Rougier,"Louis Auguste Paul Rougier was a French philosopher. Rougier made many important contributions to epistemology philosophy of science political philosophy and the history of Christianity.

Rougier was born in Lyon. Debilitated by pleurisy in his youth he was declared unfit for service in World War I and devoted his adolescence to intellectual pursuits.

After receiving the agrégation de philosophie degree from the University of Lyon Rougier taught until 1924 at various lycées and obtained his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1920. His doctoral thesis work was published that year as La philosophie géometrique de Poincaré and Les paralogismes du rationalisme. Rougier already had several publications to his name however beginning with a 1914 paper on the use of non-Euclidean geometry in relativity theory.

Rougier taught in Algiers from 19171920 and then in Rome from 1920 to 1924. His first university appointment in France was at the University of Besançon in 1925 where he served on the faculty until his dismissal in 1948 for political reasons. Further university appointments were in Cairo from 193136 the New School for Social Research from 194143 and the Université de Montréal in 1945. Rougiers final academic appointment was to the Université de Caen in 1954 but he retired at the age of 66 after only one year there.

Rougier lived to the age of 93 and was survived by his third wife Lucy Friedman. Dr. Friedman whom he married in 1942 was a former secretary to Moritz Schlick. Although Friedman had a daughter from a previous marriage Rougier himself had no children.

Under the influence of Henri Poincaré and Wittgenstein Rougier developed a philosophy based on the idea that systems of logic are neither apodictic nor assertoric Instead Rougier proposed that the various systems of logic are simply conventions that are adopted based on contingent circumstances.

This view which implies that there are no objective a priori truths that exist independently of the human mind closely resembled the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Many members of this group including Philipp Frank greatly admired Rougiers 1920 work Les paralogismes du rationalisme. Rougier soon became the groups only French associate and formed close personal ties to several of its leading members including Moritz Schlick and Hans Reichenbach. Rougier also participated as an organizer and contributor to many Vienna Circle activities including the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Rougiers own contribution to the Encyclopedia never materialized however because he soon became one of many participants who ended up quarreling with Otto Neurath the projects editor-in-chief.

Rougiers conventionalist philosophical position naturally led him to oppose Neo-Thomism which had been the official philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church since the 1879 encyclical Aeterna Patris but was gaining particular momentum during the 1920s and 1930s. Rougier published several works during this period attacking this contemporary revival of scholasticism thereby earning the personal enmity of prominent Thomists such as Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain.

Rougiers objections to Neo-Thomism were not merely philosophical however but formed part of a general opposition to Christianity that he had already begun to develop during his adolescence under the influence of Ernest Renan. This early opposition to Christianity continued to influence intellectual work of Rougiers maturity leading him in 1926 to publish a translation of Celsus that is still in use today.

Rougier was also a political philosopher in the liberal tradition of Montesquieu Constant Guizot and Tocqueville. Consistent with his conventionalist epistemology Rougier believed that political power rests not upon eternally valid claims but upon conventions that he called mystiques. The only possible reason to prefer one political system over another he believed depends not on eternal truths but on purely pragmatic grounds. In other words political systems should be chosen not based on how true they are but rather on how well they work.

After visiting the Soviet Union in 1932 on a visit sponsored by Frances Ministry of Education Rougier became convinced that planned economies do not work as well as market economies. This conviction led him to participate in the organization of the first neoliberal organization of the twentieth century the Colloque Walter Lippmann in 1938. During the same year Rougier helped to found the Centre international détudes pour la rénovation du libéralisme. The political network established by these two groups eventually led to the 1947 foundation of the famous Mont Pelerin Society to which Rougier was elected in the 1960s through the personal backing of Friedrich von Hayek.

Rougier as one of the founding fathers of neoliberalism would no doubt have been admitted to the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society had it not been for a second political engagement that proved disastrous to his career and reputation his activities on behalf of the Vichy regime in France during World War II. In October 1940 Philippe Pétain sent Rougier on a secret mission to the British government in London where he met with Winston Churchill between 21-25 October. 

Rougier later claimed in several published works that these meetings resulted in an agreement between Vichy and Churchill that he called the Mission secrète à Londres les Accords Pétain-Churchill an allegation that the British government later denied in an official White Paper. Although these activities and publications eventually led to Rougiers dismissal in 1948 from his teaching position at the University of Besançon Rougier continued to be active throughout the 1950s in organizations that defended Pétain. He also published works denouncing the épuration as illegal and totalitarian. Finally Rougier was active in an effort that petitioned the United Nations in 1951 alleging that the Allies had committed human rights violations and war crimes during the Libération.

During the 1970s Rougier formed a second controversial political alliance with the Nouvelle Droite of the French writer Alain de Benoist. Rougiers long-standing opposition to Christianity together with his conviction that the West possesses a pragmatically superior mentalité to those of other cultures aligned closely with the views of this movement. Benoist reissued and wrote prefaces to several of Rougiers earlier works and in 1974 Benoists think tank GRECE published an entirely new book by Rougier Le conflit du Christianisme primitif et de la civilisation antique."
Joseph Rovan,"Joseph Adolphe Rovan was a French philosopher and politician and is considered a spiritual father of post-war Europe. Initially born into the Jewish faith on Whitsunday 1944 he was received into the Catholic Church.

Rovan was active in the French Resistance during World War II and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance for his services. In 1944 he was arrested by the Gestapo and survived 10 months in the Dachau concentration camp. It was during this time that he converted to Catholicism. In 1945 after his return to France he wrote in the magazine Esprit the article LAllemagne de nos mérites where he suggested that the creation of a democratic Germany on the ruins of the Third Reich was the responsibility of the Allies.

Rovan has also been awarded the Legion dHonneur the Ordre National du Mérite the German Order of Merit with Star and the Bavarian Order of Merit. He died in a swimming accident in France."
Raymond Ruyer,"Raymond Ruyer was a French philosopher in the late 20th century. His work covered topics including the philosophy of biology the philosophy of informatics the philosophy of value and others. His most popular book is The Gnosis of Princeton in which he presents his own philosophical views under the pretence that he was representing the views of an imaginary group of American scientists. He developed an account of panpsychism which was a major influence on philosophers such as Adolf Portmann Gilbert Simondon Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.

Raymond Ruyer was born in 1902 in the village of Plainfaing department of Vosges France. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure passing the agrégation in philosophy with a thesis on the phenomenology of knowledge.

In 1937 he published his first book The Body and the Conscience.

During World War II Raymond Ruyer was a prisoner of war in Germany from 1940 to 1944. Upon his return he was appointed professor of philosophy at the Université de Nancy where he developed his theories of the philosophical implications of various branches of science mainly embryology biology and informatics. At the same time he continued his research on the theory of value which he had started before the war.

In the 1970s he was named corresponding member of the Institut de France. He was also offered a position at the Sorbonne which he declined preferring to continue working in Nancy where he was friends with many other scientists.

Being opposed to the existentialism and the leftist trends of the French post-war intelligentsia Ruyers work was better accepted in scientific circles abroad than in France. Publicist Raymond Aron advised him to try his luck at writing more popular works. His first such attempts did not raise public interest. Therefore based on the assumption that the French public was more fascinated by scientific developments in America Ruyer published the book The Gnosis of Princeton. He claimed to be in contact with a group of unidentified American gnostic philosophers who were trying to create a new religion identified as the Gnosis of Princeton where most of these imaginary scientists were active. Thereafter Raymond Ruyer presented his own gnostic ideas. The book was a success as many of its readers were not aware of the hoax for a long time. However his next publications did not raise interest in France and were better known in Canada and the United States.

Raymond Ruyer died in 1987 in Nancy. His last work Embryogenesis of the World and the Silent God was never published and is deposited as a manuscript at the University of Nancy."
Théodore Eugène César Ruyssen,"Théodore Eugène César Ruyssen was a French historian of philosophy and pacifist.

Ruyssen was born in Clisson Loire-Atlantique France. He was professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Bordeaux and president of lAssociation de la Paix par le Droit from 1896 to 1948.

After a study trip through Germany upon leaving school in 1889 Ruyssen took up the profession of teaching in 1896. He taught philosophy in various schools and graduated as Doctor of Philosophy with a thesis on IEvolution psychologique du Jugement in 1903. He lectured successively in the universities of Aix-en-Provence Dijon and finally Bordeaux where he occupied the chair of History of Philosophy.

Ruyssen was the President of the Association de la paix par le droit the most important peace organization in France which is widely known throughout the world through its official organ La Paix par le Droit and a member of the International Peace Bureau in Berne."
Han Ryner,"Jacques Élie Henri Ambroise Ner also known by the pseudonym Han Ryner was a French individualist anarchist philosopher and activist and a novelist. He wrote for publications such as LArt social LHumanité nouvelle LEnnemi du Peuple LIdée Libre de Lorulot; and LEn dehors and LUnique of fellow anarchist individualist Émile Armand. His thought is mainly influenced by stoicism and epicureanism.

He was born in Nemours Department of Orán French Algeria in a modest religious family. After the death of his mother he abandoned Catholicism associated himself with Freemasons and started having an interest in social ideas.

He published 2 novels in 18941895 and later started working as a journalist. After that he took a teaching position but struggled at having to fit into such a disciplined environment. He becomes a prolific literary writer.

In 1896 he adopted the pseudonym Han Ryner and started writing for such magazines as LArt social LHumanité nouvelle of Augustin Hamon LEnnemi du Peuple of Emile Janvion and LIdée Libre. From here he started collaborating in the important individualist anarchist magazine LEnDehors and LUnique of Émile Armand.

In 1900 he wrote the essay Le crime dobéir and in 1903 he wrote the essay Petit manuel individualiste in which he presented his anarchist individualist doctrine influenced by classic Greek stoicism in the works of Epictetus. By the 1920s his thought starts having an important influence in Spain within individualist anarchist circles especially through the translations of his work by Juan Elizalde. Han Ryner started writing in Spanish individualist journals such as Ética which already had an important influence of the thought of Ryner. The Brazilian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura took the task of making his philosophy and writing become known in the Portuguese-speaking world.

With the First World War approaching. Han Ryner embraced pacifist and anti-war positions and promotes conscience objection. In his anti-war activism he collaborates with Émile Armand.

He campaigned for the liberation of Eugène Dieudonné in 1913; for that of Émile Armand during the war; for the mutiny in the Black Sea and for the Italian-American anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti and for the Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno.

In May 1922 he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists.

A radical anticlerical he adhered to the World Committee against War and Fascism. He also opposed World War I on pacifist anti militaristic grounds. He was a rare case of an anarchist participating in the Félibrige.

The mature thought of Han Ryner is influenced by stoicism and epicureanism. From this first position he shows a tendency to fatalism towards the pains of life and those produced by society. He wrote in Mini-manual of individualism The Stoic Epictetus courageously bore poverty and slavery. He was perfectly happy in the situations most painful to ordinary men. He then emphasized subjective will as a power which individuals can resort to.

He defined individualism as the moral doctrine which relying on no dogma no tradition no external determination appeals only to the individual conscience. As models of individualists he names Socrates Epicurus Jesus and Epictetus and so these persons exemplify what he defines as harmonic individualism. For example he admires from Epicurus his temperance and that he showed that very little was needed to satisfy hunger and thirst to defend oneself against heat and the cold. And he liberated himself from all other needs that is almost all the desires and all the fears that enslave men.. From Jesus how He lived free and a wanderer foreign to any social ties. He was the enemy of priests external cults and in general all organizations. From these individualists as he defines them he distinguishes conquering and aggressive egoists who proclaim themselves to be individualists such as Stendhal and Nietzsche.

Han Ryner as well as fellow French individualist anarchist Émile Armand regarded individualist anarchism above all as a way of life. He regarded that the individualist act must be in accord with his ideas and he calls that virtue. For him disinterested virtue creates happiness which for him meant feeling oneself free of all outside servitudes and in perfect accord with oneself.

In relationships with others and things outside the individual he saw Every person is a goal an end and from this he saw that he can ask people for services that they will freely accord me either through benevolence or in exchange for other services. He defined society as a gathering of individuals for a common labor. From societys evils he advocated developing individual resistance towards building up indifference. He understood happiness as something that can only be reached through oneself and sees that Society has stolen from all in order to turn over to a few that great instrument of natural labor the earth. He rejected crowds as he sees them as the most brutal of natural forces.

He saw work as an evil worsened by society and that 1It arbitrarily dispenses a certain number of men from all work and places their part of the burden on other men. 2It employs many men at useless labors and social functions. 3It multiplies among all and particularly among the rich imaginary needs and it imposes on the poor the odious labor necessary for the satisfaction of these needs.

In line with Stirner he rejected sacrifices in the name of exterior Idols such as In certain countries the King or the Emperor in others some fraud called the Will of the People. Everywhere Order the Political party Religion the Fatherland the Race the Color. By color he meant race and he found deplorable that The White color especially ... has managed to unite in one cult the French Germans Russians and Italians and to obtain from these noble priests the bloody sacrifice of a great number of Chinese.... It is they who have made all of Africa a hell. It is they who destroyed the Indians of America and lynches Negroes."
Charles de Saint-Évremond,"Charles de Marguetel de Saint-Denis seigneur de Saint-Évremond was a French soldier hedonist essayist and literary critic. After 1661 he lived in exile mainly in England as a consequence of his attack on French policy at the time of the Peace of the Pyrenees . He is buried in Poets Corner Westminster. He wrote for his friends and did not intend his work to be published although a few of his pieces were leaked in his lifetime. The first full collection of his works was published in London in 1705 after his death.

He was born at Saint-Denis-le-Guast near Coutances the seat of his family in Normandy. He was a pupil of the Jesuits at the College de Clermont Paris; then a student at Caen. For a time he studied law in Paris at the College dHarcourt . He soon however took to arms and in 1629 went with Marshal Bassompierre to Italy. He served through a great part of the Thirty Years War distinguishing himself at the siege of Landrecies when he was made captain. During his campaigns he studied the works of Montaigne and the Spanish and Italian languages.

In 1639 he met Gassendi in Paris and became one of his disciples. He was present at the battles of Rocroi Nördlingen and at Lerida. For a time he was personally attached to Condé but offended him by a satirical remark and was deprived of his command in the princes guards in 1648. During the Fronde Saint-Évremond was a steady royalist. The Duke of Candale of whom Saint-Évremond has left a very severe portrait gave him a command in Guienne after he had reached the grade of maréchal de camp and he is said to have pocketed 50000 livres in less than three years from this office. He was one of the numerous victims involved in the fall of Fouquet in 1661. His letter to Marshal Créquy on the Treaty of the Pyrenees which is said to have been discovered by Colberts agents at the seizure of Fouquets papers seems a very inadequate cause for his disgrace.

Saint-Évremond fled to the Netherlands and to England where he was kindly received by Charles II and was pensioned. After James IIs flight to France Saint-Évremond was invited to return but he declined. Hortense Mancini the most attractive of Cardinal Mazarins group of attractive nieces came to England in 1670 and set up a salon for flirtation gambling and witty conversation and here Saint-Évremond was for many years at home. He died aged ninety on 29 September 1703 and was buried in Westminster Abbey where his monument is in Poets Corner close to that of Prior.

Saint-Évremond never authorised the printing of any of his works during his lifetime though Barbin in 1668 published an unauthorised collection but he empowered Pierre des Maizeaux to publish his works after his death and they were published in London and often reprinted. His masterpiece in irony is the so-called Conversation du maréchal dHocquincourt avec le père Canaye which has been frequently classed with the Lettres provinciales.

His Œuvres meslées edited from the manuscripts by Silvestre and Maizeaux were printed by Jacob Tonson with a notice by Maizeaux. His correspondence with Ninon de lEnclos whose fast friend he was was published in 1752; La Comédie des académistes written in 1643 was printed in 1650. Modern editions of his works are by Hippeau C. Giraud and a selection with a notice by M. de Lescure. Among his plays is one called Politick Would-be modelled on a character from Ben Jonsons Volpone."
Louis Claude de Saint-Martin,"Louis Claude de Saint-Martin was a French philosopher known as le philosophe inconnu the name under which his works were published; he was an influential of the mystic and human mind evolution and became the inspiration for the founding of the Martinist Order.

Léonce de Saint-Martin composer and organist is a distant relative of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin.

He was born at Amboise into a family from the lesser nobility of central France.

As his father wished he tried first law and then the army as a profession. While in the garrison at Bordeaux he came under the influence of Martinez de Pasqually usually called a Portuguese Jew who taught a species of mysticism drawn from cabbalistic sources and endeavoured to found thereon a secret cult with magical or theurgical rites. Around September 1768 Saint-Martin was introduced to the Elect Coëns. From 1768 until 1771 Saint-Martin worked at Bordeaux as secretary to Martinez de Pasqually.

In 1771 Saint-Martin left the army to become a preacher of mysticism. Same year he was living with Jean-Baptiste Willermoz at Lyon while writing his first book. His conversational powers made him welcome in Parisian salons; but his zeal led him to England where he made the acquaintance of William Law the English mystic and to Italy and Switzerland as well as to the chief towns of France. In February 1784 Saint-Martin joined Society of Harmony in Paris. In 1787 he met William Law on a trip to London. From 1788 until 1791 he resided at Strasbourg where he met Baron Karl Göran Silfverhjelm the nephew of Emanuel Swedenborg. At Strasbourg in 1788 he met Charlotte de Boecklin who introduced him to the writings of Jakob Böhme. In July 1790 he resigned from Rectified Scottish Rite and asked Jean-Baptiste Willermoz for his name to be removed from all Masonic registers. In 1792 Saint-Martin began corresponding with the Swiss theosopher Niklaus Anton Kirchberger von Liebisdorf.

A nobleman he was interned and his property was confiscated during the French Revolution. He was later freed by local officials who wanted him to become a school teacher. He was brought up a strict Catholic and always remained attached to the Church although his first work Of Errors and Truth was placed upon the Index. He died at Aulnay from October 13 to October 14 1803.

He was the first to translate the writings of Jakob Böhme from German into French. His later years were devoted almost entirely to the composition of his chief works and to the translation of Böhme. His published letters show that he was interested in spiritualism magnetic treatments magical evocation and the works of Emanuel Swedenborg.

His chief works are Lettre à un ami ou Considérations philosophiques et religieuses sur la révolution française Éclair sur lAssociation humaine LEsprit des choses ou Coup dœil philosophique sur la nature des êtres et sur lobjet de leur existence and Le Ministère de lHomme-Esprit. Other treatises appeared in his Œuvres posthumes . Saint-Martin regarded the French Revolution as a sermon in action if not indeed a miniature of the last judgment. His ideal society was a natural and spiritual theocracy in which God would raise up men of mark and endowment who would regard themselves strictly as divine commissioners to guide the people. All ecclesiastical organization was to disappear giving place to a purely spiritual Christianity based on the assertion of a faculty superior to the reason moral sense from which we derive knowledge of God. God exists as an eternal personality and the creation is an overflowing of the divine love which was unable to contain itself. The human soul the human intellect or spirit the spirit of the universe and the elements or matter are the four stages of this divine emanation man being the immediate reflection of God and nature in turn a reflection of man. Man however has fallen from his high estate and matter is one of the consequences of his fall. But divine love united to humanity in Christ will work the final regeneration.

Admirers of his works formed groups of Friends of St. Martin which later became known as Martinists. They were influential on the formation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn."
Henri de Saint-Simon,"Claude Henri de Rouvroy comte de Saint-Simon often referred to as Henri de Saint-Simon was a French political economic and socialist theorist and businessman whose thought had a substantial influence on politics economics sociology and the philosophy of science. He is a younger relative of the famous memoirist the Duc de Saint-Simon.

Saint-Simon created a political and economic ideology known as Saint-Simonianism that claimed that the needs of an industrial class which he also referred to as the working class needed to be recognized and fulfilled to have an effective society and an efficient economy. Unlike conceptions within industrializing societies of a working class being manual labourers alone Saint-Simons late-18th-century conception of this class included all people engaged in productive work that contributed to society such as businesspeople managers scientists and bankers along with manual labourers amongst others.

Saint-Simon said the primary threat to the needs of the industrial class was another class he referred to as the idling class that included able people who preferred to be parasitic and benefit from the work of others while seeking to avoid doing work. Saint-Simon stressed the need for recognition of the merit of the individual and the need for hierarchy of merit in society and in the economy such as society having hierarchical merit-based organizations of managers and scientists to be the decision-makers in government. Saint-Simon strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond ensuring no hindrances to productive work and reducing idleness in society regarding intervention beyond these as too intrusive.

Saint Simons conceptual recognition of broad socio-economic contribution and his Enlightenment valorization of scientific knowledge soon inspired and influenced utopian socialismliberal political theorist John Stuart Millanarchism through its founder Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who was inspired by Saint-Simons thought and Marxism with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels identifying Saint-Simon as an inspiration to their ideas and classifying him among the utopian socialists. Saint-Simons views also influenced 20th-century sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen including Veblens creation of institutional economics that has included prominent economists as adherents.

Henri de Saint-Simon was born in Paris as a French aristocrat. His grandfathers cousin had been the Duke of Saint-Simon. When he was a young man being of a restless disposition ... he went to America where he entered into American service and took part in the siege of Yorktown under General Washington.

From his youth Saint-Simon was highly ambitious. He ordered his valet to wake him every morning with Remember monsieur le comte that you have great things to do. Among his early schemes was one to connect the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans by a canal and another to construct a canal from Madrid to the sea.

During the American Revolution Saint-Simon joined the Americans and believed that their revolution signaled the beginning of a new era. He fought alongside the Marquis de Lafayette between 1779 and 1783 and was imprisoned by British forces. After his release he returned to France to study engineering and hydraulics at the Ecole de Mézières.

At the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789 Saint-Simon quickly endorsed the revolutionary ideals of liberty equality and fraternity. In the early years of the revolution Saint-Simon devoted himself to organizing a large industrial structure in order to found a scientific school of improvement. He needed to raise some funds to achieve his objectives which he did by land speculation. This was only possible in the first few years of the revolution because of the growing instability of the political situation in France which prevented him from continuing his financial activities and indeed put his life at risk. Saint-Simon and Talleyrand planned to profiteer during the Terror by buying the Cathedral of Notre-Dame stripping its roof of metal and selling the metal for scrap. Saint-Simon was imprisoned on suspicion of engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. He was released in 1794 at the end of the Terror. After he recovered his freedom Saint-Simon found himself immensely rich due to currency depreciation but his fortune was subsequently stolen by his business partner. Thenceforth he decided to devote himself to political studies and research. After the establishment of the Ecole Polytechnique in 1794 a school established to train young men in the arts of sciences and industry and funded by the state Saint-Simon became involved with the new school.

When he was nearly 40 he went through a varied course of study and experiment to enlarge and clarify his view of things. One of these experiments was an unhappy marriage in 1801 to Alexandrine-Sophie Goury de Champgrand undertaken so that he might have a literary salon. After a year the marriage was dissolved by mutual consent. The result of his experiments was that he found himself completely impoverished and lived in penury for the remainder of his life. The first of his numerous writings mostly scientific and political was Lettres dun habitant de Genève which appeared in 1802. In this first work he called for the creation of a religion of science with Isaac Newton as a saint. Around 1814 he wrote the essay On Reconstruction of the European Community and sent it to the Congress of Vienna. He proposed a European kingdom building on France and the United Kingdom.

In 1817 in a treatise entitled LIndustrie he began to propound his socialist views which he developed further in LOrganisateur a periodical on which Augustin Thierry and Auguste Comte collaborated. One of Saint-Simons major beliefs was that the world should be linked with canals.

LIndustrie caused a sensation but brought few converts. A couple of years later in his writing career Saint-Simon found himself ruined and was forced to work for a living. After a few attempts to recover his money from his former partner he received financial support from Diard a former employee and was able to publish in 1807 his second book Introduction aux travaux scientifiques du XIX siècle. Diard died in 1810 and Saint-Simon found himself poor again and this time also in poor health. He was sent to a sanatorium in 1813 but with financial help from relatives he had time to recover his health and gain some intellectual recognition in Europe. In February 1821 Du système industriel appeared and in 18231824 Catéchisme des industriels.

On March 9 1823 disappointed by the lack of results of his writing he attempted suicide in despair. Remarkably he shot himself in the head six times without succeeding losing his sight in one eye.

Finally very late in his career he did link up with a few ardent disciples. The last and most important expression of his views is Nouveau Christianisme which he left unfinished.

He was buried in Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris France.

In 1817 Saint-Simon published a manifesto called the Declaration of Principles in his work titled LIndustrie . The Declaration was about the principles of an ideology called industrialism that called for the creation of an industrial society led by people within what he defined as the industrial class. The industrial class also referred to as the working class was defined as including all people engaged in productive work that contributed to society emphasizing scientists and industrialists but including engineers businesspeople managers bankers manual workers and others.

Saint-Simon said the primary threat to the needs of the industrial class was another class he referred to as the idling class that included able people who preferred to be parasitic and benefit from the work of others while seeking to avoid doing work. He saw the origins of this parasitic activity by idlers in what he regarded as the natural laziness of humanity. He believed the principal economic roles of government were to ensure that productive activity in the economy is unhindered and to reduce idleness in society.

In the Declaration Saint-Simon strongly criticized any expansion of government intervention into the economy beyond these two principal economic roles saying that when the government goes beyond these roles it becomes a tyrannical enemy of industry and that the industrial economy will decline as a consequence of such excessive government intervention. Saint-Simon stressed the need for recognition of the merit of the individual and the need for hierarchy of merit in society and in the economy such as society having hierarchical merit-based organizations of managers and scientists to be the decision-makers in government. His views were radical for his time. He built on Enlightenment ideas which challenged church doctrine and the older regime with the idea of progress from industry and science

Heavily influenced by the absence of social privilege he saw in the early United States Saint-Simon renounced his aristocratic title and came to favor a form of meritocracy becoming convinced that science was the key to progress and that it would be possible to develop a society based on objective scientific principles. He claimed that feudal society in France and elsewhere needed to be dissolved and transformed into an industrial society. As such he invented the conception of the industrial society.

Saint-Simons economic views and ideas were influenced by Adam Smith whom Saint-Simon deeply admired and referred to him in praise as the immortal Adam Smith. He shared with Smith the belief that taxes needed to be much reduced from what they were then in order to have a more just industrial system. Saint-Simon desired the minimization of government intervention into the economy to prevent disruption of productive work. He emphasized more emphatically than Smith that state administration of the economy was generally parasitic and hostile to the needs of production. Like Adam Smith Saint-Simons model of society emulated the scientific methods of astronomy and said The astronomers only accepted those facts which were verified by observation; they chose the system which linked them best and since that time they have never led science astray..

Saint-Simon reviewed the French Revolution and regarded it as an upheaval driven by economic change and class conflict. In his analysis he believed that the solution to the problems that led to the French Revolution would be the creation of an industrial society where hierarchy of merit and respect for productive work would be the basis of society while ranks of hereditary and military hierarchy would lessen in importance in society because they were not capable to lead a productive society.

Karl Marx identified Saint-Simon as being among whom he called the utopian socialists though historian Alan Ryan regards certain followers of Saint-Simon rather than Saint-Simon himself as being responsible for the rise of utopian socialism that based itself upon Saint-Simons ideas. Ryan also distinguishes between Saint-Simons conceptions and Marxisms as Saint-Simon did not promote independent working-class organization and leadership as a solution to capitalist societal problems nor did he adhere to the Marxist definition of the working class as excluded by fundamental private property law from control over the means of production. Unlike Marx Saint-Simon did not regard class relations vis the means of production to be an engine of socio-economic dynamics but rather the form of management. Furthermore Saint-Simon was not critical of capitalists as exclusive owners collaborators controllers and decision-makers. Rather he regarded capitalists as an important component of the industrial class. Ryan further suggests that by the 1950s it was clear that Saint-Simon had presaged the modern understanding of industrial society.

In opposition to the feudal and military systemthe former aspect of which had been strengthened by the restorationhe advocated a form of technocratic socialism an arrangement whereby industrial chiefs should control society similar to Plato philosopher kings. In place of the medieval church spiritual direction of society should fall to the men of science. Men who are fitted to organize society for productive labour are entitled to rule it. The conflict between labour and capital emphasized by later socialism is not present in Saint-Simons work but it is assumed that the industrial chiefs to whom the control of production is to fall shall rule in the interest of society. Later on the cause of the poor receives greater attention until in his greatest work Nouveau Christianisme it takes on the form of a religion. This development of his ideas occasioned his final quarrel with Comte.

Prior to the publication of the Nouveau Christianisme Saint-Simon had not concerned himself with theology. In this work he starts from a belief in God and his object in the treatise is to reduce Christianity to its simple and essential elements. He does this by clearing it of the dogmas and other excrescences and defects that he says gathered round the Catholic and Protestant forms of it. He propounds as the comprehensive formula of the new Christianity this precept The whole of society ought to strive towards the amelioration of the moral and physical existence of the poorest class; society ought to organize itself in the way best adapted for attaining this end. This principle became the watchword of the entire Saint-Simon school of thought.

During his lifetime the views of Saint-Simon had very little influence; he left only a few devoted disciples who continued to advocate the doctrines of their master whom they revered as a prophet. The most acclaimed disciple of Saint-Simon was Auguste Comte. Others included Olinde Rodrigues the favoured disciple of Saint-Simon and Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin who together had received Saint-Simons last instructions. Their first step was to establish a journal Le Producteur but it was discontinued in 1826. The sect had begun to grow and before the end of 1828 had meetings not only in Paris but in many provincial towns.

An important departure was made in 1828 by Amand Bazard who gave a complete exposition of the Saint-Simonian faith in a long course of lectures in Paris which was well attended. His Exposition de la doctrine de St Simon which is by far the best account of it won more adherents. The second volume was chiefly by Enfantin who along with Bazard stood at the head of the society but who was superior in philosophical acumen and was prone to push his deductions to extremities. The revolution of July brought a new freedom to the socialist reformers. A proclamation was issued demanding community of goods abolition of the right of inheritance and enfranchisement of women.

Early next year the school obtained possession of Le Globe through Pierre Leroux who had joined the school. The school now counted among its number some of the ablest and most promising young men in France many of the pupils of the École Polytechnique having caught its enthusiasm. The members formed themselves into an association arranged in three grades and constituting a society or family which lived out of a common purse in the Rue Monsigny. Before long dissensions began to arise in the sect. Bazard a man of stolid temperament could no longer work in harmony with Enfantin who desired to establish an arrogant and fantastic sacerdotalism with lax notions as to marriage and the relations between the sexes. In the name of progress Enfantin announced that the gulf between the sexes was too wide and this social inequality would impede rapid growth of society. Enfantin called for the abolition of prostitution and for the ability for women to divorce and obtain legal rights. This was considered radical for the time.

After a time Bazard seceded and many of the strongest supporters of the school followed his example. A series of extravagant entertainments given by the society during the winter of 1832 reduced its financial resources and greatly discredited it in character. They moved to Ménilmontant to a property of Enfantin where they lived in a communalistic society distinguished by a peculiar dress. Although the monks of Enfantins school were required to be celibate rumors were spread that they engaged in orgies. Shortly after the chiefs were tried and condemned for proceedings prejudicial to the social order and the sect was entirely broken up in 1832. Many of its members became famous as engineers economists and men of business. Enfantin would go on to organize an expedition of the disciples to Constantinople and then to Egypt where he influenced the creation of the Suez Canal.

French feminist and socialist writer Flora Tristan claimed that Mary Wollstonecraft author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman anticipated Saint-Simons ideas by a generation.

In Fyodor Dostoyevskys novel The Possessed Saint-Simonist and Fourierist are used as derogatory insults of others by many of the politically active characters.

According to Fr. Cyril Martindale Robert Hugh Benson got the idea of his dystopian science fiction novel about the Antichrist published in 1908 as Lord of the World from his friend and literary mentor Frederick Rolfe who also introduced Monsignor Benson to the writings of Saint-Simon. According to Fr.

Philippe-Joseph Salazar,"Philippe-Joseph Salazar translated in four languages .

Salazars advisor at Ecole Normale Supérieure was Louis Althusser. While at ENS he joined the Conférence Olivaint an exclusive club dedicated to training future leaders in the Catholic and liberal tradition of public oratory and completed a voluntary internship at the cultural affairs section of Paris City Hall when President Chirac was mayor.

Salazar would later pursue graduate studies in metaphysics with Emmanuel Levinas in semiotics with Roland Barthes and in political theory with Maurice Duverger. Lacanian psychoanalyst and film theorist Anna Guédy of École Freudienne de Paris further influenced his academic career which led to a collaboration to critical theory journal La Cause Freudienne edited by Jacques Lacan and Jacques-Alain Miller. Early friendships with French avant-garde actor Serge Merlin and professor of declamation Pierre Spivakoff deepened his understanding of voice. He began contributing extensive articles on voice opera and psycho-analysis to leading journal Avant-Scène Opera . On Maria Callas death French far-left daily Libération asked Salazar to write her obituary.

At the prompting of both his philosophy advisor Louis Althusser and French sociologist Georges Balandier Salazar travelled to apartheid South Africa in 1978 to undertake field-research on racial rhetoric which led to a first doctoral dissertation in social and cultural anthropology at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The examination copy of his dissertation was blocked by the South African Security Police but sneaked out of the Apartheid state via diplomatic pouch see preface to his bookAn African Athens and eventually published as LIntrigue Raciale Essai de Critique Anthropologique. He has since retained a strong interest in anthropology.

After returning to Paris Salazar served for a while as Arts and Letters editor of controversial psycho-analytical magazine Spirales edited by Armando Verdiglione. He published lengthy interviews with William Styron and painter Elizabeth Franzheim and he resumed writing on opera in Avant-Scène Opera as well as Opera International and Lyrica . He wrote also in French conservative-liberal monthly Commentaire. His first book Idéologies de lopéra is considered a breakthrough in the field of sociology and anthropology of opera. Salazar dedicated the book to his mentor Germaine Lubin. In 1981 he published his opera Icare in Islamic poet and psychoanalyst Michel Orcels literary journal LAlphée and contributed to Philippe Sollerss famed avant-garde journal LInfini at the prompting of novelist Dominique Rolin. He has since retained an interest in opera as a social form of knowledge .

This intersectional interest in anthropology philosophy and political theory led him to engage with a newly re-emerging field rhetoric.

In the 1980s Salazars senior doctorate advisor and Balzan Prize laureate Marc Fumaroli had reshaped the field of rhetoric studies in regard of French literary and political culture . Since the late 1980s Fumarolis work in Paris in Italy and at the University of Chicago has been decisive in the reshaping of cultural studies from a non if not anti structuralism and deconstruction approach. Salazars senior dissertation concerned itself with oral culture in the French classical age and it remains to this day a reference work on the topic as Le Culte de la Voix au 17e Siècle. The book is dedicated to the memory of Roland Barthes and Georges Dumézil who had both encouraged him to make voice his very own scholarly project. In 1993 Salazar convened at Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle a prestigious locale for cutting edge research a colloquium to salute Fumarolis pioneering work in rhetoric. During this classical phase Salazar published or edited key documents of French cultural tradition such as Charles Alphonse du Fresnoys seminal De Arte Graphica Bishop Jacques Amyots royal lectures on oratory for King Henri III royal preceptor and theologian Pierre Daniel Huets Memoirs and skeptical philosopher François de La Mothe Le Vayer the Sun-Kings teacher. Recognized as a prominent 17th century studies scholar Salazar was appointed to a Chair at Centre dEtudes de la Renaissance at François Rabelais University Tours France in 1999. In 2000 Salazar relinquished the Tours Chair to devote his research to rhetoric as a technology of power in modern public affairs. He took up an appointment as Distinguished Chair in Rhetoric and Humane Letters at the University of Cape Town South Africa. At that time he was elected to a sought after 6-year Directorship in Rhetoric and Democracy at Jacques Derridas Foundation Collège international de philosophie in Paris extending the work done at the Centre for Rhetoric Studies Cape Town he founded while Dean of Arts in 1994.

The Centre for Rhetoric Studies at the University of Cape Town was founded with a view to study the importance of rhetoric for peaceful democracy . The projects based at the Centre in Cape Town mirrored Salazars own research chair in Paris. Both focused on rhetoric as a foundation for public life and in post-totalitarian democracy in particular. Influential magazine Sciences Humaines praised Salazars book Hyperpolitique for resetting rhetoric at the centre of human sciences enquiry

If Salazars work is not unique in regard of a concern with rhetorical forms among contemporary French philosophers its originality lies in its focus rhetorical technologies of power in democracy the question of reconciliation and the practices of opinion-based political evil.. His work parallels that of fellow philosopher François Jullien on Chinese manipulation and of philologist and Heideggerian philosopher Barbara Cassin on Sophistry in Ancient Greece. Historian of the public sphere Emmanuel Lemieux called him an atypical philosopher.

Seminal works have marked Salazars reshaping of rhetoric as the study of forms of power in contemporary democracies Truth in PoliticsAmnistier lApartheid Vérité Réconciliation Réparation a collaborative book with Paul Ricoeur and Jacques Derrida credited for having introduced in French political thought the concept of ubuntu . Salazars works also include edited volumes on Democratic Rhetoric and the Duty of Deliberation and The Rhetorical Shape of International Conflicts. In addition to his rhetorical analysis of declarations of war and a study of Nobel Prize rhetoric in his edited volume on French rhetoric and philosophy today . His work on the rhetorical foundation of politics extends beyond Europe and Africa with a publication on Les Slaves and a book Mahomet a study of rhetorical common places regarding the Prophet of Islam. His publications led to a sustained conversation and broadcast on forgiveness and secularism with Arab poet and philosopher Abdelwahab Meddeb in 2006. and broadcast Cultures DIslam 05272006.

With Hyperpolitique Salazar opened a new area of investigation rhetoric studies as philosophy of power. Le Nouvel Economiste carried a laudatory critique of the book and of its relevance for leadership studies. More recent publications Paroles de Leaders Décrypter le Discours des Puissants in August 2011 and LArt de séduire lélecteur indécis have placed him at the forefront of the field. Premier management quarterly LExpansion Management Review placed Paroles de Leaders on its Books To Read list . Salazar is currently engaging with covert forms of power intelligence and surveillance studies with a lead essay in Italian philosophy journal Lo Sguardo an edited volume for Swiss transnational journal and think tank Cosmopolis following a collaborative volume on SurveillanceRhetoric .

Salazars work has secured him a global influence in his field. He has addressed the Observatoire de la Transition démocratique et Forum de la Citoyenneté in Rabat Morocco ahead of the Moroccan Equite et Réconciliation National Commission . He has held the Annual Seminar in Peace and Conflict Resolution at Concordia University in Montreal Canada. Among his signature public lectures the Annual Lecture in Law and Literature at John Jay College of Criminal Justice CUNY New York; the 18th Kenneth Burke Annual Lecture at the Center for Democratic Deliberation at Penn State in which he outlined his thinking on the rhetorical foundation of political philosophy and addressed a colloquium on the U.S. presidency and its rhetoric of virtue ; the Buenos Aires Forum of Rhetoric ; the Balkan Summer University for young philosophers on rhetorical technologies of domination in democratic societies; in Brussels the ULBs annual public lecture on democracy and debate; in 2011 at the University of Nanking and at Yangzhou University; in 2017 at the Fondazione MAST in Bologna Italy; and at the Berlin literature festival Haus für Poesie. Salazar has extended the scope of rhetorical critique to marxism in avant-garde journals Consecutio Temporum and Transeuropéennes.

As a public intellectual Salazar has appeared on France-Culture French C-Span Public-Senat. and notably TV5 Monde. He has written for Le Figaro LExpress Le Point Le Nouvel Observateur Atlantico. Causeur and Valeurs Actuelles. He appears regularly on the Rachel Marsden showon Sputnik radio in French. He contributes to the publications of the French Centre for Intelligence Studies and a Defense and Security studies site. In addition to his regular chronicles for online culture newsmagazine Les Influences as Le rhéteur cosmopolite and Comment raisonnent-ils and blogs at Yale Books Unbound.

His award-winning book Paroles armées has received international praise. It is a full-scale analysis of the Islamic States propaganda and rhetorical strategies of influence . On the occasion of the Darmstadt premiere of Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelineks play Wut on the January 2015 Paris terror attack against Charlie Hebdo by militants of the Islamic State excerpts of Salazars Die Sprache des Terrors were reprinted to introduce the play. The French book received the coveted prix Bristol des Lumières a day before the November 2015 Paris Bataclan massacre by Islamic States militants.

His most recent book in French is a full scale study of key figures of the international white supremacywhite nationalism what he calls the white awakening in his critical legal study essay on mass murderer Dylann Roof.

Georges-Elia Sarfati,"Georges-Elia Sarfati is a philosopher linguist poet and an existentialist psychoanalyst author of written works in the domains of ethics Jewish thought social criticism and discourse analysis. He has translated Viktor E. Frankl. He is the grand-nephew of the sociologist Gaston Bouthoul.

G.-E. Sarfati is a University professor member of the teaching staff of the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies and educational director of the University Center Sigmund Freud in Paris. In 1989 he presented a doctorate thesis under the supervision of Oswald Ducrot at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences . In 1996 he was appointed as a research supervisor at the University Sorbonne-Paris IV. He is also a graduate of the Salomon Schechter Institute he has a doctorate in Hebrew and Jewish Studies at the University of Strasbourg.

Aware of the persistence of the jewish question in Europe following Leon Poliakov and Jean-Pierre Faye he is as well as P.-A. Taguieff and S. Trigano one of the first intellectual to diagnose the emergence of new anti-Semitism through its cultural ideological and political variations. The contemporary expression of judeophobia doesnt solely stem from the recycling of the conspiracy theory it builds upon its establishment in the history of mentalities and speeches. Its platitudes are defining a negative judeocentrism related to the spread of the post-modern ideology characterized by the obviousness of the conformists. The anti-zionist rhetoric genuinely a part of popular culture especially in France is one of the main characteristics of contemporary pseudo-progressivism.

The denunciation of that state of affairs doubles up as a critic of post-genocidal ideology whereby memory of the Shoah serves as an identity to the survivors of the big slaughter isolating their dignity as victims under the express condition that they demonstrate no sympathy towards Israel. Ignorance of Jewish culture is based on three parameters the biased teaching of Jewish history at school partial and biased information processing and exclusive media focus on the conflict in the Middle East.

The history of psychological warfare based upon the examination of rhetorical disinformation propaganda rests in principle on the inversion of values and the strategic designation of a scapegoat. After two millennia of cultural development it is not surprising that Jewish symbolism has been subject to all types of distortions. The first lessons of the Jewish Bible have been subverted into their opposite through ideological discourse. This can be seen from the infamous stereotypes that prevailed in the Middle Ages to modern accusations of communitarianism racism and cruelty.

It follows that the globalization of the market doubles as a globalization of this ignorance. In this hazardous context it is imperative to revive a tradition of scholarship and intellectual clarity one which specifically rehabilitates textual sources and values of Jewish humanism restoring a historical heritage broken by a culture of slogan. This perspective includes the exhumation and comments of the scholarly tradition that preceded and accompanied the development of Western civilization especially the teachings of the Musar relayed through the rabbinical chain of transmission the ancient discipline of spiritual exercises.

The analysis of this social pathology brings up questions regarding language mechanisms in the production of opinion and the way in which it dominates public space.

This critical point of view contributes to the renewal of social philosophy showing that in a world saturated by media communication discourse experiences organize the social representations highly and determine new forms of alienation and reification. G.-E. Sarfati coined the neologism doxopathia that in a context of cultural destruction the enslavement and dependency phenomenon of the masses is a direct result of the automation of the dominant opinion. Extending Antonio Gramscis thinking about the dissemination of standards and knowledge through society he developed a general theory of the common understanding by creating the methodological tools of a counter-discourse.

But the semantics and anthropological questions surrounding the establishment of a meaning find their other honored expression in the context ofexistential analysis and logotherapy where one must give meaning to ones own life confronted with the requisites of its own existence by splitting up all determinations that affect the project with ones current degree of autonomy. From this point of view the subjective search for meaning remains inseparable from the ethical and political struggle for freedom from the snares of conformity and totalitarianism.

In light of foregoing aspects of research the work of poetic language is understood as shimmering memories of a subject through the evocation of the crux of the matter at hand. The exploration of the signs of presence to the world according to the metamorphoses of history is a defense of the singularity that confronts the new idols of the tribe that is the impersonal rule of hearsay and production of an objectified language."
Jean-Paul Sartre,"Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre was a French philosopher playwright novelist screenwriter political activist biographer and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. His work has also influenced sociology critical theory post-colonial theory and literary studies and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer Simone de Beauvoir. Together Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of their upbringings which they considered bourgeois in both lifestyles and thought. The conflict between oppressive spiritually destructive conformity and an authentic way of being became the dominant theme of Sartres early work a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work Being and Nothingness . Sartres introduction to his philosophy is his work Existentialism Is a Humanism originally presented as a lecture.

He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it saying that he always declined official honors and that a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution.

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in Paris as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre an officer of the French Navy and Anne-Marie . His mother was of Alsatian origin and the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer whose father Louis Théophile was the younger brother of Anne-Maries father.When Sartre was two years old his father died of an illness which he most likely contracted in Indochina. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents house in Meudon where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to classical literature at a very early age. When he was twelve Sartres mother remarried and the family moved to La Rochelle where he was frequently bullied in part due to the wandering of his blind right eye .

As a teenager in the 1920s Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading Henri Bergsons essay Time and Free Will An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness. He attended the Cours Hattemer a private school in Paris. He studied and earned certificates in psychology history of philosophy logic general philosophy ethics and sociology and physics as well as his diplôme détudes supérieures was supervised by Henri Delacroix. It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong sometimes fractious friendship with Raymond Aron. Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartres philosophical development was his weekly attendance at Alexandre Kojèves seminars which continued for a number of years.

From his first years in the École normale Sartre was one of its fiercest pranksters. In 1927 his antimilitarist satirical cartoon in the revue of the school coauthored with Georges Canguilhem particularly upset the director Gustave Lanson. In the same year with his comrades Nizan Larroutis Baillou and Herland he organized a media prank following Charles Lindberghs successful New York CityParis flight; Sartre Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers including Le Petit Parisien announced the event on 25 May. Thousands including journalists and curious spectators showed up unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh look-alike. The publics resultant outcry forced Lanson to resign.

In 1929 at the École normale he met Simone de Beauvoir who studied at the Sorbonne and later went on to become a noted philosopher writer and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions initiating a romantic relationship though they were not monogamous. The first time Sartre took the agrégation he failed. He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir although Sartre was eventually awarded first place with Beauvoir second.

From 1931 until 1945 Sartre taught at various lycées of Le Havre 19311936 Laon and finally Paris .

In 1932 Sartre read Voyage au bout de la nuit by Louis-Ferdinand Céline a book that had a remarkable influence on him.

In 193334 he succeeded Raymond Aron at the Institut français dAllemagne in Berlin where he studied Edmund Husserls phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read Emmanuel Levinass Théorie de lintuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl .

The neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers including Sartre to discover Hegels Phenomenology of Spirit.

In 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army where he served as a meteorologist. He was captured by German troops in 1940 in Padoux and he spent nine months as a prisoner of warin Nancy and finally in Stalag XII-D Trier where he wrote his first theatrical piece Barionà fils du tonnerre a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read Martin Heideggers Sein und Zeit later to become a major influence on his own essay on phenomenological ontology. Because of poor health Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist. Given civilian status he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris and settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position previously held by a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by Vichy law at Lycée Condorcet in Paris.

After coming back to Paris in May 1941 he participated in the founding of the underground group Socialisme et Liberté with other writers Simone de Beauvoir Maurice Merleau-Ponty Jean-Toussaint Desanti Dominique Desanti Jean Kanapa and École Normale students. In spring of 1941 Sartre suggested with cheerful ferocity at a meeting that the Socialisme et Liberté assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel Déat but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades. The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France General Otto von Stülpnagel and the popular slogan always was Death to Laval rather than Death to Hitler. In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of André Gide and André Malraux. However both Gide and Malraux were undecided and this may have been the cause of Sartres disappointment and discouragement. Socialisme et liberté soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote Being and Nothingness The Flies and No Exit none of which were censored by the Germans and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay Paris under the Occupation Sartre wrote that the correct behaviour of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation accepting what was unnatural as natural

The Germans did not stride revolver in hand through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark We could not be natural. French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation. Ousby wrote But in however humble a fashion everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartres worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life. Sartre wrote the very correctness of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the correct behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity and the very act of simply trying to live ones day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the New Order in Europe which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.

Throughout the occupation it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany. Sartre wrote about the languid existence of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed writing Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life. Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvoir living in Anjou. The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots and despite being hungry Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable saying it had more maggots in it than meat. Sartre also remarked that conversations at the Café de Flore between intellectuals had changed as the fear that one of them might be a mouche or a writer of the corbeau meant that no one really said what they meant anymore imposing self-censorship. Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940 the Abwehr alone had already recruited 32000 French people to work as mouches while by 1942 the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1500 lettersper day sent by the corbeaux.

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a sham resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany looking like the old Paris but hollowed out as what had made Paris special was gone. Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew which led Sartre to remark that Paris was peopled by the absent. Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing

One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell but no-one would answer it. If the concierge forced the door you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words .

Sartre wrote the feldgrau uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called a pale dull green unobtrusive strain which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians. Under the occupation the French often called the Germans les autres which inspired Sartres aphorism in his play Huis clos of lenfer cest les Autres . Sartre intended the line lenfer cest les Autres at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.

Sartre was a very active contributor to Combat a newspaper created during the clandestine period by Albert Camus a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951 with the publication of Camuss The Rebel. Sartre wrote extensively post-war about neglected minority groups namely French Jews and black people. In 1946 he published Anti-Semite and Jew after having published the first part of the essay Portrait de lantisémite the year before in Les Temps modernes No. 3. In the essay in the course of explaining the etiology of hate he attacks antisemitism in France during a time when the Jews who came back from concentration camps were quickly abandoned. In 1947 Sartre published several articles concerning the condition of African Americans in the United Statesspecifically the racism and discrimination against them in the countryin his second Situations collection. Then in 1948 for the introduction of Léopold Sédar Senghors lAnthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache he wrote Black Orpheus a critique of colonialism and racism in light of the philosophy Sartre developed in Being and Nothingness. Later while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant the French philosopher and resistant Vladimir Jankelevitch criticized Sartres lack of political commitment during the German occupation and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945 after the war ended Sartre moved to an apartment on the rue Bonaparte where he was to produce most of his subsequent work and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political review Les Temps modernes in part to popularize his thought. He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels Les Chemins de la Liberté .

The first period of Sartres career defined in large part by Being and Nothingness gave way to a second periodwhen the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocsof highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the Resistance after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action and recalled that the résistants were a band of brothers who had enjoyed real freedom in a way that did not exist before nor after the war. Sartre was merciless in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach from being executed. His 1948 play Les mains sales in particular explored the problem of being a politically engaged intellectual. He embraced Marxism but did not join the Communist Party. For a time in the late 1940s Sartre described French nationalism as provincial and in a 1949 essay called for a United States of Europe. In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal Politique étrangère Sartre wrote

If we want French civilization to survive it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy in France in Benelux in Sweden in Norway in Germany in Greece in Austria everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europes cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union but also its political and economic autonomy with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs not a third bloc but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.

About the Korean War Sartre wrote I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans. In July 1950 Sartre wrote in Les Temps Modernes about his and de Beauvoirs attitude to the Soviet Union

As we were neither members of the party nor its avowed sympathizers it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a revolutionary state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of bourgeois states were due to their innate shortcomings. The Swiss journalist François Bondy wrote that based on a reading of Sartres numerous essays speeches and interviews a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges may be criticized but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose its struggle and its road to power deeming Sartres position to be existentialist.

Sartre believed at this time in the moral superiority of the Eastern Bloc Arguing that this belief was necessary to keep hope alive and opposed any criticism of Soviet Union to the extent that Maurice Merleau-Ponty called him an ultra-Bolshevik. Sartres expression workers of Billancourt must not be deprived of their hopes became a catchphrase meaning communist activists should not tell the whole truth to the workers in order to avoid decline in their revolutionary enthusiasm.

In 1954 just after Stalins death Sartre visited the Soviet Union which he stated he found a complete freedom of criticism while condemning the United States for sinking into prefascism. Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers Union still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books. Sartres comments on Hungarian revolution of 1956 are quite representative to his frequently contradictory and changing views. On one hand Sartre saw in Hungary a true reunification between intellectuals and workers only to criticize it for losing socialist base. He condemned the Soviet invasion of Hungary in November 1956.

In 1964 Sartre attacked Khrushchevs Secret Speech which condemned the Stalinist repressions and purges. Sartre argued that the masses were not ready to receive the truth.

In 1973 he argued that revolutionary authority always needs to get rid of some people that threaten it and their death is the only way. A number of people starting from Frank Gibney in 1961 classified Sartre as a useful idiot due to his uncritical position.

Sartre came to admire the Polish leader Władysław Gomułka a man who favored a Polish road to socialism and wanted more independence for Poland but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue. Sartres newspaper Les Temps Modernes devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka praising him for his reforms. Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sartes ultra Bolshevism as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader Mao Zedong as the man who led the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.

As an anti-colonialist Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the FLN in the Algerian War and was one of the signatories of the Manifeste des 121. Consequently Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary Organisation armée secrète escaping two bomb attacks in the early 60s. He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the Algerian War of Independence. He opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and along with Bertrand Russell and others organized a tribunal intended to expose U.S. war crimes which became known as the Russell Tribunal in 1967.

His work after Stalins death the Critique de la raison dialectique appeared in 1960 . In the Critique Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marxs notion of class as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartres emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s Louis Althusser who claimed that the ideas of the young Marx were decisively superseded by the scientific system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx and influenced by Frantz Fanon stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World the real damned of the earth who would carry out the revolution. A major theme of Sartes political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the Americanization of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.

Sartre went to Cuba in the 1960s to meet Fidel Castro and spoke with Ernesto Che Guevara. After Guevaras death Sartre would declare him to be not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age and the eras most perfect man. Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that he lived his words spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel. However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castros government which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews and said In Cuba there are no Jews but there are homosexuals.

During a collective hunger strike in 1974 Sartre visited Red Army Faction member Andreas Baader in Stammheim Prison and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.

Towards the end of his life Sartre began to describe himself as a special kind of anarchist.

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life Les Mots . The book is an ironic counterblast to Marcel Proust whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of André Gide . Literature Sartre concluded functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964 Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize and remains one of only two laureates to do so. According to Lars Gyllensten in the book Minnen bara minnen published in 2000 Sartre himself or someone close to him got in touch with the Swedish Academy in 1975 with a request for the prize money but was refused. In 1945 he had refused the Légion dhonneur. The Nobel prize was announced on 22 October 1964; on 14 October Sartre had written a letter to the Nobel Institute asking to be removed from the list of nominees and warning that he would not accept the prize if awarded but the letter went unread; on 23 October Le Figaro published a statement by Sartre explaining his refusal. He said he did not wish to be transformed by such an award and did not want to take sides in an East vs. West cultural struggle by accepting an award from a prominent Western cultural institution. Nevertheless he was that years prizewinner. After being awarded the prize he tried to escape the media by hiding in the house of Simones sister Hélène de Beauvoir in Goxwiller Alsace.

Though his name was then a household word Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions actively committed to causes until the end of his life such as the May 1968 strikes in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. President Charles de Gaulle intervened and pardoned him commenting that you dont arrest Voltaire.

In 1975 when asked how he would like to be remembered Sartre replied

I would like No Exit and The Devil and the Good Lord and then my two philosophical works more particularly the second one Critique of Dialectical Reason. Then my essay on Genet Saint Genet. ... If these are remembered that would be quite an achievement and I dont ask for more. As a man if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived ... how I lived in it in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.

Sartres physical condition deteriorated partially because of the merciless pace of work he put himself through during the writing of the Critique and a massive analytical biography of Gustave Flaubert both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious chain smoker which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.

Pierre Victor who spent much of his time with the dying Sartre and interviewed him on several of his views. According to Victor Sartre had a drastic change of mind about the existence of god and started gravitating toward Messianic Judaism. This is Sartres before-death profession according to Pierre Victor I do not feel that I am the product of chance a speck of dust in the universe but someone who was expected prepared prefigured. In short a being whom only a Creator could put here; and this idea of a creating hand refers to god. Simone de Beauvoir later revealed her anger at his change of mind by stating How should one explain this senile act of a turncoat All my friends all the Sartreans and the editorial team of Les Temps Modernes supported me in my consternation.

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from edema of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at Père-Lachaise Cemetery between his mother and stepfather so it was arranged that he be buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. At his funeral on Saturday 19 April 50000 Parisians descended onto boulevard du Montparnasse to accompany Sartres cortege. The funeral started at the hospital at 200 p.m. then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement past all Sartres haunts and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet. Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate. Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery to the right of the cemetery gate.

Sartres primary idea is that people as humans are condemned to be free. This may seem paradoxical because condemnation is normally an external judgment which constitutes the conclusion of a judgment. Here it is not the human who has chosen to be like this. There is a contingency of human existence. It is a condemnation of their being. Their being is not determined so it is up to everyone to create their own existence for which they are then responsible. They cannot not be free there is a form of necessity for freedom which can never be given up.This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator and is illustrated using the example of the paper cutter. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus existence precedes essence. This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain ones own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. We are left alone without excuse. We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us.

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience death consciousness so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience not knowledge. Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world. In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free individual existence. We can oppose authenticity to an inauthentic way of being. Authenticity consists in experiencing the indeterminate character of existence in anguish. It is also to know how to face it by giving meaning to our actions and by recognizing ourselves as the author of this meaning. On the other hand an inauthentic way of being consists in running away in lying to oneself in order to escape this anguish and the responsibility for ones own existence.

While Sartre had been influenced by Heidegger the publication of Being and Nothingness did mark a split in their perspectives with Heidegger remarking in Letter on Humanism

Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking existentia and essentia according to their metaphysical meaning which from Platos time on has said that essentia precedes existentia. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it he stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being.

Herbert Marcuse also had issues with Sartres opposition to metaphysics in Being and Nothingness and suggested the work projected anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself 

As a junior lecturer at the Lycée du Havre in 1938 Sartre wrote the novel La Nausée which serves in some ways as a manifesto of existentialism and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the German phenomenological movement he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose this novel concerns a dejected researcher in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.

He also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology explained by Franz Adler in this way Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.

This indifference of things in themselves has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the nausea referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive even horrible tastespecifically his freedom. The book takes the term from Friedrich Nietzsches Thus Spoke Zarathustra where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.

The novel also acts as a realization of some of Immanuel Kants fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will as a way to show the worlds indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless and the practical application of Kants ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.

Also important is Sartres analysis of psychological concepts including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions to desires as well as to perceptions. When an external object is perceived consciousness is also conscious of itself even if consciousness is not its own object it is a non-positional consciousness of itself. However his critique of psychoanalysis particularly of Freud has faced some counter-critique. Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin argued that Sartres attempt to show that Sigmund Freuds theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.

While the broad focus of Sartres life revolved around the notion of human freedom he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War around 19441945. Before World War II he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays read novels and dined 

Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu chief protagonist in The Age of Reason which was completed during Sartres first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute rationalist analyzing every situation and functioning entirely on reason he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result Mathieu could recognize no allegiance except to Mathieus commitment was only to himself never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then for these reasons was not compelled to participate in the Spanish Civil War and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.

The war opened Sartres eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it the world itself destroyed Sartres illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time. Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the Socialisme et Liberté resistance group. In 1943 after the group disbanded Sartre joined a writers Resistance group in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously and it was due to this crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature.

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartres work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal Les Temps modernes in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal and thus himself with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment. Yet this alignment was indefinite directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

Sartres philosophy lent itself to his being a public intellectual. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined nor definitely finished; instead in true existential fashion culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention. This marks Sartre the intellectual as a pragmatist willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in human freedom preferring to retain a pacifists objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines. Therefore he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects the international world order the political and economic organisation of contemporary society especially France the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens the educational system the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.

Sartre always sympathized with the Left and supported the French Communist Party until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the Liberation the PCF were infuriated by Sartres philosophy which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartres own existentialism. From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes objecting to its authoritarian tendencies. In the late 1960s Sartre supported the Maoists a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties. However despite aligning with the Maoists Sartre said after the May events If one rereads all my books one will realize that I have not changed profoundly and that I have always remained an anarchist. He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters he set forth a body of work which reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there. The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartres opinion the traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior but there is a recognition that the new technological mass media forms must be embraced if Sartres ethical and political goals as an authentic committed intellectual are to be achieved the demystification of bourgeois political practices and the raising of the consciousness both political and cultural of the working class.

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough however to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example and vice versa.

Sartres role as a public intellectual occasionally put him in physical danger such as in June 1961 when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian self-determination at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from Oran Algeria.

Sartres role in this conflict included his comments in his preface to Frantz Fanons The Wretched of the Earth that To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time there remains a dead man and a free man. This comment led to some criticisms from the right such as by Brian C. Anderson and Michael Walzer. Writing for the Hoover Institution Walzer suggested that Sartre a European was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.

However Sartres stances regarding post-colonial conflict have not been entirely without controversy on the left; Sartres preface is omitted from some editions of The Wretched of the Earth printed after 1967. The reason for this is for his public support for Israel in the Six-Day War. Fanons widow Josie considered Sartres pro-Israel stance as inconsistent with the anti-colonialist position of the book so she omitted the preface. When interviewed at Howard University in 1978 she explained when Israel declared war on the Arab countries there was a great pro-Zionist movement in favor of Israel among western intellectuals. Sartre took part in this movement. He signed petitions favoring Israel. I felt that his pro-Zionist attitudes were incompatible with Fanons work. Recent reprints of Fanons book have generally included Sartres preface.

Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known Huis-clos contains the famous line Lenfer cest les autres usually translated as Hell is other people. Aside from the impact of Nausea Sartres major work of fiction was The Roads to Freedom trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartres ideas. In this way Roads to Freedom presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to existentialism.

John Huston got Sartre to script his film Freud The Secret Passion. However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the films credits. Nevertheless many key elements from Sartres script survive in the finished film.

Despite their similarities as polemicists novelists adapters and playwrights Sartres literary work has been counterposed often pejoratively to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Church placed Sartres œuvre on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ."

Albert Schweitzer,"Ludwig Philipp Albert Schweitzer OM ; 14 January 1875 4 September 1965 was an Alsatian polymath. He was a theologian organist musicologist writer humanitarian philosopher and physician. A Lutheran Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by the historical-critical method current at this time as well as the traditional Christian view. His contributions to the interpretation of Pauline Christianity concern the role of Pauls mysticism of being in Christ as primary and the doctrine of Justification by Faith as secondary.

He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of Reverence for Life becoming the eighth Frenchman to be awarded that prize. His philosophy was expressed in many ways but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné which up to 1958 was situated in French Equatorial Africa and after this in Gabon. As a music scholar and organist he studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and influenced the Organ Reform Movement .

Schweitzer was born 14 January 1875 in Kaysersberg in Alsace in what had less than four years previously become The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine in The German Empire; he later became a citizen of France after World War I when Alsace became French territory. He was the son of Louis Schweitzer and Adèle Schillinger. He spent his childhood in Gunsbach also in Alsace where his father the local Lutheran-Evangelical pastor of the EPCAAL taught him how to play music. The tiny village would become home to the Association Internationale Albert Schweitzer . The medieval parish church of Gunsbach was shared by the Protestant and Catholic congregations which held their prayers in different areas at different times on Sundays. This compromise arose after the Protestant Reformation and the Thirty Years War. Schweitzer the pastors son grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose.

Schweitzers first language was the Alsatian dialect of German. At the Mulhouse gymnasium he received his Abitur in 1893. He studied organ in Mulhouse from 1885 to 1893 with Eugène Munch organist at the Protestant cathedral who inspired Schweitzer with his enthusiasm for the music of German composer Richard Wagner. In 1893 he played for the French organist Charles-Marie Widor for whom Johann Sebastian Bachs organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor deeply impressed agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee and a great and influential friendship thus began.

From 1893 Schweitzer studied Protestant theology at the Kaiser Wilhelm University in Strasbourg. There he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor Gustav Jacobsthal and associated closely with Ernest Munch the brother of his former teacher organist of St William church who was also a passionate admirer of J. S. Bachs music. Schweitzer served his one-year compulsory military service in 1894. Schweitzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the Bayreuth Festival to see Wagners Der Ring des Nibelungen and Parsifal both of which impressed him. In 1898 he returned to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on The Religious Philosophy of Kant at the Sorbonne and to study in earnest with Widor. Here he often met with the elderly Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. He also studied piano at that time with Marie Jaëll. In 1899 Schweitzer spent the summer semester at the University of Berlin and eventually obtained his theology degree at the University of Strasbourg. He published his PhD thesis at the University of Tübingen in 1899.

In 1905 Schweitzer began his study of medicine at the University of Strasbourg culminating in the degree of M.D. in 1913.

Schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist dedicated also to the rescue restoration and study of historic pipe organs. With theological insight he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in J. S. Bachs religious music. In 1899 he astonished Widor by explaining figures and motifs in Bachs Chorale Preludes as painter-like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based. They were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas conceived visually. Widor had not grown up with knowledge of the old Lutheran hymns.

The exposition of these ideas encouraged by Widor and Munch became Schweitzers last task and appeared in the masterly study J. S. Bach Le Musicien-Poète written in French and published in 1905. There was great demand for a German edition but instead of translating it he decided to rewrite it. The result was two volumes which were published in 1908 and translated into English by Ernest Newman in 1911.Ernst Cassirer a contemporaneous German philosopher called it one of the best interpretations of Bach. During its preparation Schweitzer became a friend of Cosima Wagner then resident in Strasbourg with whom he had many theological and musical conversations exploring his view of Bachs descriptive music and playing the major Chorale Preludes for her at the Temple Neuf. Schweitzers interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of Bachs music. He became a welcome guest at the Wagners home Wahnfried. He also corresponded with composer Clara Faisst who became a good friend.

His pamphlet The Art of Organ Building and Organ Playing in Germany and France effectively launched the 20th-century Orgelbewegung which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principlesalthough this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than Schweitzer had intended. In 1909 he addressed the Third Congress of the International Society of Music at Vienna on the subject. Having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ-builders in several European countries he produced a very considered report. This provided the basis for the International Regulations for Organ Building. He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic reed pipes and with the classical Alsace Silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes all in registers regulated to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness different voices singing the same music together.

Schweitzer also studied piano under Isidor Philipp head of the piano department at the Paris Conservatory.

In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society a choir dedicated to performing J. S. Bachs music for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at Barcelona Spain and often travelled there for that purpose. He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bachs organ works with detailed analysis of each work in three languages . Schweitzer who insisted that the score should show Bachs notation with no additional markings wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos six volumes were published in 191214. Three more to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzers analyses were to be worked on in Africa but these were never completed perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.

On departure for Lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a pedal piano a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard. Built especially for the tropics it was delivered by river in a huge dug-out canoe to Lambaréné packed in a zinc-lined case. At first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art and fell out of practice but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach Mendelssohn Widor César Franck and Max Reger systematically. It became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons. Schweitzers pedal piano was still in use at Lambaréné in 1946. According to a visitor Dr. Gaine Cannon of Balsam Grove N.C. the old dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by Dr. Schweitzer in 1962 and stories told that his fingers were still lively on the old instrument at 88 years of age.

Sir Donald Tovey dedicated his conjectural completion of Bachs The Art of Fugue to Schweitzer.

Schweitzers recordings of organ-music and his innovative recording technique are described below.

One of his pupils was conductor and composer Hans Münch.

In 1899 Schweitzer became a deacon at the church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg. In 1900 with the completion of his licentiate in theology he was ordained as curate and that year he witnessed the Oberammergau Passion Play. In the following year he became provisional Principal of the Theological College of Saint Thomas from which he had just graduated and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent.

In 1906 he published Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung . This book which established his reputation was first published in English in 1910 as The Quest of the Historical Jesus. Under this title the book became famous in the English-speaking world. A second German edition was published in 1913 containing theologically significant revisions and expansions this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001. In 1931 he published Mystik des Apostels Paulus ; a second edition was published in 1953.

In The Quest Schweitzer criticised the liberal view put forward by liberal and romantic scholars during the first Quest for the historical Jesus. Schweitzer maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus own convictions which reflected late Jewish eschatology and apocalypticism. Schweitzer writes

The Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messiah who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consecration never existed. He is a figure designed by rationalism endowed with life by liberalism and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb. This image has not been destroyed from outside; it has fallen to pieces...

Instead of these liberal and romantic views Schweitzer wrote that Jesus and his followers expected the imminent end of the world.

Schweitzer concluded his treatment of Jesus with what has been called the most famous words of twentieth-century theology

In The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle Schweitzer first distinguishes between two categories of mysticism primitive and developed. Primitive mysticism has not yet risen to a conception of the universal and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super-earthly temporal and eternal. Additionally he argues that this view of a union with the divinity brought about by efficacious ceremonies is found even in quite primitive religions.

On the other hand a more developed form of mysticism can be found in the Greek mystery-cults that were popular in first-century A.D. society. These included the cults of Attis Osiris and Mithras. A developed form of mysticism is attained when the conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself. Schweitzer claims that this form of mysticism is more intellectual and can be found among the Brahmans and in the Buddha in Platonism in Stoicism in Spinoza Schopenhauer and Hegel.

Next Schweitzer poses the question Of what precise kind then is the mysticism of Paul He locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mysticism and developed mysticism. Paul stands high above primitive mysticism due to his intellectual writings but never speaks of being one with God or being in God. Instead he conceives of sonship to God as mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ. He summarizes Pauline mysticism as being in Christ rather than being in God.

Pauls imminent eschatology causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ. Christ-mysticism holds the field until God-mysticism becomes possible which is in the near future. Therefore Schweitzer argues that Paul is the only theologian who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of being-in-God. Rather Paul uses the phrase being-in-Christ to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God. Additionally Schweitzer explains how the experience of being-in-Christ is not a static partaking in the spiritual being of Christ but as the real co-experiencing of His dying and rising again. The realistic partaking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community.

One of Schweitzers major arguments in The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle is that Pauls mysticism marked by his phrase being in Christ gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology. Rather than reading justification by faith as the main topic of Pauline thought which has been the most popular argument set forward by Martin Luther Schweitzer argues that Pauls emphasis was on the mystical union with God by being in Christ. Jaroslav Pelikan in his foreword to The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle points out that

Schweitzer contrasts Pauls realistic dying and rising with Christ to the symbolism of Hellenism. Although Paul is widely influenced by Hellenistic thought he is not controlled by it. Schweitzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the realistic dying and rising with Christ rather than the symbolic Hellenistic act of becoming like Christ through deification. After baptism Christians are continually renewed throughout their lifetimes due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ . On the other hand the Hellenist lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience.

Another major difference between Pauls realism and Hellenistic symbolism is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter. Schweitzer unabashedly emphasizes the fact that Pauls thought follows predestinarian lines. He explains only the man who is elected thereto can enter into relation with God. Although every human being is invited to become a Christian only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through baptism can share in the realistic dying and rising with Christ.

At the age of 30 in 1905 Schweitzer answered the call of The Society of the Evangelist Missions of Paris which was looking for a physician. The committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer considering his Lutheran theology to be incorrect. He could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties. Amid a hail of protests from his friends family and colleagues he resigned his post and re-entered the university as a student in a three-year course towards the degree of Doctorate in Medicine a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude. He planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing rather than through the verbal process of preaching and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching.

Even in his study of medicine and through his clinical course Schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher-scientist. By extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911. His medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus The Psychiatric Study of Jesus. He defended Jesus mental health in it. In June 1912 he married Helene Bresslau municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan-Germanist historian Harry Bresslau.

In 1912 now armed with a medical degree Schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a physician to work at his own expense in the Paris Missionary Societys mission at Lambaréné on the Ogooué river in what is now Gabon in Africa . He refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted. Through concerts and other fund-raising he was ready to equip a small hospital. In early 1913 he and his wife set off to establish a hospital near an existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles upstream from the mouth of the Ogooué at Port Gentil but downstream of most tributaries so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.

In the first nine months he and his wife had about 2000 patients to examine some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometres to reach him. In addition to injuries he was often treating severe sandflea and crawcraw sores framboesia tropical eating sores heart disease tropical dysentery tropical malaria sleeping sickness leprosy fevers strangulated hernias necrosis abdominal tumours and chronic constipation and nicotine poisoning while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings fetishism and fear of cannibalism among the Mbahouin.

Schweitzers wife Helene Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations. After briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut in late 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron with two 13-foot rooms and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory were built like native huts of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph a French-speaking Galoa who first came as a patient.

After World War I broke out in July 1914 Schweitzer and his wife German citizens in a French colony when the countries were at war were put under supervision by the French military at Lambaréné where Schweitzer continued his work. In 1917 exhausted by over four years work and by tropical anaemia they were taken to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. In July 1918 after being transferred to his home in Alsace he was a free man again. At this time Schweitzer born a German citizen had his parents former French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen. Then working as medical assistant and assistant-pastor in Strasbourg he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization which had occupied his mind since 1900. By 1920 his health recovering he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund-raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon. In 1922 he delivered the Dale Memorial Lectures in the University of Oxford and from these in the following year appeared Volumes I and II of his great work The Decay and Restoration of Civilization and Civilization and Ethics. The two remaining volumes on The World-View of Reverence for Life and a fourth on the Civilized State were never completed.

In 1924 Schweitzer returned without his wife with an Oxford undergraduate Noel Gillespie as his assistant. Everything was heavily decayed and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff nurse Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann joined him in 1924 and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 19256 new hospital buildings were constructed and also a ward for white patients so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and tryparsamide. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion . With the new hospital built and the medical team established Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927 this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.

He was there again from 1929 to 1932. Gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged not only in Europe but worldwide. There was a further period of work in 1935. In January 1937 he returned again to Lambaréné and continued working there throughout World War II.

The journalist James Cameron visited Lambaréné in 1953 and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schweitzer and his staff. The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people. Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time according to a BBC dramatisation he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé.

The poor conditions of the hospital in Lambaréné were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist Chinua Achebe in his essay on Joseph Conrads novel Heart of Darkness In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother. And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being.

Schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus call to become fishers of men but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European colonizers

Who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they have suffered at the hands of Europeans... If a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible.

Schweitzer was one of colonialisms harshest critics. In a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905 before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a physician in Africa he said

Our culture divides people into two classes civilized men a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying; and others who have only the human form who may perish or go to the dogs for all the civilized men care.

Oh this noble culture of ours It speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different colour or because they cannot help themselves. This culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights...

I will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice. People robbed native inhabitants of their land made slaves of them let loose the scum of mankind upon them. Think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic gifts and everything else we have done... We decimate them and then by the stroke of a pen we take their land so they have nothing left at all...

If all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God or the American God or the British God and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be Christianthen the name of Jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery. And the Christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people. The name of Jesus has become a curse and our Christianityyours and minehas become a falsehood and a disgrace if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated. For every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus name someone must step in to help in Jesus name; for every person who robbed someone must bring a replacement; for everyone who cursed someone must bless.

Schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic in his attitude towards Africans. For instance he thought that Gabonese independence came too early without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances. Edgar Berman quotes Schweitzer as having said in 1960 No society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow. Schweitzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks while also sometimes characterizing them as children. He summarized his views on European-African relations by saying With regard to the negroes then I have coined the formula I am your brother it is true but your elder brother.Chinua Achebe has criticized him for this characterization though Achebe acknowledges that Schweitzers use of the word brother at all was for a European of the early 20th century an unusual expression of human solidarity between Europeans and Africans. Schweitzer eventually emended and complicated this notion with his later statement that The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed.

American journalist John Gunther visited Lambaréné in the 1950s and reported Schweitzers patronizing attitude towards Africans. He also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers. By comparison his English contemporary Albert Ruskin Cook in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Luganda. After three decades in Africa Schweitzer still depended on Europe for nurses.

The keynote of Schweitzers personal philosophy was the idea of Reverence for Life . He thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation.

In the Preface to Civilization and Ethics he argued that Western philosophy from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it. But no such meaning was found and the rational life-affirming optimism of the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate. A rift opened between this world-view as material knowledge and the life-view understood as Will expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Schopenhauer onward. Scientific materialism portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics entirely an expression of the will-to-live.

Schweitzer wrote True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness and this may be formulated as follows I am life which wills to live and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live. In nature one form of life must always prey upon another. However human consciousness holds an awareness of and sympathy for the will of other beings to live. An ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible.

Though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it the will-to-live constantly renews itself for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon. Life and love are rooted in this same principle in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe. Ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself. Even so Schweitzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied not least in the European Middle Ages and in the Indian Brahminic philosophy.

For Schweitzer mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization the world-view must derive from the life-view not vice versa. Respect for life overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature. In contemplation of the will-to-life respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.

Such was the theory which Schweitzer sought to put into practice in his own life. According to some authors Schweitzers thought and specifically his development of reverence for life was influenced by Indian religious thought and in particular the Jain principle of ahimsa or non-violence. Albert Schweitzer noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book Indian Thought and Its Development

The laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind. Starting from its principle founded on world and life denial of abstention from action ancient Indian thought and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds. So far as we know this is for the first time clearly expressed by Jainism.

Further on ahimsa and the reverence for life in the same book he elaborates on the ancient Indian didactic work of the Tirukkural which he observed that like the Buddha and the Bhagavad Gita stands for the commandment not to kill and not to damage. Translating several couplets from the work he remarked that the Kural insists on the idea that good must be done for its own sake and said There hardly exists in the literature of the world a collection of maxims in which we find so much lofty wisdom.

After the birth of their daughter Alberts wife Helene Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné due to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald Baden-Württemberg where he was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.

From 1939 to 1948 he stayed in Lambaréné unable to go back to Europe because of the war. Three years after the end of World War II in 1948 he returned for the first time to Europe and kept travelling back and forth as long as he was able. During his return visits to his home village of Gunsbach Schweitzer continued to make use of the family house which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work. His life was portrayed in the 1952 movie Il est minuit Docteur Schweitzer starring Pierre Fresnay as Albert Schweitzer and Jeanne Moreau as his nurse Marie. Schweitzer inspired actor Hugh OBrian when OBrian visited in Africa. OBrian returned to the United States and founded the Hugh OBrian Youth Leadership Foundation .

Schweitzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize of 1952 accepting the prize with the speech The Problem of Peace. From 1952 until his death he worked against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons with Albert Einstein Otto Hahn and Bertrand Russell. In 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in Peace or Atomic War. In 1957 Schweitzer was one of the founders of The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. On 23 April 1957 Schweitzer made his Declaration of Conscience speech; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons. His speech ended The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for.

Weeks prior to his death an American film crew was allowed to visit Schweitzer and Drs. Muntz and Friedman both Holocaust survivors to record his work and daily life at the hospital. The film The Legacy of Albert Schweitzer narrated by Henry Fonda was produced by Warner Brothers and aired once. It resides in their vault today in deteriorating condition. Although several attempts have been made to restore and re-air the film all access has been denied.

In 1955 he was made an honorary member of the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II. He was also a chevalier of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem.

Schweitzer died on 4 September 1965 at his beloved hospital in Lambaréné now in independent Gabon. His grave on the banks of the Ogooué River is marked by a cross he made himself.

His cousin Anne-Marie Schweitzer Sartre was the mother of Jean-Paul Sartre. Her father Charles Schweitzer was the older brother of Albert Schweitzers father Louis Théophile.

Schweitzer is often cited in vegetarian literature as being an advocate of vegetarianism in his later years. Schweitzer was not a vegetarian in his earlier life. For example in 1950 biographer Magnus C. Ratter commented that Schweitzer never commit himself to the anti- vivisection vegetarian or pacifist positions though his thought leads in this direction. Biographer James Bentley has written that Schweitzer became a vegetarian after his wifes death in 1957 and he was living almost entirely on lentil soup. In contrast to this historian David N. Stamos has written that Schweitzer was not a vegetarian in his personal life nor imposed it on his missionary hospital but he did help animals and was opposed to hunting. Stamos noted that Schweitzer held the view that evolution ingrained humans with an instinct for meat so it was useless in trying to deny it.

The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship was founded in 1940 by Schweitzer to unite US supporters in filling the gap in support for his Hospital when his European supply lines were cut off by war and continues to support the Lambaréné Hospital today. Schweitzer considered his ethic of Reverence for Life not his hospital his most important legacy saying that his Lambaréné Hospital was just my own improvisation on the theme of Reverence for Life. Everyone can have their own Lambaréné. Today ASF helps large numbers of young Americans in health-related professional fields find or create their own Lambaréné in the US or internationally. ASF selects and supports nearly 250 new US and Africa Schweitzer Fellows each year from over 100 of the leading US schools of medicine nursing public health and every other field with some relation to health . The peer-supporting lifelong network of Schweitzer Fellows for Life numbered over 2000 members in 2008 and is growing by nearly 1000 every four years. Nearly 150 of these Schweitzer Fellows have served at the Hospital in Lambaréné for three-month periods during their last year of medical school.

The prize was first awarded on 29 May 2011 to Eugen Drewermann and the physician couple Rolf and Raphaela Maibach in Königsfeld im Schwarzwald where Schweitzers former residence now houses the Albert Schweitzer Museum.

Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD. During 1934 and 1935 he resided in Britain delivering the Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh University and those on Religion in Modern Civilization at Oxford and London. He had originally conducted trials for recordings for HMV on the organ of the old Queens Hall in London. These records did not satisfy him the instrument being too harsh. In mid-December 1935 he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All Hallows Barking-by-the-Tower London. Then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of Ste Aurélie in Strasbourg on a mid-18th-century organ by Johann Andreas Silbermann an organ-builder greatly revered by Bach which had been restored by the Lorraine organ-builder Frédéric Härpfer shortly before the First World War. These recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October 1936.

Schweitzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bachs music. Known as the Schweitzer Technique it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single cardioid microphone is placed on axis bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed panned hard left and right one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.

Altogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of César Franck. The Bach titles were mainly distributed as follows

Later recordings were made at Parish church Günsbach These recordings were made by C. Robert Fine during the time Dr. Schweitzer was being filmed in Günsbach for the documentary Albert Schweitzer. Fine originally self-released the recordings but later licensed the masters to Columbia.

The above were released in the United States as Columbia Masterworks boxed set SL-175."
Michel Serres,"Michel Serres was a French philosopher theorist and writer. His works explore themes of science time and death and later incorporated prose.

The son of a bargeman Serres entered Frances naval academy the École Navale in 1949 and the École Normale Supérieure in 1952. He aggregated in 1955 having studied philosophy. He spent the next few years as a naval officer before finally receiving his doctorate in 1968 from the University of Paris and began teaching in 1969 at the University of Paris I.

As a child Serres witnessed firsthand the violence and devastation of war. I was six for my first dead bodies he told Bruno Latour. These formative experiences led him consistently to eschew scholarship based upon models of war suspicion and criticism.

Over the next twenty years Serres earned a reputation as a spell-binding lecturer and as the author of remarkably beautiful and enigmatic prose so reliant on the sonorities of French that it is considered practically untranslatable. He took as his subjects such diverse topics as the mythical Northwest Passage the concept of the parasite and the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger. More generally Serres was interested in developing a philosophy of science which does not rely on a metalanguage in which a single account of science is privileged and regarded as accurate. To do this he relied on the concept of translation between accounts rather than settling on one as authoritative. For this reason Serres has relied on the figure of Hermes and angels as messengers who translate back and forth between domains .

In 1990 Serres was elected to the Académie française in recognition of his position as one of Frances most prominent intellectuals. He was an influence on intellectuals such as Bruno Latour and Steven Connor. He served as a Professor of French at Stanford University.

In an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist Serres expressed interest in the emergence of a new political philosophy that addresses the digital context of the 21st century I think that out of this place of no law that is the Internet there will soon emerge a new law completely different from that which organized our old metric space.

Serres was a vocal enthusiast for freely accessible knowledge especially Wikipedia.

In 2012 Serres was awarded the Meister Eckhart Prize and in 2013 he was awarded the Dan David Prize. He died on 1 June 2019 at the age of 88."
Antonin Sertillanges,"Antonin-Gilbert Sertillanges O.P. was a French Catholic philosopher and spiritual writer.

Born Antonin-Dalmace he took the name Antonin-Gilbert when he entered the Dominican order. In 1893 he founded the Revue Thomiste and later became professor of moral philosophy at the Institut Catholique de Paris. Henri Daniel-Rops wrote that it was rumored that President Raymond Poincaré asked Léon-Adolphe Cardinal Amette Archbishop of Paris for a reply to Pope Benedict XVs peace proposals and that Amette passed the request along to Sertillanges; in any event Amette gave his imprimatur to this reply on 5 December 1917 five days before it was made public. In The Heroic Life Sertillanges had defended Benedicts attitude toward peace but in The French Peace Sertillanges said Most Holy Father we cannot for an instant entertain your appeals for peace.

His scholarly work was concerned with the moral theory of Thomas Aquinas. In the English-speaking world he is best known for two non-specialist works. The Intellectual Life is a practical guide for how to structure ones life so as to make progress as a scholar. What Jesus Saw from the Cross is a spiritual work that drew upon the time Sertillanges spent living in Jerusalem. Certain of Sertillanges works are concerned with political theory with French identity and the structure of the traditional French family."
Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès,"Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès usually known as the abbé Sieyès was a French Roman Catholic abbé clergyman and political writer who was a chief political theorist of the French Revolution ; he also held offices in the governments of the French Consulate and the First French Empire . His pamphlet What Is the Third Estate became the political manifesto of the Revolution which facilitated transforming the Estates-General into the National Assembly in June 1789. He was offered and refused an office in the French Directory . After becoming a director in 1799 Sieyès was among the instigators of the Coup of 18 Brumaire which installed Napoleon Bonaparte to power. Moreover apart from his political life Sieyès coined the term sociologie and contributed to the nascent social sciences.

Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès was born on 3 May 1748 the fifth child of Honoré and Annabelle Sieyès in the southern French town of Fréjus. Honoré Sieyès was a local tax collector of modest income; although they claimed some noble blood the family Sieyès were commoners. Emmanuel-Joseph received his earliest education from tutors and Jesuits; and later attended the collège of the Doctrinaires of Draguignan. His ambition to become a professional soldier was thwarted by frail health which combined with the piety of his parents led to pursuing a religious career; to that effect the vicar-general of Fréjus aided Emmanuel-Joseph out of obligation to his father Honoré.

Sieyès spent ten years at the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. There he studied theology and engineering to prepare himself to enter the priesthood. He quickly gained a reputation at the school for his aptitude and interest in the sciences combined with his obsession over the new philosophic principles and dislike for conventional theology. Sieyès was educated for priesthood in the Catholic Church at the Sorbonne. While there he became influenced by the teachings of John Locke Condillac Quesnay Mirabeau Turgot the Encyclopédistes and other Enlightenment political thinkers all in preference to theology. In 1770 he obtained his first theology diploma ranking at the bottom of the list of passing candidates a reflection of his antipathy toward his religious education. In 1772 he was ordained as a priest and two years later he obtained his theology license.

Despite Sieyès embrace of Enlightenment thinking he was ordained to the priesthood in 1773 but was not hired immediately. He spent time researching philosophy and developing music until about a year later in October 1774 when as the result of demands by powerful friends he was promised a canonry in Brittany. Unfortunately for Sieyès this canonry went into effect only when the preceding holder died. At the end of 1775 Sieyès acquired his first real position as secretary to the bishop of Tréguier where he spent two years as deputy of the diocese. It is here that he sat in the Estates of Brittany and became disgusted with the immense power the privileged classes held. In 1780 the bishop of Tréguier was transferred to the bishopric of Chartres and Sieyès accompanied him there as his vicar general eventually becoming a canon of the cathedral and chancellor of the diocese of Chartres. Due to the fact that the bishop of Tréguier had high regards for Sieyès he was able to act as a representative of his diocese in the Upper Chamber of the Clergy. It was during this time that Sieyès became aware of the ease with which nobles advanced in ecclesiastical offices compared to commoners. In particular he was resentful of the privileges granted to the nobles within the Church system and thought the patronage system was a humiliation for commoners.

While remaining in ecclesiastical offices Sieyès maintained a religious cynicism at odds with his position. By the time he determined to enter priesthood Sieyès had freed himself from all superstitious sentiments and ideas. Even when corresponding with his deeply religious father Sieyès showed a severe lack of piety for the man in charge of the diocese of Chartres. It is theorised that Sieyès accepted a religious career not because he had any sort of strong religious inclination but because he considered it the only means to advance his career as a political writer.

In 1788 Louis XVI of France proposed the convocation of the Estates-General of France after an interval of more than a century and a half. This proposal and Jacques Neckers invitation to French writers to state their views as to the organization of society by Estates enabled Sieyès to publish his celebrated January 1789 pamphlet Quest-ce que le tiers-état . He begins his answer

What is the Third Estate Everything. What has it been hitherto in the political order Nothing. What does it desire to be Something.

This phrase which was to remain famous is said to have been inspired by Nicolas Chamfort. The pamphlet was very successful and its author despite his clerical vocation was elected as the last of the deputies to the Third Estate from Paris to the Estates-General. He played his main role in the opening years of the Revolution participating in the final drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen expanding on the theories of national sovereignty popular sovereignty and representation implied in his pamphlet with a distinction between active and passive citizens that justified suffrage limited to male owners of property.

Sieyèss pamphlet incited a radical reaction from its audience because it involved the political issues of the day and twisted them in a more revolutionary direction. In the third chapter of the pamphlet Sieyès proposed that the Third Estate wanted to be something. But he also stated that in allowing the privileged orders to exist they are asking to become the least thing possible. The usage of such rhetoric in his pamphlet appealed to common causes to unite the audience. At the same time it influenced them to move beyond simple demands and take a more radical position on the nature of government. In this case the radical position taken by the Third Estate created a sense of awareness that the problems of France were not simply a matter of addressing royal tyranny but that unequal privileges under the law had divided the nation. It was from this point that the Revolutions struggle for fair distribution of power and equal rights began in earnest.

Sieyèss pamphlet played a key role in shaping the currents of revolutionary thought that propelled France towards the French Revolution. In his pamphlet he outlined the desires and frustrations of the alienated class of people that made up the Third Estate. He attacked the foundations of the French Ancien Régime by arguing the nobility to be a fraudulent institution preying on an overburdened and despondent bourgeoisie. The pamphlet voiced concerns that were to become crucial matters of debate during the convocation of the Estates-General of 1789.

Whereas the aristocracy defined themselves as an élite ruling class charged with maintaining the social order in France Sieyès saw the Third Estate as representing the nation whether or not the other two orders were present. The pamphlet placed sovereignty not in the hands of aristocrats but instead defined the nation of France by its productive orders composed of those who would generate services and produce goods for the benefit of the entire society. These included not only those involved in agricultural labor and craftsmanship but also merchants brokers lawyers financiers and others providing services. Sieyès challenged the hierarchical order of society by redefining who represented the nation. In his pamphlet he condemns the privileged orders by saying their members were enjoying the best products of society without contributing to their production. Sieyès essentially argued that the aristocracys privileges established it as an alien body acting outside of the nation of France and deemed noble privilege treason to the commonwealth.

Sieyèss pamphlet had a significant influence on the structural concerns that arose surrounding the convocation of the Estates general. Specifically the Third Estate demanded that the number of deputies for their order be equal to that of the two privileged orders combined and most controversially that the States General Vote Not by Orders but by Heads. The pamphlet took these issues to the masses and their partial appeasement was met with revolutionary reaction. By addressing the issues of representation directly Sieyès inspired resentment and agitation that united the third estate against the feudalistic traditions of the Ancien Régime. As a result the Third Estate demanded the reorganization of the Estates General but the two other orders proved unable or unwilling to provide a solution. Sieyès proposed that the members of the First and Second order join the Third Estate and become a united body to represent the nation as a whole. He not only suggested an invitation however but also stated that the Third Estate had the right to consider those who denied this invitation to be in default of their national responsibility. The Third Estate adopted this measure on 5 June 1789; by doing so they assumed the authority to represent the nation. Sieyès convinced the Third Estate to adopt the term National Assembly and was elected by the Assembly to its constitutional committee in July of 1789.

Serving on the constitutional committee Sieyès argued that the Assembly should not need to seek the King Louis XVI approval on constitutional matters. Sieyès advocated for equality of voting power a unicameral legislative body and the absence of a royal veto over the actions of the legislature. Taking the position that the National Assembly held absolute power as the only true representative of the nation Sieyès rejected arguments that the King should be able to initiate new elections for the Assembly or have the power to veto legislation. Sieyès believed that representatives to the Assembly must be free both from influence from above by the King and from influence from below by the people. While voters had the right to put into or take out representatives from power for the term they were elected Sieyès held representatives should be answerable to no one. In September of 1789 Sieyès triumphed over the more moderate members of the Assembly led by Mounier when the Assembly voted for a unicameral legislature by a vote of 849 to 89 with 122 abstaining.

Although not noted as a public speaker Sieyès held major political influence and he recommended the decision of the Estates to reunite its chamber as the National Assembly although he opposed the abolition of tithes and the confiscation of Church lands. His opposition to the abolition of tithes discredited him in the National Assembly and he was never able to regain his authority. Elected to the special committee on the constitution he opposed the right of absolute veto for the King of France which Honoré Mirabeau unsuccessfully supported. He had considerable influence on the framing of the departmental system but after the spring of 1790 he was eclipsed by other politicians and was elected only once to the post of fortnightly president of the Constituent Assembly.

Like all other members of the Constituent Assembly he was excluded from the Legislative Assembly by the ordinance initially proposed by Maximilien Robespierre that decreed that none of its members should be eligible for the next legislature. He reappeared in the third national Assembly known as the National Convention of the French Republic . He voted for the death of Louis XVI but not in the contemptuous terms sometimes ascribed to him. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project. Menaced by the Reign of Terror and offended by its character Sieyès even abjured his faith at the time of the installation of the Cult of Reason; afterwards when asked what he had done during the Terror he famously replied Jai vécu .

Ultimately Sieyès failed to establish the kind of bourgeois revolution he had hoped for one of representative order devoted to the peaceful pursuit of material comfort. His initial purpose was to instigate change in a more passive way and to establish a constitutional monarchy. According to William Sewell Sieyès pamphlet set the tone and direction of The French Revolution but its author could hardly control the Revolutions course over the long run. Even after 1791 when the monarchy seemed to many to be doomed Sieyès continued to assert his belief in the monarchy which indicated he did not intend for the Revolution to take the course it did.During the period he served in the National Assembly Sieyès wanted to establish a constitution that would guarantee the rights of French men and would uphold equality under the law as the social goal of the Revolution; he was ultimately unable to accomplish his goal.

After the execution of Robespierre in 1794 Sieyès reemerged as an important political player during the constitutional debates that followed. In 1795 he went on a diplomatic mission to The Hague and was instrumental in drawing up a treaty between the French and Batavian republics. He resented the Constitution of the Year III enacted by the Directory and refused to serve as a Director of the Republic. In May 1798 he went as the plenipotentiary of France to the court of Berlin in order to try to induce Prussia to ally with France against the Second Coalition; this effort ultimately failed. His prestige grew nonetheless and he was made Director of France in place of Jean-François Rewbell in May 1799.

Nevertheless Sieyès considered ways to overthrow the Directory and is said to have taken in view the replacement of the government with unlikely rulers such as Archduke Charles of Austria and Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick . He attempted to undermine the constitution and thus caused the revived Jacobin Club to be closed while making offers to General Joubert for a coup détat.

The death of Joubert at the Battle of Novi and the return of Napoleon Bonaparte from the Egypt campaign put an end to this project but Sieyès regained influence by reaching a new understanding with Bonaparte. In the coup of 18 Brumaire Sieyès and his allies dissolved the Directory allowing Napoleon to seize power. Thereafter Sieyès produced the constitution which he had long been planning only to have it completely remodeled by Bonaparte who thereby achieved a coup within a coup Bonapartes Constitution of the Year VIII became the basis of the French Consulate of 17991804.

The Corps législatif appointed Bonaparte Sieyès and Roger Ducos as Consuls of the French Republic. In order to once again begin the function of government these three men took the oath of Inviolable fidelity to the sovereignty of the people; to the French Republic one and indivisible; to equality liberty and the representative system. Although Sieyès had many ideas a lot of them were disfavored by Bonaparte and Roger-Ducos. One aspect that was agreed upon was the structure of power. A list of active citizens formed the basis of the proposed political structure. This list was to choose one-tenth of its members to form a communal list eligible for local office; from the communal list one-tenth of its members were to form a departmental list; finally one further list was made up from one-tenth of the members of the departmental list to create the national list. This national list is where the highest officials of the land were to be chosen.

Sieyès envisioned a Tribunat and a College des Conservateurs to act as the shell of the national government. The Tribunat would present laws and discuss ratification of these laws in front of a jury. This jury would not have any say in terms of what the laws granted consist of but rather whether or not these laws passed. The College des Conservateurs would be renewed from the national list. The main responsibility of the College des Conservateurs was to choose the members of the two legislative bodies and protect the constitution by right of absorption. By this curious provision the College could forcibly elect to its ranks any individual deemed dangerous to the safety of the state who would then be disqualified from any other office. This was a way to keep a closer eye on anyone who threatened the state. The power of the College des Conservateurs was extended to electing the titular head of government the Grand-Electeur. The Grand-Electeur would hold office for life but have no power. If the Grand-Electeur threatened to become dangerous the College des Conservateurs would absorb him. The central idea of Sieyès plan was a division of power.

Sieyès soon retired from the post of provisional Consul which he had accepted after 18 Brumaire and became one of the first members of the Sénat conservateur ; this concession was attributed to the large estate at Crosne that he received from Napoleon. After the plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise in late December 1800 Sieyès defended the arbitrary and illegal proceedings whereby Napoleon rid himself of the leading Jacobins.

During the era of the First Empire Sieyès rarely emerged from his retirement. When Napoleon briefly returned to power in 1815 Sieyès was named to the Chamber of Peers. In 1816 after the Second Restoration Sieyès was expelled from the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences by Louis XVIII. He then moved to Brussels but returned to France after the July Revolution of 1830. He died in Paris in 1836 at the age of 88.

In 1795 Sieyès became one of the first members of what would become the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute of France. When the Académie Française was reorganized in 1803 he was elected in the second class replacing in chair 31 Jean Sylvain Bailly who had been guillotined on 12 November 1793 during the Reign of Terror. However after the second Restoration in 1815 Sieyès was expelled for his role in the execution of King Louis XVI and was replaced by the Marquis of Lally-Tollendal who was named to the Academy by a royal decree.

In 1780 Sieyès coined the term sociologie in an unpublished manuscript. The term was used again fifty years later by the philosopher Auguste Comte to refer to the science of society which is known in English as sociology.

Sieyès was always considered intellectual and intelligent by his peers and mentors alike. Through the virtue of his own thoughts he progressed in his ideologies from personal experiences. Starting at a young age he began to feel repulsion towards the privileges of the nobility. He deemed this advantage gained by noble right as unfair to those of the lower class. This distaste he felt for the privileged class became evident during his time at the Estates of Brittany where he was able to observe with dissatisfaction domination by the nobility.

Aside from his opinions towards nobility Sieyès also had a passion for music. He devoted himself assiduously to cultivating music as he had plenty of spare time. Along with cultivating music Sieyes also enjoyed writing reflections concerning these pieces. Sieyès had a collection of musical pieces he called la catalogue de ma petite musique.

Although Sieyès was passionate about his ideologies he had a rather uninvolved social life. His journals and papers held much information about his studies but almost nothing pertaining to his personal life. His associates referred to him as cold and vain. In particular Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord remarked that Men are in his eyes chess-pieces to be moved they occupy his mind but say nothing to his heart."
Jean de Silhon,"Jean de Silhon was a French philosopher and politician. He was a founding member and the first to occupy seat 24 of the Académie française in 1634.

At Cardinal Richelieus prompting he defended the concept of reason of state arguing that the political necessities under which the State operates mean that it need not always follow normal laws of ethics such as telling the truth. Reason of state was thus he said a mean between that which conscience permits and affairs require."
Jules Simon,"Jules François Simon was a French statesman and philosopher and one of the leaders of the Moderate Republicans in the Third French Republic.

Simon was born at Lorient. His father was a linen-draper from Lorraine who renounced Protestantism before his second marriage with a Catholic Breton. Jules Simon was the son of this second marriage. The family name was Suisse which Simon dropped in favour of his third forename. By considerable sacrifice he was enabled to attend a seminary at Vannes and worked briefly as usher in a school before in 1833 he became a student at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. There he came in contact with Victor Cousin who sent him to Caen and then to Versailles to teach philosophy. He helped Cousin without receiving any recognition in his translations from Plato and Aristotle and in 1839 became his deputy in the chair of philosophy at the University of Paris with the meagre salary of 83 francs per month. He also lectured on the history of philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure.

At this period he edited the works of Nicolas Malebranche of René Descartes Bossuet and of Antoine Arnauld and in 18441845 appeared the two volumes of his Histoire de lécole dAlexandrie. He became a regular contributor to the Revue des deux mondes and in 1847 with Amédée Jacques and Émile Saisset founded the Liberté de penser with the intention of throwing off the yoke of Cousin but he retired when Jacques allowed the insertion of an article advocating the principles of collectivism with which he was at no time in sympathy.

In 1848 he represented the Côtes-du-Nord in the National Assembly and next year entered the Council of State but was retired on account of his republican opinions. His refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the government of Louis Napoleon after the coup détat was followed by his dismissal from his professorship and he devoted himself to philosophical and political writings of a popular order. Le Devoir which was translated into modern Greek and Swedish was followed by La Religion naturelle La Liberté de conscience La Liberté politique La Liberté civile LOuvrière LEcole Le Travail LOuvrier de huit ans and others.

In 1863 he was returned to the Corps Législatif for the 8th circonscription of the Seine département and supported les Cinq in their opposition to the government. He became minister of instruction in the Government of National Defense on 5 September 1870. After the capitulation of Paris in January 1871 he was sent down to Bordeaux to prevent the resistance of Léon Gambetta to the peace. But at Bordeaux Gambetta who had issued a proclamation excluding from the elections those who had been officials under the Empire was all-powerful. Pretending to dispute Jules Simons credentials he issued orders for his arrest. Meanwhile Simon had found means of communication with Paris and on 6 February was reinforced by Eugène Pelletan E. Arago and Garnier-Pages. Gambetta resigned and the ministry of the Interior though nominally given to Arago was really in Simons hands.

Defeated in the département of the Seine he sat for the Marne in the National Assembly and resumed the portfolio of Education in the first cabinet of Adolphe Thierss presidency. He advocated free primary education yet sought to conciliate the clergy by all the means in his power; but no concessions removed the hostility of Dupanloup who presided over the commission appointed to consider his draft of an elementary education bill. The reforms he was actually able to carry out were concerned with secondary education. He encouraged the study of living languages and limited the attention given to the making of Latin verse; he also encouraged independent methods at the École Normale and set up a school at Rome where members of the French school of Athens should spend some time.

He retained office until a week before the fall of Thiers in 1873. He was regarded by the monarchical right as one of the most dangerous obstacles in the way of a restoration which he did as much as any man to prevent but by the extreme left he was distrusted for his moderate views and Gambetta never forgave his victory at Bordeaux. In 1875 he became a member of the Académie Française and a life senator and in 1876 on the resignation of Jules Dufaure was summoned to form a cabinet. He replaced anti-republican functionaries in the civil service by republicans and held his own until 3 May 1877 when he adopted a motion carried by a large majority in the Chamber inviting the cabinet to use all means for the repression of clerical agitation.

His clerical enemies then induced Marshal MacMahon to take advantage of a vote on the press law carried in Jules Simons absence from the Chamber to write him a letter regretting that he no longer preserved his influence in the Chamber and thus practically demanding his resignation. His resignation in response to this act of the president known as the Seize Mai which he might have resisted by an appeal to the Chamber proved his ruin and he never again held office. He justified his action by his fear of providing an opportunity for a coup détat on the part of the Marshal. However the May 1877 crisis eventually ended in MacMahons demise and in the victory of the Republicans over the monarchist Orleanists and Legitimists.

The rejection of article 7 of Ferrys Education Act by which the profession of teaching would have been forbidden to members of non-authorized congregations was due to his intervention. He was in fact one of the chief of the left centre Opportunist Republicans faction opposed in the same faction to Jules Grévy and also to the Radical Gambetta. He was director of Le Gaulois from 1879 to 1881 and his influence in the country among moderate republicans was retained by his articles in Le Matin from 1882 onwards in the Journal des Débats which he joined in 1886 and in Le Temps from 1890.

His own accounts of some of the events in which he had been involved appear in Souvenirs du 4 septembre Le Gouvernement de M. Thiers in Mémoires des autres Nouveaux mémoires des autres and Les Derniers mémoires des autres while his sketch of Victor Cousin was a further contribution to contemporary history. For his personal history the Premiers mémoires and Le Soir de ma journée edited by his son Gustave Simon may be supplemented by Léon Séchés Figures bretonnes Jules Simon sa vie son œuvre and Georges Picot Jules Simon notice historique ; also by many references to periodical literature and collected essays in Hugo Paul Thiemes Guide bibliographique de la littérature française de 1800 à 1906 ."
Gilbert Simondon,"Gilbert Simondon was a French philosopher best known for his theory of individuation a major source of inspiration for Gilles Deleuze Bruno Latour and Bernard Stiegler.

Born in Saint-Étienne Simondon was a student of philosopher of science Georges Canguilhem philosopher Martial Guéroult and phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Sorbonne. He defended his doctoral dissertations in 1958 at the University of Paris. His main thesis Lindividuation à la lumière des notions de Forme et dInformation was published in two parts the first in 1964 under the title Lindividu et sa génèse physico-biologique at the Presses Universitaires de France while it is only in 1989 that Aubier published the second part Lindividuation psychique et collective . While his main thesis which laid the foundations of his thinking was not widely read until it was commented upon by Gilles Deleuze and more recently Bruno Latour and Bernard Stiegler his complementary thesis Du mode dexistence des objets techniques was published by Aubier immediately after being completed and had an instant impact on a wide audience. It was only in 2005 that Jérôme Millon published a complete edition of the main thesis.

In Lindividuation psychique et collective Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than as a cause. Thus the individual atom is replaced by the never-ending process of individuation. Simondon also conceived of pre-individual fields as the resources making individuation itself possible. Individuation is an always incomplete process always leaving a pre-individual left-over itself making possible future individuations. Furthermore psychic individuation always creates both an individual and a collective subject which individuate themselves together. Simondon criticized Norbert Wieners theory of cybernetics arguing that Right from the start Cybernetics has accepted what all theory of technology must refuse a classification of technological objects conducted by means of established criteria and following genera and species. Simondon aimed to overcome the shortcomings of cybernetics by developing a general phenomenology of machines.

Simondons theory of individuation through transduction in a metastable environment was an important influence on the thought of Gilles Deleuze whose Différence et répétition Logique du sens and Lîle déserte make explicit reference to Simondons work. Gilbert Simondon une pensée de lindividuation et de la technique the proceedings of the first conference devoted to Simondons work further charts his influence on such thinkers as François Laruelle Gilles Châtelet Anne Fagot-Largeau Yves Deforge René Thom and Bernard Stiegler . Another contributor to Gilbert Simondon une pensée de lindividuation et de la technique Simondons friend John Hart was the instigator of the very first translationfrom French into English c.1980of Simondons work . Currently Simondon can be seen as a major influence on the work of such scholars as Paolo Virno Jean-Hugues Barthélémy Thierry Bardini Luciana Parisi Brian Massumi Adrian Mackenzie Muriel Combes Carl Mitcham Andrew Feenberg Yuk Hui Isabelle Stengers Thomas LaMarre Bruno Latour and Anne Sauvagnargues.

FilmsFrançois Lagarde and Pascal Chabot have made a movie on Simondon Simondon of the Desert with Anne Fagot-Largeault Arne De Boever Dominique Lecourt Gilbert Hottois Giovanni Carrozzini Jean-Hugues Barthélémy Jean Clottes and music by Jean-Luc Guillonet."
Jean Soldini,"Jean Soldini is a Swiss and French philosopher art historian and poet.

He studied in Paris where he earned the Habilitation à diriger des recherches after he graduated with a Ph.D. in philosophy and with a preceding Ph.D. in history of architecture.

His studies are aimed to build a non-authoritarian metaphysics where aesthetics of hospitality plays a primary role within knowledge looking for the possibility of a resistance against the annihilation of the Other. A resistance against the arrogance of any kind of authoritarian thinking with its multiform camouflages with its never-ending threat against what is existing-with-other. The aesthetics of hospitality does not be confused with an aestheticization of hospitality. It is a philosophy involved to reflect on sensation through what has its focus on the senses to donate and receive food water a roof for sleeping.Soldini is also author of essays on Alberto Giacometti on the philosophical margins of a creative work that put into effect the vital desire to know radically."
Samuel de Sorbiere,"Samuel Sorbière was a French physician and man of letters a philosopher and translator who is best known for his promotion of the works of Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi in whose view of physics he placed his support though unable to refute René Descartes but who developed a reputation in his own day for a truculent and disputatious nature. Sorbière is regarded often by his position on ethics and disclosure about medical mistakes. In 1672 Sorbière considered the idea of being honest and upfront about a mistake having been made in medicine but thought that it might seriously jeopardise medical practice and concluded that it would not catch on.

After relocating to the Netherlands he published a French translation of Thomas Mores Utopia in 1643. He arranged for the publication of Hobbess De Cive in Amsterdam in 1647 published a French translation in 1649 published a French translation of Hobbes De Corpore Politico or the Elements of Law in 1652 and helped secure a publisher for Hobbess own Latin translation of Leviathan in 1668. His collected Lettres et discours de M. de Sorbière sur diverses matières curieuses published in Paris 1660 are imbued with the spirit of compromise reconciling science and theology and separating science from metaphysics. His life of Gassendi was prefixed to the collected edition of Gassendis writings 1658. Besides Gassendi and Hobbes he corresponded with Marin Mersenne François de La Mothe Le Vayer and other prominent thinkers of the day.

In 16631664 Sorbière visited England where in 1663 he was inducted into the Royal Society. In 1664 he published an account of his stay Relation dun voyage en Angleterre où sont touchées plusieurs choses qui regardent lestat des sciences et de la religion in which he offered his comments on how bad the food was how bad the inns were and imputed to the Royal Society the intention of developing a library. This provoked Thomas Sprat to publish Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbiers Voyage into England as a reply to Sorbières perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy Sorbière was held under arrest for four months in France and Charles II of England prohibited any further responses.

Sorbières conversion from Calvinism to Catholicism which opened a career to him has been interpreted in a political light."
Georges Sorel,"Georges Eugène Sorel was a French social thinker political theorist historian and later journalist. He has inspired theories and movements grouped under the name of Sorelianism. His social and political philosophy owed much to his reading of Proudhon Karl Marx Giambattista Vico Henri Bergson and later William James. His notion of the power of myth in collective agency inspired socialists anarchists Marxists and fascists. Together with his defense of violence it is the contribution for which he is most often remembered.

Politically he evolved from his early liberal-conservative positions towards Marxism social-democracy and eventually syndicalism. Between 1909 and 1910 he was marginally involved with Charles Maurras Action Française and between 1911 and 1913 he wrote for the politically transversal LIndépendance established together with Edouard Berth one of Sorels main disciples and Georges Valois closer to Maurrassian circles. After a long silence during the war Sorel came out in favour of Lenin and moved towards Bolshevist positions until his death in 1922.

His legacy in the interwar period embraced both ends of the political spectrum as many former syndicalists welcomed the emerging fascism. According to historian Zeev Sternhell Sorels revision of Marxism broke the necessity of the link between revolution and working class opening up the possibility of replacing the proletariat with the national community.

Born in Cherbourg as the son of a businessman he moved to Paris in 1864 to attend the Collège Rollin before entering the École Polytechnique a year later. In 1869 he became chief engineer with the Department of Public Works. Stationed in Corsica until June 1871 he was subsequently posted to various places in southern France - Albi Gap and Draguignan. Between 1876 and 1879 he was in Mostaganem in colonial Algeria before moving to Perpignan where he spent the last years of his career until his retirement in 1892. In 1891 he was awarded the Légion dhonneur. Immediately after retiring he moved with his partner Marie David to Boulogne-sur-Seine near Paris where he stayed until his death in 1922.

Beginning in the second half of the 1880s he published articles in various fields displaying the influence of Aristotle as well as those of Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. In 1893 he publicly announced his position as a Marxist and a socialist. He moved to working on some of Frances first Marxist journals and to participating on the revisionist side in the debate launched by Eduard Bernstein. A supporter of Dreyfus during the affaire Sorel later was disappointed much like his friend Charles Péguy by the political consequences of the trial. 

In the beginning of the 20th century he began arguing for the incompatibility between socialism and parliamentary democracy moving towards syndicalist positions. Through his writings in Enrico Leones Il Divenire sociale and Hubert Lagardelles Mouvement socialiste he contributed around 1905 to the theoretical elaboration of revolutionary syndicalism. In 1905 his most famous text Reflections on Violence began appearing in the Divenire Sociale. It was published in book form in 1908 by Pages Libres and was followed the same year by Illusions du Progrès.

In the wake of the 1909 defeat of the syndicalist wing of the Confédération Générale du Travail Sorel became close for a period in 19091910 with Charles Maurras Action française while sharing neither its nationalism nor its political program. This collaboration inspired the founders of the Cercle Proudhon which brought together revolutionary syndicalists and monarchists. Sorel himself with Jean Variot founded a journal in 1911 called LIndépendance although disagreements in part over nationalism soon ended the project. Sorel also collaborated with Italian revolutionaries and published articles in La Lupa a weekly magazine founded by Paolo Orano where he began to adopt the concept of proletarian nation developed by Enrico Corradini.

Ferociously opposed to the 1914 Union sacrée political truce Sorel denounced the war and in 1917 praised the Russian Revolution. He was in print for an official Soviet Union publication Russian Soviet Government Bureau calling Lenin the greatest theoretician of socialism since Marx and a statesman whose genius recalls that of Peter the Great. He wrote numerous small pieces for Italian newspapers defending the Bolsheviks. Whereas Sorels support for Bolshevism is a matter of abundant public record his much-talked-about interest in the newborn fascist movement is only confirmed by nationalist sources from the interwar period. According to the Maurrassian intellectual Jean Variot in March 1921 Sorel confided to him that Mussolini is a man no less extraordinary than Lenin. He too is a political genius of a greater reach than all the statesmen of the day with the only exception of Lenin

Though Sorel engaged with Marxism for virtually every one of his years as an active intellectual his belonging to the Marxist tradition is contested. Often associated with an heroic apocalyptic and ultimately aesthetic Marxism Sorel is by some thought more as a thinker of decadence. Nonetheless analysis of his engagement with Marx show him to be preoccupied more with the epistemological subtleties of historical materialism than with an impending moral collapse. Absorbing the twin influences of Henri Bergson and Italian idealists Sorel elaborated a Marxism rejecting economic and historical determinism and seeing itself not as social science but as an historically-situated ideology.

Though Sorel had been a moderate conservative before turning to Marxism in the 1890s his interest in the doctrine was dictated by scientific more than by political motivations. In a context in which Marxs work remained relatively unknown and obscure Sorel sought to develop the theory in order to prove that as he wrote to Benedetto Croce in 1895 socialism is worthy of belonging to the modern scientific movement. This involved rejecting the standard French objections to Marxism historical and economic determinism.

While until 1900 he had believed that this path of institutional development was best served through political engagement in parliamentary democracy his ideas changed in the beginning of the century. Partly in reaction to the republican triumph in the 1902 French elections and partly in virtue of new analyses on the emergence of welfare capitalism he now believed that prolonged involvement in bourgeois parliamentarism would spell the death of the revolutionary working class. He thus elaborated a change of strategy linked to the new circumstances. Since class is not produced by the evolution of capitalist economy then a sustained practice of highly ideologically-charged social conflict - the grève prolétarienne - can maybe restore the conditions ideal for a revolutionary working class to thrive. As he explained in the Reflections on Violence

Generally seen as a representative of fin de siècle irrationalism Sorels epistemological thinking is more accurately characterized as anti-positivist and increasingly moving towards a proto-pragmatist position. 

Though always extremely critical of mechanistic explanations and conflicted over the implications of deterministic approaches Sorel until the mid-1890s was a scientific realist. As such he argued against a conventionalist reading of the implications of non-Euclidean geometries suggesting that geometry is an empirical and cumulative science. His early epistemological thought can be seen as an attempt to balance this scientific realism with the doubts over determinism and the desire to vindicate human agency. This act of balancing was achieved in his 1894 Ancienne et Nouvelle Métaphysique. In this text Sorel established a dualism between a deterministic natural milieu and an essentially free artificial milieu. Science belongs to the latter and its history testifies it all the numerous conceptual and material tools developed by scientists to enquire upon nature all the changes that occurred in the history of science demonstrate the human creativity and historical situatedness which lie at the heart of science. Drawing upon Henri Bergsons Time and Free Will he elaborated a theory of human freedom not as exemption from natural determinism but as creative capacity We are free in the sense that we can construct tools that have no model in the cosmic environment; we do not alter the laws of nature but we are capable of creating sequences whose ordering is our decision

At the same time however experimental practice provided to science an anchoring into the deterministic cosmic milieu and hence could safeguard scientific realism. Experiments for Sorel do not correspond to natural conditions of observation they are highly constructed observational settings which nonetheless allow a contact with nature and thus are suitable for the construction of predictive laws. Industrial practice is the initial setting of this experimental activity which then moves on to greater refinement and abstraction in scientific laboratories. Through this conceptualisation of the experimental nature of science Sorel can thus avoid the conventionalist implications to which his theory of the artificial milieu push him I did not only say that science is social; for one could conclude that I give the name of science to a number of widespread prejudices held by everyone; I have no intention of going back to the old mistake of universal consensus.

This dualistic framework resisted until Sorel attempted to tackle the epistemological issues of the human and social sciences. As long as laws could be extracted from the deterministic natural milieu Sorels scientific realism was safe. But as soon as the problem of a science of society confronted him the tensions in his epistemology reached breaking point given that such a science must by definition be the science of the artificial creatively constructed realm how will it be possible to extract laws from such an unpredictable environment Sorels initial answer is to look for pockets of deterministic behaviour inside of the social world. Thus in his 1892 essay on Proudhon and the science of economics Sorel argues that while individual labour is scientifically imponderable it assumes regular law-like behaviour when taken collectively and commends Proudhon for making this point ...in the notion of value Proudhon gets rid of all these anti-scientific elements products are classified not according to fancies and individual claims but according to their position in social production. He however began to express increasing uneasiness about these deterministic solutions. In his review of Émile Durkheims Rules of Sociological Method he expressed serious reservations about idealtypic and statistical reasonings in the social sciences arguing that what is striking in the human milieu is that which is human that is to say action considered from the perspective of the agent.

To capture this collective agency in a social scientific way Sorel had to abandon his notion of scientific explanation in terms of deterministic laws. That he could do thanks to the reading of the work of Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico whose epistemology of verum ipsum factum allowed Sorel to develop an alternative account of what a scientific explanation consists in. Instead of highlighting a deterministic causal nexus explanations in the social sciences would now be concerned with accounting for how a creative agent produces. As Sorel noted this furnishes the epistemological grounding on which a social scientific enterprise can stand provided that it renounces notions of atemporal laws of historical development and it focuses instead on the situated contextual explanation of human collective agency. 

Thus ideal history has perished overcome by the development of historical research. It is now nothing but a memory... In natural science as well there is a similar sort of problem that contemporary philosophy has shown itself equally powerless to resolve. Critique of the idea of divinity has shaken the foundations of all knowledge that drew its certitude from the ancient idea of God in nature. Science no longer seems today safe from contingency the fixed point has disappeared. It is enough to read the titles of contemporary theses on understanding and contingency to understand how it preoccupies reflective minds. Neither does it seem easy to respond to those who want to know where law finds its place in materialist conceptions of history. The difficulty is the same as above law that is immutable and rests in the divine Idea has disappeared as has science possessed totally by God. Nothing is served by denying the difficulties that result from these new principles but this is not a reason to revive famously incorrect doctrines. 

By the end of the first decade of the century Sorel encounters American pragmatism which he initially looked to with suspicion. In the first edition of his Illusions of Progress he calls pragmatism the last term of bourgeois philosophy adding that its popularity was due to its flexibility its garrulousness and the cynicism of its success. Soon enough however a more in-depth acquaintance with the work of William James changed Sorels opinion. He started calling himself a pragmatist and tried to remedy some of the relativistic consequences of James theory of truth. His last major work in the philosophy of science was called the Utility of Pragmatism. In it Sorel sketched a theory of knowledge as always and irredemably situated going close to denying the possibility of knowledge of the natural milieu. "
Marc Soriano,"Marc Soriano was a 20th-century French philosopher.

After the death of his father his family went to Italy. He stayed in Pisa between 1921 and 1927 then came to live in Paris. A pupil at Lycée Condorcet in Paris he was the only khâgneux received at the École Normale Supérieure in 1939 but his name is not on the directories. Mobilized in 1939 wounded in April 1940 he joined the Résistance in 1942. He was received in the first place at the December special session of the Aggregation of Philosophy Competition of 1945. For some time he followed the seminars of Pierre-Maxime Schuhl at the Sorbonne and then worked in Geneva with Jean Piaget. He specialized in tales especially those of Charles Perrault. Suffering from myasthenia gravis since 1978 which had caused him to lose the use of speech he died 18 December 1994.

A laureate of the Prix Sainte-Beuve in 1968 for his study les Contes de Perrault culture savante et tradition populaire the Académie française also bestowed him her Prix dAcadémie in 1991 for all his work.

He was violinist Denise Soriano-Boucherits brother."
Étienne Souriau,Son of Paul Souriau he studied at the École Normale Supérieure and received his agrégation of philosophy in 1925. After teaching at the universities of Aix-en-Provence and Lyon he eventually became a professor at the Sorbonne where he held a chair in aesthetics. He was the editor of the Revue desthétique and was elected to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in 1958. Recently the works of Bruno Latour have reawoken interests on Souriaus oeuvre specially his works on ontology and metaphysics regarding his theories of different modes of existence.
Albert Spaier,"Albert Spaier was a French philosopher professor of philosophy at the University of Caen.

Albert Spaier was born in Iași Romania. Studying at the Sorbonne he volunteered to fight for the French at the outset of World War I and became a French citizen soon afterwards. He became a professor at Caen in 1927.

Spaier helped found the Recherches philosophiques editing its philosophy of science section until his death. He died prematurely on 5 February 1934."
George Steiner,"Francis George SteinerFBA was a Franco-American literary critic essayist philosopher novelist and educator. He wrote extensively about the relationship between language literature and society and the impact of the Holocaust. An article in The Guardian described Steiner as a polyglot and polymath.

Among his admirers Steiner is ranked among the great minds in todays literary world. English novelist A. S. Byatt described him as a late late late Renaissance man ... a European metaphysician with an instinct for the driving ideas of our time. Harriet Harvey-Wood a former literature director of the British Council described him as a magnificent lecturer prophetic and doom-laden turn up with half a page of scribbled notes and never refer to them.

Steiner was Professor of English and Comparative Literature in the University of Geneva Professor of Comparative Literature and Fellow in the University of Oxford Professor of Poetry in Harvard University and an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College Cambridge.

George Steiner was born in 1929 in Paris to Viennese Jewish parents Else and Frederick Georg Steiner. He had an elder sister Ruth Lilian who was born in Vienna in 1922. Frederick Steiner was a senior lawyer at Austrias central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank and Else Steiner was a Viennese grande dame.

Five years before Steiners birth his father had moved his family from Austria to France to escape the growing threat of anti-Semitism. He believed that Jews were endangered guests wherever they went and equipped his children with languages. Steiner grew up with three mother tongues German English and French; his mother was multilingual and would often begin a sentence in one language and end it in another.

When he was six years old his father who believed in the importance of classical education taught him to read the Iliad in the original Greek. His mother for whom self-pity was nauseating helped Steiner overcome a handicap he had been born with a withered right arm. Instead of allowing him to become left-handed she insisted he use his right hand as an able-bodied person would.

Steiners first formal education took place at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in Paris. In 1940 during World War II Steiners father once again relocated his family this time to New York City. Within a month of their move the Nazis occupied Paris and of the many Jewish children in Steiners class at school he was one of only two who survived the war. Again his fathers insight had saved his family and this made Steiner feel like a survivor which profoundly influenced his later writings. My whole life has been about death remembering and the Holocaust. Steiner became a grateful wanderer saying that Trees have roots and I have legs; I owe my life to that. He spent the rest of his school years at the Lycée Français de New York in Manhattan and became a United States citizen in 1944.

After high school Steiner went to the University of Chicago where he studied literature as well as mathematics and physics and obtained a BA degree in 1948. This was followed by an MA degree from Harvard University in 1950. He thence attended Balliol College Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship.

After his doctoral thesis at Oxford a draft of The Death of Tragedy was rejected Steiner took time off from his studies to teach English at Williams College and to work as leader writer for the London-based weekly publication The Economist between 1952 and 1956. It was during this time that he met Zara Shakow a New Yorker of Lithuanian descent. She had also studied at Harvard and they met in London at the suggestion of their former professors. The professors had had a bet ... that we would get married if we ever met. They married in 1955 the year he received his DPhil from Oxford University. They have a son David Steiner and a daughter Deborah Steiner . He last lived in Cambridge England. Zara Steiner died on 13 February 2020 ten days after her husband.

In 1956 Steiner returned to the United States where for two years he was a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey. He also held a Fulbright professorship in Innsbruck Austria from 1958 to 1959. In 1959 he was appointed Gauss Lecturer at Princeton where he lectured for another two years. He then became a founding fellow of Churchill College Cambridge in 1961. Steiner was initially not well received at Cambridge by the English faculty. Some disapproved of this charismatic firebrand with a foreign accent and questioned the relevance of the Holocaust he constantly referred to in his lectures. Bryan Cheyette professor of 20th-century literature at the University of Southampton said that at the time Britain didnt think it had a relationship to the Holocaust; its mythology of the war was rooted in the Blitz Dunkirk the Battle of Britain. While Steiner received a professorial salary he was never made a full professor at Cambridge with the right to examine. He had the option of leaving for professorships in the United States but Steiners father objected saying that Hitler who said no one bearing their name would be left in Europe would then have won. Steiner remained in England because Id do anything rather than face such contempt from my father. He was elected an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College in 1969.

After several years as a freelance writer and occasional lecturer Steiner accepted the post of Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva in 1974; he held this post for 20 years teaching in four languages. He lived by Goethes maxim that no monoglot truly knows his own language. He became Professor Emeritus in the University of Geneva upon his retirement in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College Oxford in 1995. He also held the positions of the first Lord Weidenfeld Professor of Comparative European Literature and Fellow of St Annes College Oxford from 1994 to 1995 and Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University from 2001 to 2002.

Steiner was called an intelligent and intellectual critic and essayist. He was active on undergraduate publications while at the University of Chicago and later became a regular contributor of reviews and articles to many journals and newspapers including The Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian. He wrote for The New Yorker for over thirty years contributing over two hundred reviews.

While Steiner generally took things very seriously he also revealed an unexpected deadpan humor when he was once asked if he had ever read anything trivial as a child he replied Moby-Dick.

Steiner was regarded as a polymath and is often credited with having recast the role of the critic by having explored art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. He advocated generalisation over specialisation and insisted that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences. Steiner believed that nationalism is too inherently violent to satisfy the moral prerogative of Judaism having said that because of what we are there are things we cant do.

Among Steiners non-traditional views in his autobiography titled Errata Steiner related his sympathetic stance towards the use of brothels since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner stated My virginity offended Alfie . He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He sniffed the fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero Illinois a town justly ill famed but by virtue of its name reassuring to me. There he organized with casual authority an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass that blesses me still.

Central to Steiners thinking he stated is my astonishment naïve as it seems to people that you can use human speech both to love to build to forgive and also to torture to hate to destroy and to annihilate.

Steiner received criticism and support for his views that racism is inherent in everyone and that tolerance is only skin deep. He is reported to have said Its very easy to sit here in this room and say racism is horrible. But ask me the same thing if a Jamaican family moved next door with six children and they play reggae and rock music all day. Or if an estate agent comes to my house and tells me that because a Jamaican family has moved next door the value of my property has fallen through the floor. Ask me then

Steiners literary career spanned half a century. He published original essays and books that address the anomalies of contemporary Western culture issues of language and its debasement in the post-Holocaust age. His field was primarily comparative literature and his work as a critic tended toward exploring cultural and philosophical issues particularly dealing with translation and the nature of language and literature.

Steiners first published book was Tolstoy or Dostoevsky An Essay in Contrast which was a study of the different ideas and ideologies of the Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky. The Death of Tragedy originated as his doctoral thesis at the University of Oxford and examined literature from the ancient Greeks to the mid-20th century. His best-known book After Babel was an early and influential contribution to the field of translation studies. It was adapted for television as The Tongues of Men and was the inspiration behind the creation in 1983 of the English avant-rock group News from Babel.

Works of literary fiction by Steiner include four short story collections Anno Domini Three Stories Proofs and Three Parables The Deeps of the Sea and A cinq heures de laprès-midi ; and his controversialnovella The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. . Portage to San Cristobal in which Jewish Nazi hunters find Adolf Hitler alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II explored ideas about the origins of European anti-semitism first expounded by Steiner in his critical work In Bluebeards Castle . Steiner has suggested that Nazism was Europes revenge on the Jews for inventing conscience. Cheyette sees Steiners fiction as an exploratory space where he can think against himself. It contrasts its humility and openness with his increasingly closed and orthodox critical work. Central to it is the survivors terrible masochistic envy about not being there having missed the rendezvous with hell.

No Passion Spent is a collection of essays on topics as diverse as Kierkegaard Homer in translation Biblical texts and Freuds dream theory. Errata An Examined Life is a semi-autobiography and Grammars of Creation based on Steiners 1990 Gifford Lectures delivered at the University of Glasgow explores a range of subjects from cosmology to poetry.

He has also won numerous awards for his fiction and poetry including"
Bernard Stiegler,"Bernard Stiegler was a French philosopher. He was head of the Institut de recherche et dinnovation which he founded in 2006 at the Centre Georges-Pompidou. He was also the founder in 2005 of the political and cultural group Ars Industrialis; the founder in 2010 of the philosophy school pharmakon.fr held at Épineuil-le-Fleuriel; and a co-founder in 2018 of Collectif Internation a group of politicised researchers across multiple disciplines. His best known work is Technics and Time 1 The Fault of Epimetheus.

Stiegler has been described as one of the most influential European philosophers of the 21st century and an important theorist of the effects of digital technology.

Stieglers work is influenced by among others Sigmund Freud André Leroi-Gourhan Gilbert Simondon Friedrich Nietzsche Paul Valéry Edmund Husserl Martin Heidegger Karl Marx Gilles Deleuze Donald Winnicott Georges Bataille and Jacques Derrida.

Key themes are technology time individuation consumerism consumer capitalism technological convergence digitization Americanization education and the future of politics and human society.

Between 1978 and 1983 Stiegler was incarcerated for armed robbery first at the Prison Saint-Michel in Toulouse and then at the Centre de détention in Muret. It was during this period that he became interested in philosophy studying it by correspondence with Gérard Granel at the Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail. His transformation in prison is recounted in his book Passer à lacte .

In 198788 with Catherine Counot Stiegler commissioned an exhibition at the Centre Georges-Pompidou entitled Mémoires du futur bibliothèques et technologies. Stiegler earned his doctorate from the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in 1993. He has been a Director at the Collège international de philosophie and a Professor at the Université de Technologie at Compiègne as well as a visiting professor at Goldsmiths University of London. He has held the positions of Director General at the Institut National de lAudiovisuel and Director General at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination AcoustiqueMusique .

On 1 January 2006 he commenced as Director of the Department of Cultural Development at the Centre Georges-Pompidou. He was Director of the Institut de recherche et dinnovation which was created at his initiative in April 2006.

Stiegler has been prolifically publishing books articles and interviews since 1994. His works include several ongoing series of books

On 18 June 2005 Stiegler founded a political and cultural group Ars Industrialis the manifesto of which calls for an industrial politics of spirit. The manifesto was signed by Stiegler and the other co-founders of the group George Collins Marc Crépon Catherine Perret and Caroline Stiegler. An updated manifesto was released in 2010.

On 18 September 2010 Stiegler opened his own philosophy school in the small French town of Épineuil-le-Fleuriel in the department of Cher. The school runs a course for lycée students in the region a doctoral program conducted by videoconference and a summer academy that involves both groups of students as well as interested inhabitants from the surrounding area. The context and themes of the school lie in Stieglers argument that we are entering a period of post-consumerism and post-globalization. At a philosophical level the school is engaged in research critique and analysis in line with Stieglers pharmacological approach.

Stiegler features prominently in a number of works of film and television and has appeared on French television numerous times. Among his most significant appearances are the following

Stieglers daughter Barbara is also a philosopher. She attended the École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-St-Cloud and in 2003 obtained her doctorate from the University of Paris IV Paris-Sorbonne. Barbara Stiegler is the author of Nietzsche et la biologie Nietzsche et la critique de la chair Dionysos Ariane le Christ Il faut sadapter Sur un nouvel impératif politique Du cap aux grèves. Récit dune mobilisation. 17 novembre 2018 - 5 mars 2020 and De la démocratie en Pandémie; santé recherche éducation . She is not to be confused with the German sociologist of the same name."
Michel Surya,Michel Surya is a French writer philosopher and publisher. A specialist of Georges Bataille he is the founder and director of the journal Lignes.
Peter Szendy,"Peter Szendy is a French philosopher and musicologist. He is the David Herlihy Professor of Humanities and Comparative Literature at Brown University.

His Écoute une histoire de nos oreilles is a critique of Romantic and Modernist conceptions of listening. Paying close attention to arrangements as signed listenings and to the juridical history of the listener Szendy suggests an alternative model based on deconstruction listening he argues is a tolerated theft and our ears are always already haunted by the ear of the other.

In Sur écoute. Esthétique de lespionnage he draws on Foucaults analysis of the Panopticon and Deleuzes Postscript on the Societies of Control in order to show how the act of listening always entails issues of power and dominion. Sur écoute proposes an archeology of overhearing following many paths from the Bible to spy movies like Hitchcocks Torn Curtain or Coppolas The Conversation.

In Membres fantômes des corps musiciens Szendy rethinks the concept of body as construed in the history of Western musical thought and sketches the outlines of a general organology based on the rhetorical concept of effiction. In his book on Moby Dick he develops a theory of reading as prophecy while reassessing Derridas famous sentence il ny a pas de hors-texte.

Hits Philosophy in the jukebox analyzes haunting melodies as powerful articulations or jointings between the psyche and the global market. Globalization becomes the key motive of Kant chez les extraterrestres philosofictions cosmopolitiques a reading of Carl Schmitt and Kant that follows the trail of extraterrestrial presence in many of the philosophers major works . The specifically cosmopolitical dimension of mankind in Kant Szendy argues does not reside in the traditional vertical definitions that locate man between the beast and the divine but in the horizontal comparison that projects him in outer space.

Kant chez les extraterrestres draws on the two meanings of the Greek word kosmos oscillating between cosmetics and cosmopolitics. In his latest book Lapocalypse-cinéma. 2012 et autres fins du monde Szendy develops his reflections on the concept of world into a theory of film as a cineworld always exposed to its radical finitude."
Pierre-André Taguieff,"Pierre-André Taguieff is a French philosopher who has specialised in the study of racism and antisemitism. He is the director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in an Institut dEtudes Politiques de Paris laboratory the Centre for Political Research . He is also a member of the Cercle de lOratoire think tank.

Taguieff is the author of a number of books and papers on racism and antisemitism including The Force of Prejudice On Racism and Its Doubles and Rising from the Muck The New Antisemitism in Europe . He is known in particular for his studies on the French National Front and populism.

In La Force du préjugé essai sur le racisme et ses doubles Taguieff analyzed several different types of racism

Taguieff was himself accused of racism on several occasions for instance when he praised Oriana Fallacis book The Rage and the Pride. He was also criticized for his contribution to the controversial website Dreuz info which French newspaper Le Monde described as ultra zionist and islamophobic.

According to Taguieff racist discourse such as that supported by Alain de Benoists Nouvelle Droite far-right movement has accepted the theories of cultural relativism and the non-existence of biological race. Claiming to uphold cultural relativism and thus antiracism this new racist discourse in fact reiterates the strict distinction of various ethnic groups and segregation between them.

Since it argues that ethnic groups exist but are not biological races it claims not to be racist. However apart from the pseudo-scientific racist theories of the 19th century it espouses an anti-assimilationist point of view in completely rejecting the notion of a social melting pot. Arguing that the Enlightenments philosophy of universality taken to extremes is a form of racism it pretends to be antiracist by preaching strict separation of ethnic groups. However if the critics of universal racism are correct it is clear that this new form of racism is descended in a direct line from the old discourse of separation between different supposed races.

Taguieff is also very interested in the work of Leon Poliakov and Norman Cohn and has worked a great deal on the antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Today he works on nationalism the future of the Republic and the concept of progress.

Pierre-André Taguieffs denunciation of antisemitism and of the instrumentalisation of anti-Zionism by specific ultra-minority groups has caused controversy his opponents claiming that he was identifying anti-Zionism with antisemitism. However Pierre-André Taguieff is a staunch opponent of any form of communitarianism whatsoever. As such he does not claim that anti-Zionism is necessarily antisemitism but simply that in some Islamist circles explicit anti-Zionism may dissimulate implicit antisemitism in the pure tradition of the European history of antisemitism.

Despite its contrast to conservatism Pierre-André Taguieff wrote Les Contre-réactionnaires in 2007 in which he opposed both antiracism and antifascism. He considers them as ideologies which are instrumentalized by far-left groups aiming to regularize as many illegal immigrants as possible without any regulation."
Hippolyte Taine,"Hippolyte Adolphe Taine was a French critic and historian. He was the chief theoretical influence of French naturalism a major proponent of sociological positivism and one of the first practitioners of historicist criticism. Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him. Taine is also remembered for his attempts to provide a scientific account of literature.

Taine had a profound effect on French literature; the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica asserted that the tone which pervades the works of Zola Bourget and Maupassant can be immediately attributed to the influence we call Taines. Through his work on the French Revolution Taine has been credited as having forged the architectural structure of modern French right-wing historiography.

Taine was born in Vouziers into a fairly prosperous Ardennes family. His father a lawyer his uncle and his grandfather encouraged him to read eclectically and offered him art and music lessons.

In 1841 Taine then aged 13 lost his father and was sent to a boarding school in Paris in the Institution Mathé whose classes were conducted in the Collège Bourbon located in the Batignolles district. He excelled in his studies and in 1847 obtained two Baccalauréat degrees and received the honorary prize of the concours. He was awarded a first in the entrance examination of the letters section of the École Normale Supérieure to which he was admitted in November 1848. Among the 24 students in the letters section he is the classmate of Francisque Sarcey painted a portrait of young Hippolyte at the Rue dUlm campus and Edmond About. But his attitudehe had a reputation for stubbornnessand his intellectual independence from then fashionable ideas embodied by Victor Cousincaused him to fail the examination for the national Concours dAgrégation in philosophy in 1851. After his essay on sensation was rejected he abandoned the social sciences and turned to literature. Having relocated to Province he took up teaching positions in Nevers and Poitiers during which time he continued his intellectual development. In 1853 he obtained a doctorate at the Sorbonne. His thesis Essai sur les fables de La Fontaine which would be later published in revised form in 1861. His subsequent Essay on Livy won a prize from the Académie française in 1854.

Taine adopted the positivist and scientist ideas that emerged around this time.

After defending his doctorate he was automatically transferred to Besançon but he refused this assignment. He settled first in Paris where he enrolled in the medical school. From there he went on a medical cure in the Pyrenees in 1855 after which he wrote his famous Voyage aux Pyrénées and began contributing numerous philosophical literary and historical articles to the Revue des deux Mondes and the Journal des débats two major newspapers at the time.

He then took leave and travelled to England where he spent six weeks. In 1863 he published his History of English Literature in Five Volumes. Bishop Félix Dupanloup who had made it his career to oppose the election of agnostic intellectuals to the French Academy opposed the latters awarding Taine a prize for this work.In 1868 he married Thérèse Denuelle daughter of Alexandre Denuelle. They had two children Geneviève wife of Louis Paul-Dubois and Émile.

The immense success of his work allowed him not only to live by his pen but also to be named professor of the History of Art and Aesthetics at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and professor of history and German at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He also taught at Oxford where he was a Doctor in Law. In 1878 he was elected member of the French Academy by 20 out of the 26 voters.Taine was interested in many subjects including art literature but especially history. Deeply shaken by the defeat of 1870 as well as by the insurrection of the Paris Commune Taine became fully devoted to his major historical work The Origins of Contemporary France on which he worked until his death and which had a significant impact. Conceived by Taine with the aim of understanding the France of his day the six-volume work achieved originality in its use of a long perspective to analyse the causes of the French Revolution. In particular Taine denounced the artificiality of the revolutions political constructions which in his mind violently contradicted the natural and slow growth of the institutions of a State.

In 1885 while visiting the Hospital de la Salpêtriere Taine and Joseph Delboeuf attended a session of hypnotism in which Jean-Martin Charcot experienced vesications by suggestion.

Taine died on 5 March 1893. He was buried in the Roc de Chère National Natural Reserve Talloires on the shores of Lake Annecy. Taine had bought the Boringes property in Menthon-Saint-Bernard in order to work there every summer and had served as councillor of the commune.

Taines writing on the Revolution was and remains popular in France. While admired by liberals like Anatole France it has served to inform the conservative view of the Revolution since Taine rejected its principles as well as the French Constitution of 1793 on account of their being dishonestly presented to the people. He argued that the Jacobins had responded to the centralisation of the ancien régime with even greater centralisation and favoured the individualism of his concepts of regionalism and nation. Taines alternative to rationalist liberalism influenced the social policies of the Third Republic.

On the other hand Taine has likewise received criticism from both sides of the political spectrum his politics being idiosyncratic complex and difficult to define. Among others attacks came from the Marxist historian George Rudé a specialist in the French Revolution and in history from below on account of Taines view of the crowd; and from the Freudian Peter Gay who described Taines reaction to the Jacobins as stigmatisation. Yet Alfred Cobban who advocated a revisionist view of the French Revolution in opposition to the orthodox Marxist school considered Taines account of the French Revolution a brilliant polemic. Taines vision of the Revolution stands in contrast to the Marxist interpretations that gained prominence in the 20th century as was embodied by Albert Mathiez Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul before Alfred Cobban and François Furet put forth their respective revisionist accounts.

Notwithstanding academic politics when Alphonse Aulard a historian of the French Revolution analysed Taines text he showed that the numerous facts and examples presented by Taine to support his account proved substantially correct; few errors were found by Aulardfewer than in his own texts as reported by Augustin Cochin.

In his other writings Taine is known for his attempt to provide a scientific account of literature a project that has led him to be linked to sociological positivists although there were important differences. In his view the work of literature was the product of the authors environment and an analysis of that environment could yield a perfect understanding of that work; this stands in contrast with the view that the work of literature is the spontaneous creation of genius. Taine based his analysis on the categories of what in English would be translated today as nation environment or situation and time.Armin Koller has written that in this Taine drew heavily from the philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder although this has been insufficiently recognised while the Spanish writer Emilia Pardo Bazán has suggested that a crucial predecessor to Taines idea was Germaine de Staëls work on the relationship between art and society. Nationalist literary movements and post-modern critics alike have made use of Taines concepts the former to argue for their unique and distinct place in literature and the latter to deconstruct the texts with regards to the relationship between literature and social history.

Taine was criticised including by Émile Zola for not taking sufficiently into account the individuality of the artist. Zola argued that an artists temperament could lead him to make unique artistic choices distinct from the environment that shaped him and gave Édouard Manet as a principal example. Édouard Lanson argued that Taines environmentalist methodology could not on its own account for genius.

Taines influence on French intellectual culture and literature was significant. He had a special relationship in particular with Émile Zola. As critic Philip Walker says of Zola In page after page including many of his most memorable writings we are presented with what amounts to a mimesis of the interplay between sensation and imagination which Taine studied at great length and out of which he believed emerges the world of the mind. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno was fascinated with both Zola and Taine early on .Paul Bouget and Guy de Maupassant were also heavily influenced by Taine.

Taine shared a correspondence with the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who later referred to him in Beyond Good and Evil as the first of living historians. He was also the subject of Stefan Zweigs doctoral thesis The Philosophy of Hippolyte Taine. Taine was also read by Peter Kropotkin who described him as truly understanding the French Revolution because he studied the movements preceding the revolution of July 14 or as he quoted Taine himself I know of three hundred outbreaks before July 14."
Gabriel Tarde,"Gabriel Tarde was a French sociologist criminologist and social psychologist who conceived sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation.

Tarde was born in Sarlat in the province of Dordogne and he studied law at Toulouse and Paris. From 1869 to 1894 he worked as a magistrate and investigating judge in the province. In the 1880s he corresponded with representatives of the newly formed criminal anthropology most notably the Italians Enrico Ferri and Cesare Lombroso and the French psychiatrist Alexandre Lacassagne. With the latter Tarde came to be the leading representative for a French school in criminology. In 1900 he was appointed professor in modern philosophy at the Collège de France. As such he was the most prominent contemporary critic of Durkheims sociology.

Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the group mind and economic psychology where he anticipated a number of modern developments. Tarde was very critical of Émile Durkheims work at the level of both methodology and theory. However Durkheims sociology overshadowed Tardes insights and it was not until U.S. scholars such as the Chicago school took up his theories that they became famous.

Tarde took an interest in criminology and the psychological basis of criminal behavior while working as a magistrate in public service. He was critical of the concept of the atavistic criminal as developed by Cesare Lombroso. Tardes criminological studies served as the underpinning of his later sociology.

Tarde also emphasized the tendency of the criminal to return to the scene of the crime and to repeat it which he saw as part of a wider process of repetition compulsion.

Tarde considered imitation conscious and unconscious as a fundamental interpersonal trait with the imitation of fathers by sons as the primal situation resting on prestige.

Tarde highlighted the importance of the creative exemplar in society arguing that genius is the capacity to engender ones own progeny.

Tarde also wrote a science-fiction novel entitled Underground Man . The plot is a post-apocalyptic story of an Earth destroyed by a new Ice Age. Humanity must rebuild a new civilization underground. The choice is made to lay the foundation of their utopia on music and art.

For example it has recently been revealed that in Difference and Repetition Deleuzes milestone book which affected his transition to a more socially-aware brand of philosophy and his writing partnership with Guattari Deleuze in fact re-centered his philosophical orientation around Tardes thesis that repetition serves difference rather than vice versa. Also on the heels of the re-release of Tardes works has come an important development in which French sociologist Bruno Latour has referred to Tarde as a possible predecessor to Actor-Network Theory in part because of Tardes criticisms of Durkheims conceptions of the Social.

A book The Social after Gabriel Tarde Debates and Assessments edited by Matei Candea was published by Routledge in 2010. It provides a set of mature critiques of the recent renaissance of Tarde as well as suggesting models for scholars to use Tardes thought in their scholarship. This book includes contributions that philosophically reflect the Latourian as well as Deleuzian approaches to Tarde and also highlight a number of new ways Tarde is being adapted in terms of methods in contemporary sociology particularly in the area of ethnography and the study of online communities. Additionally in 2010 Bruno Latour and Vincent Antonin Lepinay released a short book called The Science of Passionate Interests An Introduction to Gabriel Tardes Economic Anthropology in which they show how Tardes work offers a strong critique of the foundations of the economics discipline and economic methodology.

Tardes work has further influenced affect philosophy. For example in 2012 Tony D Sampsons book Virality Contagion Theory in the Age of Networks used a Tarde inspired imitation thesis to describe the tendency for emotions feelings and affects to spread accidentally on digital networks."
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin,"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ ; 1 May 1881 10 April 1955 was a French Jesuit priest scientist paleontologist theologian philosopher and teacher. He was Darwinian in outlook and the author of several influential theological and philosophical books.

He took part in the discovery of Peking Man. He conceived the vitalist idea of the Omega Point. With Vladimir Vernadsky he developed the concept of the noosphere.

In 1962 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith condemned several of Teilhards works based on their alleged ambiguities and doctrinal errors. Some eminent Catholic figures including Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have made positive comments on some of his ideas since. The response to his writings by scientists has been mostly critical.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was born in the Château of Sarcenat Orcines some fourkm north-west of Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne French Third Republic on 1 May 1881 as the fourth of eleven children of librarian Emmanuel Teilhard de Chardin and Berthe-Adèle née de Dompierre dHornoys of Picardy a great-grandniece of Voltaire. He inherited the double surname from his father who was descended on the Teilhard side from an ancient family of magistrates from Auvergne originating in Murat Cantal ennobled under Louis XVIII of France.

His father a graduate of the Ecole Nationale des Chartes served as a regional librarian and was a keen naturalist. He collected rocks insects and plants and encouraged nature studies in the family. Pierre Teilhards spirituality was awakened by his mother. When he was twelve he went to the Jesuit college of Mongré in Villefranche-sur-Saône where he completed the Baccalauréat in philosophy and mathematics. In 1899 he entered the Jesuit novitiate in Aix-en-Provence. In October 1900 he began his junior studies at the Collégiale Saint-Michel de Laval. On 25 March 1901 he made his first vows. In 1902 Teilhard completed a licentiate in literature at the University of Caen.

That same year the Emile Combes premiership took over from Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau in pursuit of an anti-clerical agenda. As a result religious associations had to submit their properties to state control which obliged the Jesuits to go into exile in the United Kingdom. Theilhard continued his philosophical studies on the island of Jersey until 1905. Strong in Science subjects he was despatched to teach physics at the Collège de la Sainte Famille in Cairo Khedivate of Egypt until 1908. From there he wrote in a letter t is the dazzling of the East foreseen and drunk greedily ... in its lights its vegetation its fauna and its deserts.

For the next four years he was a Scholastic at Ore Place in Hastings East Sussex where he acquired his theological formation. There he synthesized his scientific philosophical and theological knowledge in the light of evolution. At that time he read Creative Evolution by Henri Bergson about which he wrote that the only effect that brilliant book had upon me was to provide fuel at just the right moment and very briefly for a fire that was already consuming my heart and mind. Bergsons ideas were influential on his views on matter life and energy. On 24 August 1911 aged 30 he was ordained priest.

From 1912 to 1914 Teilhard worked in the paleontology laboratory of the National Museum of Natural History France studying the mammals of the middle Tertiary period. Later he studied elsewhere in Europe. In June 1912 he formed part of the original digging team with Arthur Smith Woodward and Charles Dawson at the Piltdown site after the discovery of the first fragments of the fraudulent Piltdown Man. Some have suggested he participated in the hoax.Marcellin Boule a specialist in Neanderthal studies who as early as 1915 had recognized the non-hominid origins of the Piltdown finds gradually guided Teilhard towards human paleontology. At the museums Institute of Human Paleontology he became a friend of Henri Breuil and in 1913 took part with him in excavations at the prehistoric painted Cave of El Castillo in northwest Spain.

Mobilized in December 1914 Teilhard served in World War I as a stretcher-bearer in the 8th Moroccan Rifles. For his valor he received several citations including the Médaille militaire and the Legion of Honor.

During the war he developed his reflections in his diaries and in letters to his cousin Marguerite Teillard-Chambon who later published a collection of them. He later wrote ...the war was a meeting ... with the Absolute. In 1916 he wrote his first essay La Vie Cosmique where his scientific and philosophical thought was revealed just as his mystical life. While on leave from the military he pronounced his solemn vows as a Jesuit in Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon on 26 May 1918. In August 1919 in Jersey he wrote Puissance spirituelle de la Matière .

At the University of Paris Teilhard pursued three unit degrees of natural science geology botany and zoology. His thesis treated the mammals of the French lower Eocene and their stratigraphy. After 1920 he lectured in geology at the Catholic Institute of Paris and after earning a science doctorate in 1922 became an assistant professor there.

In 1923 he traveled to China with Father Émile Licent who was in charge of a significant laboratory collaboration between the National Museum of Natural History and Marcellin Boules laboratory in Tianjin. Licent carried out considerable basic work in connection with missionaries who accumulated observations of a scientific nature in their spare time.

Teilhard wrote several essays including La Messe sur le Monde in the Ordos Desert. In the following year he continued lecturing at the Catholic Institute and participated in a cycle of conferences for the students of the Engineers Schools. Two theological essays on original sin were sent to a theologian at his request on a purely personal basis

The Church required him to give up his lecturing at the Catholic Institute in order to continue his geological research in China.

Teilhard traveled again to China in April 1926. He would remain there for about twenty years with many voyages throughout the world. He settled until 1932 in Tianjin with Émile Licent then in Beijing. Teilhard made five geological research expeditions in China between 1926 and 1935. They enabled him to establish a general geological map of China.

That same year Teilhards superiors in the Jesuit Order forbade him to teach any longer.

In 192627 after a missed campaign in Gansu Teilhard traveled in the Sanggan River Valley near Kalgan and made a tour in Eastern Mongolia. He wrote Le Milieu Divin . Teilhard prepared the first pages of his main work Le Phénomène Humain . The Holy See refused the Imprimatur for Le Milieu Divin in 1927. 

He joined the ongoing excavations of the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian as an advisor in 1926 and continued in the role for the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the China Geological Survey following its founding in 1928. Teilhard resided in Manchuria with Emile Licent staying in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi with the Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian and with Davidson Black Chairman of the China Geological Survey.

After a tour in Manchuria in the area of Greater Khingan with Chinese geologists Teilhard joined the team of American Expedition Center-Asia in the Gobi Desert organized in June and July by the American Museum of Natural History with Roy Chapman Andrews. Henri Breuil and Teilhard discovered that the Peking Man the nearest relative of Anthropopithecus from Java was a faber . Teilhard wrote LEsprit de la Terre .

Teilhard took part as a scientist in the Croisière Jaune financed by André Citroën in Central Asia. Northwest of Beijing in Kalgan he joined the Chinese group who joined the second part of the team the Pamir group in Aksu City. He remained with his colleagues for several months in Ürümqi capital of Xinjiang.

In 1933 Rome ordered him to give up his post in Paris. Teilhard subsequently undertook several explorations in the south of China. He traveled in the valleys of the Yangtze and Sichuan in 1934 then the following year in Guangxi and Guangdong. The relationship with Marcellin Boule was disrupted; the museum cut its financing on the grounds that Teilhard worked more for the Chinese Geological Service than for the museum.

During all these years Teilhard contributed considerably to the constitution of an international network of research in human paleontology related to the whole of eastern and southeastern Asia. He would be particularly associated in this task with two friends Davidson Black and the Scot George Brown Barbour. Often he would visit France or the United States only to leave these countries for further expeditions.

From 1927 to 1928 Teilhard based himself in Paris. He journeyed to Leuven Belgium and to Cantal and Ariège France. Between several articles in reviews he met new people such as Paul Valéry and Bruno de Solages who were to help him in issues with the Catholic Church.

Answering an invitation from Henry de Monfreid Teilhard undertook a journey of two months in Obock in Harar in the Ethiopian Empire and in Somalia with his colleague Pierre Lamarre a geologist before embarking in Djibouti to return to Tianjin. While in China Teilhard developed a deep and personal friendship with Lucile Swan.

During 19301931 Teilhard stayed in France and in the United States. During a conference in Paris Teilhard stated For the observers of the Future the greatest event will be the sudden appearance of a collective humane conscience and a human work to make. From 1932 to 1933 he began to meet people to clarify issues with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding Le Milieu divin and LEsprit de la Terre. He met Helmut de Terra a German geologist in the International Geology Congress in Washington D.C.

Teilhard participated in the 1935 YaleCambridge expedition in northern and central India with the geologist Helmut de Terra and Patterson who verified their assumptions on Indian Paleolithic civilisations in Kashmir and the Salt Range Valley. He then made a short stay in Java on the invitation of Dutch paleontologist Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald to the site of Java Man. A second cranium more complete was discovered. Professor von Koenigswald had also found a tooth in a Chinese apothecary shop in 1934 that he believed belonged to a three-meter-tall ape Gigantopithecus which lived between one hundred thousand and around a million years ago. Fossilized teeth and bone are often ground into powder and used in some branches of traditional Chinese medicine.

In 1937 Teilhard wrote Le Phénomène spirituel on board the boat Empress of Japan where he met the Sylvia Brett Ranee of Sarawak The ship conveyed him to the United States. He received the Mendel Medal granted by Villanova University during the Congress of Philadelphia in recognition of his works on human paleontology. He made a speech about evolution the origins and the destiny of man. The New York Times dated 19 March 1937 presented Teilhard as the Jesuit who held that man descended from monkeys. Some days later he was to be granted the Doctor Honoris Causa distinction from Boston College. Upon arrival in that city he was told that the award had been cancelled.

Rome banned his work LÉnergie Humaine in 1939. By this point Teilhard was based again in France where he was immobilized by malaria. During his return voyage to Beijing he wrote LEnergie spirituelle de la Souffrance .

In 1941 Teilhard submitted to Rome his most important work Le Phénomène Humain. By 1947 Rome forbade him to write or teach on philosophical subjects. The next year Teilhard was called to Rome by the Superior General of the Jesuits who hoped to acquire permission from the Holy See for the publication of Le Phénomène Humain. However the prohibition to publish it that was previously issued in 1944 was again renewed. Teilhard was also forbidden to take a teaching post in the Collège de France. Another setback came in 1949 when permission to publish Le Groupe Zoologique was refused.

Teilhard was nominated to the French Academy of Sciences in 1950. He was forbidden by his Superiors to attend the International Congress ofPaleontology in 1955. The Supreme Authority of the Holy Office in a decree dated 15 November 1957 forbade the works of de Chardin to be retained in libraries including those of religious institutes. His books were not to be sold in Catholic bookshops and were not to be translated into other languages.

The Diocese of Rome on 30 September 1963 required Catholic booksellers in Rome to withdraw his works as well as those that supported his views.

Teilhard died in New York City where he was in residence at the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius Loyola Park Avenue. On 15 March 1955 at the house of his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde Teilhard told friends he hoped he would die on Easter Sunday. On the evening of Easter Sunday 10 April 1955 during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra his personal assistant since 1949 Teilhard suffered a heart attack and died. He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate St. Andrew-on-Hudson in Hyde Park New York. With the moving of the novitiate the property was sold to the Culinary Institute of America in 1970.

Teilhard de Chardin wrote two comprehensive works The Phenomenon of Man and The Divine Milieu.

His posthumously published book The Phenomenon of Man set forth a sweeping account of the unfolding of the cosmos and the evolution of matter to humanity to ultimately a reunion with Christ. In the book Teilhard abandoned literal interpretations of creation in the Book of Genesis in favor of allegorical and theological interpretations. The unfolding of the material cosmos is described from primordial particles to the development of life human beings and the noosphere and finally to his vision of the Omega Point in the future which is pulling all creation towards it. He was a leading proponent of orthogenesis the idea that evolution occurs in a directional goal-driven way. Teilhard argued in Darwinian terms with respect to biology and supported the synthetic model of evolution but argued in Lamarckian terms for the development of culture primarily through the vehicle of education. Teilhard made a total commitment to the evolutionary process in the 1920s as the core of his spirituality at a time when other religious thinkers felt evolutionary thinking challenged the structure of conventional Christian faith. He committed himself to what the evidence showed.

Teilhard made sense of the universe by assuming it had a vitalist evolutionary process. He interprets complexity as the axis of evolution of matter into a geosphere a biosphere into consciousness and then to supreme consciousness . Jean Houstons story of meeting Teilhard illustrates this point.

Teilhards unique relationship to both paleontology and Catholicism allowed him to develop a highly progressive cosmic theology which took into account his evolutionary studies. Teilhard recognized the importance of bringing the Church into the modern world and approached evolution as a way of providing ontological meaning for Christianity particularly creation theology. For Teilhard evolution was the natural landscape where the history of salvation is situated.

Teilhards cosmic theology is largely predicated on his interpretation of Pauline scripture particularly Colossians 115-17 and 1 Corinthians 1528. He drew on the Christocentrism of these two Pauline passages to construct a cosmic theology which recognizes the absolute primacy of Christ. He understood creation to be a teleological process towards union with the Godhead effected through the incarnation and redemption of Christ in whom all things hold together . He further posited that creation would not be complete until each participated being is totally united with God through Christ in the Pleroma when God will be all in all .

Teilhards life work was predicated on his conviction that human spiritual development is moved by the same universal laws as material development. He wrote ...everything is the sum of the past and ...nothing is comprehensible except through its history. Nature is the equivalent of becoming self-creation this is the view to which experience irresistibly leads us. ... There is nothing not even the human soul the highest spiritual manifestation we know of that does not come within this universal law.The Phenomenon of Man represents Teilhards attempt at reconciling his religious faith with his academic interests as a paleontologist. One particularly poignant observation in Teilhards book entails the notion that evolution is becoming an increasingly optional process. Teilhard points to the societal problems of isolation and marginalization as huge inhibitors of evolution especially since evolution requires a unification of consciousness. He states that no evolutionary future awaits anyone except in association with everyone else. Teilhard argued that the human condition necessarily leads to the psychic unity of humankind though he stressed that this unity can only be voluntary; this voluntary psychic unity he termed unanimization. Teilhard also states that evolution is an ascent toward consciousness giving encephalization as an example of early stages and therefore signifies a continuous upsurge toward the Omega Point which for all intents and purposes is God.

Teilhard also used his perceived correlation between spiritual and material to describe Christ arguing that Christ not only has a mystical dimension but also takes on a physical dimension as he becomes the organizing principle of the universethat is the one who holds together the universe . For Teilhard Christ forms not only the eschatological end toward which his mysticalecclesial body is oriented but he also operates physically in order to regulate all things becoming the one from whom all creation receives its stability. In other words as the one who holds all things together Christ exercises a supremacy over the universe which is physical not simply juridical. He is the unifying center of the universe and its goal. The function of holding all things together indicates that Christ is not only man and God; he also possesses a third aspectindeed a third naturewhich is cosmic. In this way the Pauline description of the Body of Christ is not simply a mystical or ecclesial concept for Teilhard; it is cosmic. This cosmic Body of Christ extend ... the Body of Christ is the one single thing that is being made in creation. Teilhard describes this cosmic amassing of Christ as Christogenesis. According to Teilhard the universe is engaged in Christogenesis as it evolves toward its full realization at Omega a point which coincides with the fully realized Christ. It is at this point that God will be all in all .

Our century is probably more religious than any other. How could it fail to be with such problems to be solved The only trouble is that it has not yet found a God it can adore.

Tielhard has been criticized as incorporating common notions of Social Darwinism and scientific racism into his work along with support for eugenics though he has also been defended by theologian John Haught.

In 1925 Teilhard was ordered by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus Włodzimierz Ledóchowski to leave his teaching position in France and to sign a statement withdrawing his controversial statements regarding the doctrine of original sin. Rather than leave the Society of Jesus Teilhard signed the statement and left for China.

This was the first of a series of condemnations by a range of ecclesiastical officials that would continue until after Teilhards death. The climax of these condemnations was a 1962 monitum of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith cautioning on Teilhards works. It said

Several works of Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin some of which were posthumously published are being edited and are gaining a good deal of success. Prescinding from a judgement about those points that concern the positive sciences it is sufficiently clear that the above-mentioned works abound in such ambiguities and indeed even serious errors as to offend Catholic doctrine. For this reason the most eminent and most revered Fathers of the Holy Office exhort all Ordinaries as well as the superiors of Religious institutes rectors of seminaries and presidents of universities effectively to protect the minds particularly of the youth against the dangers presented by the works of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin and of his followers.

The Holy Office did not however place any of Teilhards writings on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum which existed during Teilhards lifetime and at the time of the 1962 decree.

Shortly thereafter prominent clerics mounted a strong theological defense of Teilhards works. Henri de Lubac wrote three comprehensive books on the theology of Teilhard de Chardin in the 1960s. While de Lubac mentioned that Teilhard was less than precise in some of his concepts he affirmed the orthodoxy of Teilhard de Chardin and responded to Teilhards critics We need not concern ourselves with a number of detractors of Teilhard in whom emotion has blunted intelligence. Later that decade Joseph Ratzinger a German theologian who became Pope Benedict XVI spoke glowingly of Teilhards Christology in Ratzingers Introduction to Christianity

It must be regarded as an important service of Teilhard de Chardins that he rethought these ideas from the angle of the modern view of the world and in spite of a not entirely unobjectionable tendency toward the biological approach nevertheless on the whole grasped them correctly and in any case made them accessible once again.

Over the next several decades prominent theologians and prelates including leading cardinals all wrote approvingly of Teilhards ideas. In 1981 Cardinal Agostino Casaroli wrote on the front page of the Vatican newspaper lOsservatore Romano

What our contemporaries will undoubtedly remember beyond the difficulties of conception and deficiencies of expression in this audacious attempt to reach a synthesis is the testimony of the coherent life of a man possessed by Christ in the depths of his soul. He was concerned with honoring both faith and reason and anticipated the response to John Paul IIs appeal Be not afraid open open wide to Christ the doors of the immense domains of culture civilization and progress.

On 20 July 1981 the Holy See stated that after consultation of Cardinal Casaroli and Cardinal Franjo Šeper the letter did not change the position of the warning issued by the Holy Office on 30 June 1962 which pointed out that Teilhards work contained ambiguities and grave doctrinal errors.

And so we can now say that the goal of worship and the goal of creation as a whole are one and the samedivinization a world of freedom and love. But this means that the historical makes its appearance in the cosmic. The cosmos is not a kind of closed building a stationary container in which history may by chance take place. It is itself movement from its one beginning to its one end. In a sense creation is history. Against the background of the modern evolutionary world view Teilhard de Chardin depicted the cosmos as a process of ascent a series of unions. From very simple beginnings the path leads to ever greater and more complex unities in which multiplicity is not abolished but merged into a growing synthesis leading to the Noosphere in which spirit and its understanding embrace the whole and are blended into a kind of living organism. Invoking the epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians Teilhard looks on Christ as the energy that strives toward the Noosphere and finally incorporates everything in its fullness. From here Teilhard went on to give a new meaning to Christian worship the transubstantiated Host is the anticipation of the transformation and divinization of matter in the christological fullness. In his view the Eucharist provides the movement of the cosmos with its direction; it anticipates its goal and at the same time urges it on.

In his own poetic style the French Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin liked to meditate on the Eucharist as the first fruits of the new creation. In an essay called The Monstrance he describes how kneeling in prayer he had a sensation that the Host was beginning to grow until at last through its mysterious expansion the whole world had become incandescent had itself become like a single giant Host. Although it would probably be incorrect to imagine that the universe will eventually be transubstantiated Teilhard correctly identified the connection between the Eucharist and the final glorification of the cosmos.

Hardly anyone else has tried to bring together the knowledge of Christ and the idea of evolution as the scientist and theologian Fr. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin S.J. has done.... His fascinating vision... has represented a great hope the hope that faith in Christ and a scientific approach to the world can be brought together.... These brief references to Teilhard cannot do justice to his efforts. The fascination which Teilhard de Chardin exercised for an entire generation stemmed from his radical manner of looking at science and Christian faith together.

In July 2009 Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said By now no one would dream of saying that is a heterodox author who shouldnt be studied.

Pope Francis refers to Teilhards eschatological contribution in his encyclical Laudato si.

The philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand criticized severely the work of Teilhard. According to Hildebrand in a conversation after a lecture by Teilhard He ignored completely the decisive difference between nature and supernature. After a lively discussion in which I ventured a criticism of his ideas I had an opportunity to speak to Teilhard privately. When our talk touched on St. Augustine he exclaimed violently Dont mention that unfortunate man; he spoiled everything by introducing the supernatural. Von Hildebrand writes that Teilhardism is incompatible with Christianity substitutes efficiency for sanctity dehumanizes man and describes love as merely cosmic energy.

Julian Huxley the evolutionary biologist in the preface to the 1955 edition of The Phenomenon of Man praised the thought of Teilhard de Chardin for looking at the way in which human development needs to be examined within a larger integrated universal sense of evolution though admitting he could not follow Teilhard all the way.Theodosius Dobzhansky writing in 1973 drew upon Teilhards insistence that evolutionary theory provides the core of how man understands his relationship to nature calling him one of the great thinkers of our age.

According to Daniel Dennett it has become clear to the point of unanimity among scientists that Teilhard offered nothing serious in the way of an alternative to orthodoxy; the ideas that were peculiarly his were confused and the rest was just bombastic redescription of orthodoxy.Steven Rose wrote that Teilhard is revered as a mystic of genius by some but among most biologists is seen as little more than a charlatan.

In 1961 British immunologist and Nobel laureate Peter Medawar wrote a scornful review of The Phenomenon of Man for the journal Mind the greater part of it It is the style that creates the illusion of content. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins called Medawars review devastating and The Phenomenon of Man the quintessence of bad poetic science.

George Gaylord Simpson felt that if Teilhard were right the lifework of Huxley Dobzhansky and hundreds of others was not only wrong but meaningless and was mystified by their public support for him. He considered Teilhard a friend and his work in paleontology extensive and important but expressed strongly adverse views of his contributions as scientific theorist and philosopher.

In 2019 evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson praised Teilhards book The Phenomenon of Man as scientifically prophetic in many ways and considers his own work as an updated version of it commenting that odern evolutionary theory shows that what Teilhard meant by the Omega Point is achievable in the foreseeable future.

Brian Swimme wrote Teilhard was one of the first scientists to realize that the human and the universe are inseparable. The only universe we know about is a universe that brought forth the human.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is honored with a feast day on the Calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church on 10 April.George Gaylord Simpson named the most primitive and ancient genus of true primate the Eocene genus Teilhardina.

Teilhard and his work continue to influence the arts and culture. Characters based on Teilhard appear in several novels including Jean Telemond in Morris Wests The Shoes of the Fisherman . In Dan Simmons 198997 Hyperion Cantos Teilhard de Chardin has been canonized a saint in the far future. His work inspires the anthropologist priest character Paul Duré. When Duré becomes Pope he takes Teilhard I as his regnal name. Teilhard appears as a minor character in the play Fake by Eric Simonson staged by Chicagos Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 2009 involving a fictional solution to the infamous Piltdown Man hoax.

References range from occasional quotationsan auto mechanic quotes Teilhard in Philip K. Dicks A Scanner Darklyto serving as the philosophical underpinning of the plot as Teilhards work does in Julian Mays 198794 Galactic Milieu Series. Teilhard also plays a major role in Annie Dillards 1999 For the Time Being. Teilhard is mentioned by name and the Omega Point briefly explained in Arthur C. Clarkes and Stephen Baxters The Light of Other Days.The title of the short-story collection Everything That Rises Must Converge by Flannery OConnor is a reference to Teilhards work. The American novelist Don DeLillos 2010 novel Point Omega borrows its title and some of its ideas from Teilhard de Chardin.Robert Wright in his book Nonzero The Logic of Human Destiny compares his own naturalistic thesis that biological and cultural evolution are directional and possibly purposeful with Teilhards ideas.

Teilhards work also inspired philosophical ruminations by Italian laureate architect Paolo Soleri and Mexican writer Margarita Casasús Altamirano artworks such as French painter Alfred Manessiers LOffrande de la terre ou Hommage à Teilhard de Chardin and American sculptor Frederick Harts acrylic sculpture The Divine Milieu Homage to Teilhard de Chardin. A sculpture of the Omega Point by Henry Setter with a quote from Teilhard de Chardin can be found at the entrance to the Roesch Library at the University of Dayton. The Spanish painter Salvador Dalí was fascinated by Teilhard de Chardin and the Omega Point theory. His 1959 painting The Ecumenical Council is said to represent the interconnectedness of the Omega Point.

Edmund Rubbras 1968 Symphony No. 8 is titled Hommage à Teilhard de Chardin.

The Embracing Universe an oratorio for choir and 7 instruments composed by Justin Grounds to a libretto by Fred LaHaye saw its first performance in 2019. It is based on the life and thought of Teilhard de Chardin.

Several college campuses honor Teilhard. A building at the University of Manchester is named after him as are residence dormitories at Gonzaga University and Seattle University.

The De Chardin Project a play celebrating Teilhards life ran from 20 November to 14 December 2014 in Toronto Canada.The Evolution of Teilhard de Chardin a documentary film on Teilhards life was scheduled for release in 2015.

Founded in 1978 George Addair based much of Omega Vector on Teilhards work.

The American physicist Frank J. Tipler has further developed Teilhards Omega Point concept in two controversial books The Physics of Immortality and the more theologically based Physics of Christianity. While keeping the central premise of Teilhards Omega Point Tipler has supplanted some of the more mystical theological elements of the OPT with his own scientific and mathematical observations .

In 1972 the Uruguayan priest Juan Luis Segundo in his five-volume series A Theology for Artisans of a New Humanity wrote that Teilhard noticed the profound analogies existing between the conceptual elements used by the natural sciences all of them being based on the hypothesis of a general evolution of the universe.

Marguerite Teillard-Chambon was a French writer who edited and had published three volumes of correspondence with her cousin Pierre Teilhard de Chardin La genèse dune pensée being the last after her own death in 1959. She furnished each with an introduction. Marguerite a year older than Teilhard was considered among those who knew and understood him best. They had shared a childhood in Auvergne; she it was who encouraged him to undertake a doctorate in science at the Sorbonne; she eased his entry into the Catholic Institute through her connection to Emmanuel de Margerie and she introduced him to the intellectual life of Paris. Throughout the First World War she corresponded with him acting as a midwife to his thinking helping his thought to emerge and honing it. In September 1959 she participated in a gathering organised at Saint-Babel near Issoire devoted to Teilhards philosophical contribution. On the way home to Chambon-sur-Lac she was fatally injured in a road traffic accident. Her sister Alice completed the final preparations for the publication of the final volume of her cousin Teilhards wartime letters.

Teilhard has had a profound influence on the New Age movements and has been described as perhaps the man most responsible for the spiritualization of evolution in a global and cosmic context.

Teilhards words about likening the discovery of the power of love to the second time man will have discovered the power of fire were quoted in the sermon of the Most Reverend Michael Curry Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church during the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on 20 May 2018.

The dates in parentheses are the dates of first publication in French and English. Most of these works were written years earlier but Teilhards ecclesiastical order forbade him to publish them because of their controversial nature. The essay collections are organized by subject rather than date thus each one typically spans many years."
Theobald of Étampes,"Theobald of Étampes was a medieval schoolmaster and theologian hostile to priestly celibacy. He is the first scholar known to have lectured at Oxford and is considered a forerunner of Oxford University.

Theobalds biography has been reconstructed by Bernard Gineste. Theobald was a canon and the son of a canon from Étampes. As a child he knew many married priests around Étampes at a time when the Gregorian reform was seeking to enforce clerical celibacy. He was probably educated in the Chartres Cathedral School and became master of the school of the parish of Saint-Martin at Étampes and a private tutor to the young viscount of Chartres Hugh III of Le Puiset. After King Philip I of France annexed Étampes to the royal domain he began to favour the monks of Morigny over the local priests. In 1113 after Hugh of Le Puiset was captured and imprisoned by royal forces Theobald left Étampes for the Duchy of Normandy. There he became schoolmaster at Caen and planned to leave France for Denmark but in the end he crossed the Channel to England where the Duke of Normandy Henry Beauclerc was king. At Oxford he gave public lectures to audiences of between 60 and 100 clerics.

Six letters of Theobald of Étampes have been preserved.

Two are written in Caen. The first is a letter written to a certain Philipp who had committed an undetermined sexual deviation and sustained harassment accordingly; consoling him Theobald develops the idea that the faults of this kind are not the most serious and that pride is a far more dangerous sin; he very clearly suggests that those who make profession of chastity often fall into pedophilia. The second letter is sent to a Queen Margarita thought until recently to be Saint Margaret of Scotland died in 1093 but Gineste has shown she is Margaret Fredkulla Queen of Denmark still alive in 1116. He thanked the Queen of liberality of the Abbey of Saint-Étienne of Caen and seems to make service offerings.

Four are written from Oxford. It seems impossible to give them a chronological order. One is addressed to Faritius Abbot of Abingdon to defend himself from a charge of heresy. He has defended and shows that his teaching is Orthodox dead children who have not been baptized go to hell. The second letter is sent to the Bishop of Lincoln England; it is the longest and is proving by the authority of Scripture and the Fathers of the Church that even the greatest sinners can access the salvation if he repents up to his final hour. The third is addressed to the heretical Roscellinus of Compiègne. However the doctrine of Roscellinus about Trinity does not interest Theobald. He accuses him of criticizing the sons of priests and defends them by pointing out that Saint John the Baptist was one. He also expresses an extremely rare opinion on this subject the Virgin Mary was also a daughter of a priest. The last of these four letters of Oxford deals with the monks and denies them the right to take the place of the clerics and to collect tithes and benefits which were until then the monopoly of the clerics and the canons.

This last quite short letter has subjected to an anonymous monk an endless answer partly written in verses which strongly supports the clerics and the canons of the time and praise in return for the monks trimmed of all virtues."
Gustave Thibon,"Gustave Thibon was a French philosopher.He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.

Although essentially self-taught Thibon was an avid reader especially of poetry in French Provençal and Latin. He was very impressed by the First World War which led him to hate patriotism and democracy. The young Gustave Thibon travelled extensively at first to London and Italy and later to North Africa where he served in the military before returning to his native village at the age of 23. Under the influence of writers such as Léon Bloy and Jacques Maritain he converted to Catholicism. At the invitation of the latter he started his literary career in the pages of the Revue Thomiste.

During World War II Thibon hosted the philosopher Simone Weil at his farm; he published S. Weils work La Pesanteur et la Grâce in 1947."
Xavier Tilliette,"Xavier Tilliette was a French philosopher historian of philosophy and theologian. A former student of Jean Wahl and of Vladimir Jankélévitch he was a member of the Society of Jesus and professor emeritus at the Catholic Institute of Paris having taught also at the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome the Lateran University and the Centre Sèvres in Paris.

Alexis de Tocqueville,"Alexis Charles Henri Clérel comte de Tocqueville colloquially known as Tocqueville was a French aristocrat diplomat political scientist political philosopher and historian. He is best known for his works Democracy in America and The Old Regime and the Revolution . In both he analysed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocquevilles travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.

Tocqueville was active in French politics first under the July Monarchy and then during the Second Republic which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonapartes 2 December 1851 coup and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. Tocqueville argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. He believed the failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals.

Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government and was skeptical of the extremes of democracy. During his time in parliament he sat on the centre-left but the complex and restless nature of his liberalism has led to contrasting interpretations and admirers across the political spectrum. Regarding his political position Tocqueville wrote the word left is the word I wanted to attach to my name so that it would remain attached to it forever.

Tocqueville came from an old Norman aristocratic family. He was the great-grandson of the statesman Malesherbes who had been guillotined in 1794. His parents Hervé Louis François Jean Bonaventure Clérel Count of Tocqueville an officer of the Constitutional Guard of King Louis XVI; and Louise Madeleine Le Peletier de Rosanbo narrowly escaped the guillotine due to the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in 1794.

Under the Bourbon Restoration Tocquevilles father became a noble peer and prefect. Tocqueville attended the Lycée Fabert in Metz.

Tocqueville who despised the July Monarchy began his political career in 1839. From 1839 to 1851 he served as member of the lower house of parliament for the Manche department . He sat on the centre-left defended abolitionist views and upheld free trade while supporting the colonisation of Algeria carried on by Louis-Philippes regime.

In 1842 he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

In 1847 he sought to found a Young Left party which would advocate wage increases a progressive tax and other labor concerns in order to undermine the appeal of the socialists. Tocqueville was also elected general counsellor of Manche in 1842 and became the president of the departments general council between 1849 and 1852; he resigned as he refused to pledge allegiance to the Second Empire. According to one account Tocquevilles political position became untenable during this time in the sense that he was mistrusted by both the left and right and was looking for an excuse to leave France.

In 1831 Tocqueville obtained from the July Monarchy a mission to examine prisons and penitentiaries in the United States and proceeded there with his lifelong friend Gustave de Beaumont. While he did visit some prisons Tocqueville traveled widely in the United States and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections. He returned within nine months and published a report but the real result of his tour was De la démocratie en Amérique which appeared in 1835. Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in Jacksonian America Marie or Slavery in the United States . During this trip he made a side trip to Montreal and Quebec City in Lower Canada from mid-August to early September 1831.

Apart from North America Tocqueville also made an observational tour of England producing Memoir on Pauperism. In 1841 and 1846 he traveled to the French colony of Algeria. His first travel inspired his Travail sur lAlgérie in which he criticized the French model of colonisation which emphasized assimilation to Western culture advocating that the French government instead adopt a form of indirect rule which avoided mixing different populations together. He went as far as openly advocating racial segregation between European colonists and Arabs through the implementation of two different legislative systems for each ethnic group .

In 1835 Tocqueville made a journey through Ireland. His observations provide one of the best pictures of how Ireland stood before the Great Famine . The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived. Tocqueville made clear both his opposition to aristocratic power and his affinity for his Irish co-religionists.

After the fall of the July Monarchy during the French Revolution of 1848 Tocqueville was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of 1848 where he became a member of the commission charged with the drafting of the new Constitution of the Second Republic . He defended bicameralism and the election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage. As the countryside was thought to be more conservative than the labouring population of Paris universal suffrage was conceived as a means to counteract the revolutionary spirit of Paris.

During the Second Republic Tocqueville sided with the Party of Order against the socialists. A few days after the February insurrection he believed that a violent clash between the Parisian workers population led by socialists agitating in favour of a Democratic and Social Republic and the conservatives which included the aristocracy and the rural population was inescapable. As Tocqueville had foreseen these social tensions eventually exploded during the June Days Uprising of 1848.

Led by General Cavaignac the suppression was supported by Tocqueville who advocated the regularization of the state of siege declared by Cavaignac and other measures promoting suspension of the constitutional order. Between May and September Tocqueville participated in the Constitutional Commission which wrote the new Constitution. His proposals underlined the importance of his North American experience as his amendment about the President and his reelection.

A supporter of Cavaignac and of the Party of Order Tocqueville accepted an invitation to enter Odilon Barrots government as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 3 June to 31 October 1849. During the troubled days of June 1849 he pleaded with Interior Minister Jules Armand Dufaure for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press.

This active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in Democracy in America. According to Tocqueville he favored order as the sine qua non for the conduct of serious politics. He to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change.

Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against Louis Napoléon Bonaparte for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoléon Bonapartes 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the 10th arrondissement of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for high treason as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at Vincennes and then released Tocqueville who supported the Restoration of the Bourbons against Napoleon IIIs Second Empire quit political life and retreated to his castle .

Against this image of Tocqueville biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believedhad given it in all thirteen years of his life . He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight but conducting it now from libraries archives and his own desk. There he began the draft of LAncien Régime et la Révolution publishing the first tome in 1856 but leaving the second one unfinished.

A longtime sufferer from bouts of tuberculosis Tocqueville would eventually succumb to the disease on 16 April 1859 and was buried in the Tocqueville cemetery in Normandy.

Tocquevilles professed religion was Roman Catholicism. He saw religion as being compatible with both equality and individualism but felt that religion would be strongest when separated from politics.

In Democracy in America published in 1835 Tocqueville wrote of the New World and its burgeoning democratic order. Observing from the perspective of a detached social scientist Tocqueville wrote of his travels through the United States in the early 19th century when the Market Revolution Western expansion and Jacksonian democracy were radically transforming the fabric of American life.

As emphasized in Introduction to Book I the purpose of the work is somewhat beyond the American democracy itself which was rather an illustration to the philosophical claim that democracy is an effect of industrialization. In a sense Tocqueville anticipated Marxs viewpoint that history is determined by development and changes of socio-economic conditions the so-called formations that are described by specific productive forces and relations of production. This focus on the philosophy of history justifies a certain ambiguity in using the word democracy and explains why Tocqueville even ignores the intents of the Founding Fathers of the United States regarding the American political system

To pursue the central idea of his study a democratic revolution caused by industrialization as exemplified by America Tocqueville persistently refers to democracy. This is in fact very different from what the Founding Fathers of the United States meant. Moreover Tocqueville himself is not quite consistent in using the word democracy applying it alternately to representative government universal suffrage or majority-based governance.

According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan one purpose of writing Democracy in America was to help the people of France get a better understanding of their position between a fading aristocratic order and an emerging democratic order and to help them sort out the confusion. Tocqueville saw democracy as an equation that balanced liberty and equality concern for the individual as well as for the community.

Tocqueville was an ardent supporter of liberty. I have a passionate love for liberty law and respect for rights he wrote. I am neither of the revolutionary party nor of the conservative. Liberty is my foremost passion. He wrote of Political Consequences of the Social State of the Anglo-Americans by saying But one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality which impels the weak to want to bring the strong down to their level and which reduces men to preferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom.

The above is often misquoted as a slavery quote because of previous translations of the French text. The most recent translation by Arthur Goldhammer in 2004 translates the meaning to be as stated above. Examples of misquoted sources are numerous on the internet but the text does not contain the words Americans were so enamored by equality anywhere.

His view on government reflects his belief in liberty and the need for individuals to be able to act freely while respecting others rights. Of centralized government he wrote that it excels in preventing not doing.

Tocqueville continues to comment on equality by saying Furthermore when citizens are all almost equal it becomes difficult for them to defend their independence against the aggressions of power. As none of them is strong enough to fight alone with advantage the only guarantee of liberty is for everyone to combine forces. But such a combination is not always in evidence.

Tocqueville explicitly cites inequality as being incentive for the poor to become rich and notes that it is not often that two generations within a family maintain success and that it is inheritance laws that split and eventually break apart someones estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and the rich thereby over generations making the poor rich and the rich poor. He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the United States.

Tocquevilles main purpose was to analyze the functioning of political society and various forms of political associations although he brought some reflections on civil society too . For Tocqueville as for Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx civil society was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by civil code. As a critic of individualism Tocqueville thought that through associating for mutual purpose both in public and private Americans are able to overcome selfish desires thus making both a self-conscious and active political society and a vibrant civil society functioning according to political and civil laws of the state.

According to political scientist Joshua Kaplan Tocqueville did not originate the concept of individualism instead he changed its meaning and saw it as a calm and considered feeling which deposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends ith this little society formed to his taste he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself. While Tocqueville saw egotism and selfishness as vices he saw individualism as not a failure of feeling but as a way of thinking about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together or negative consequences such as isolation and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding.

When individualism was a positive force and prompted people to work together for common purposes and seen as self-interest properly understood then it helped to counterbalance the danger of the tyranny of the majority since people could take control over their own lives without government aid. According to Kaplan Americans have a difficult time accepting Tocquevilles criticism of the stifling intellectual effect of the omnipotence of the majority and that Americans tend to deny that there is a problem in this regard.

Egoism springs from a blind instinct; individualism from wrong-headed thinking rather than from depraved feelings. It originates as much from defects of intelligence as from the mistakes of the heart. Egoism blights the seeds of every virtue; individualism at first dries up only the source of public virtue. In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.

Tocqueville warned that modern democracy may be adept at inventing new forms of tyranny because radical equality could lead to the materialism of an expanding bourgeoisie and to the selfishness of individualism. In such conditions we might become so enamored with a relaxed love of present enjoyments that we lose interest in the future of our descendants...and meekly allow ourselves to be led in ignorance by a despotic force all the more powerful because it does not resemble one wrote The New Yorkers James Wood. Tocqueville worried that if despotism were to take root in a modern democracy it would be a much more dangerous version than the oppression under the Roman emperors or tyrants of the past who could only exert a pernicious influence on a small group of people at a time.

In contrast a despotism under a democracy could see a multitude of men uniformly alike equal constantly circling for petty pleasures unaware of fellow citizens and subject to the will of a powerful state which exerted an immense protective power. Tocqueville compared a potentially despotic democratic government to a protective parent who wants to keep its citizens as perpetual children and which does not break mens wills but rather guides it and presides over people in the same way as a shepherd looking after a flock of timid animals.

Tocquevilles penetrating analysis sought to understand the peculiar nature of American political life. In describing the American he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried to understand why the United States was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. In contrast to the aristocratic ethic the United States was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented where commoners never deferred to elites and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had taken root to an extraordinary degree.

Tocqueville writes Among a democratic people where there is no hereditary wealth every man works to earn a living. Labor is held in honor; the prejudice is not against but in its favor. Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child usually a man inherited the estate which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation.

In contrast landed elites in the United States were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture which meant that as time went by large estates became broken up within a few generations which in turn made the children more equal overall. According to Joshua Kaplans Tocqueville it was not always a negative development since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall hereditary fortunes in the new democracies became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living.

As Tocqueville understood it this rapidly democratizing society had a population devoted to middling values which wanted to amass through hard work vast fortunes. In Tocquevilles mind this explained why the United States was so different from Europe. In Europe he claimed nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth while the upper classes found it crass vulgar and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money and many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in the United States workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries.

Despite maintaining that the balance of property determined the balance of power Tocqueville argued that as the United States showed equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact it did quite the opposite as the widespread relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished the United States and determined its mores and values also explained why the United States masses held elites in such contempt.

Beyond the eradication of old-world aristocracy ordinary Americans also refused to defer to those possessing as Tocqueville put it superior talent and intelligence and these natural elites could not enjoy much share in political power as a result. Ordinary Americans enjoyed too much power and claimed too great a voice in the public sphere to defer to intellectual superiors. This culture promoted a relatively pronounced equality Tocqueville argued but the same mores and opinions that ensured such equality also promoted mediocrity. Those who possessed true virtue and talent were left with limited choices.

Tocqueville said that those with the most education and intelligence were left with two choices. They could join limited intellectual circles to explore the weighty and complex problems facing society or they could use their superior talents to amass vast fortunes in the private sector. He wrote that he did not know of any country where there was less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in America.

Tocqueville blamed the omnipotence of majority rule as a chief factor in stifling thinking The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence. A writer is free inside that area but woe to the man who goes beyond it not that he stands in fear of an inquisition but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys. According to Kaplans interpretation of Tocqueville he argued in contrast to previous political thinkers that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong but that people were too weak and felt powerless as the danger is that people felt swept up in something that they could not control.

The first who attracts the eye the first in enlightenment in power and in happiness is the white man the European man par excellence; below him appear the Negro and the Indian. These two unfortunate races have neither birth nor face nor language nor mores in common; only their misfortunes look alike. Both occupy an equally inferior position in the country that they inhabit; both experience the effects of tyranny; and if their miseries are different they can accuse the same author for them.

The men sent to Virginia were seekers of gold adventurers without resources and without character whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony. dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into society and with idleness ignorance and pride luxury and distress. It enervates the powers of the mind and benumbs the activity of man. On this same English foundation there developed in the North very different characteristics.

If the colony of Liberia were able to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year and if the Negroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union were to supply the society with annual subsidies and to transport the Negroes to Africa in government vessels it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of population among the blacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born upon its territory within that time it could not prevent the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the states. The Negro race will never leave those shores of the American continent to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it continues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard the calamities which they apprehend but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause.

I do not think it is for me a foreigner to indicate to the United States the time the measures or the men by whom Slavery shall be abolished. Still as the persevering enemy of despotism everywhere and under all its forms I am pained and astonished by the fact that the freest people in the world is at the present time almost the only one among civilized and Christian nations which yet maintains personal servitude; and this while serfdom itself is about disappearing where it has not already disappeared from the most degraded nations of Europe.An old and sincere friend of America I am uneasy at seeing Slavery retard her progress tarnish her glory furnish arms to her detractors compromise the future career of the Union which is the guaranty of her safety and greatness and point out beforehand to her to all her enemies the spot where they are to strike. As a man too I am moved at the spectacle of mans degradation by man and I hope to see the day when the law will grant equal civil liberty to all the inhabitants of the same empire as God accords the freedom of the will without distinction to the dwellers upon earth.

According to Tocqueville assimilation of black people would be almost impossible and this was already being demonstrated in the Northern states. As Tocqueville predicted formal freedom and equality and segregation would become this populations reality after the Civil War and during Reconstruction as would the bumpy road to true integration of black people.

However assimilation was the best solution for Native Americans and since they were too proud to assimilate they would inevitably become extinct. Displacement was another part of Americas Indian policy. Both populations were undemocratic or without the qualities intellectual and otherwise needed to live in a democracy. Tocqueville shared many views on assimilation and segregation of his and the coming epochs but he opposed Arthur de Gobineaus theories as found in The Inequality of Human Races .

In his Democracy in America Tocqueville also forecast the preeminence of the United States and Russia as the two main global powers. In his book he stated There are now two great nations in the world which starting from different points seem to be advancing toward the same goal the Russians and the Anglo-Americans. Each seems called by some secret design of Providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world.

Tocqueville believed that the American jury system was particularly important in educating citizens in self-government and rule of law. He often expressed how the civil jury system was one of the most effective showcases of democracy because it connected citizens with the true spirit of the justice system. In his 1835 treatise Democracy in America he explained The jury and more especially the civil jury serves to communicate the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit with the habits which attend it is the soundest preparation for free institutions. It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy; it makes them all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge toward society; and the part which they take in the Government.

Tocqueville believed that jury service not only benefited the society as a whole but enhanced jurors qualities as citizens. Because of the jury system they were better informed about the rule of law and they were more closely connected to the state. Thus quite independently of what the jury contributed to dispute resolution participation on the jury had salutary effects on the jurors themselves.

As far as I am concerned I came back from Africa with the pathetic notion that at present in our way of waging war we are far more barbaric than the Arabs themselves. These days they represent civilization we do not. This way of waging war seems to me as stupid as it is cruel. It can only be found in the head of a coarse and brutal soldier. Indeed it was pointless to replace the Turks only to reproduce what the world rightly found so hateful in them. This even for the sake of interest is more noxious than useful; for as another officer was telling me if our sole aim is to equal the Turks in fact we shall be in a far lower position than theirs barbarians for barbarians the Turks will always outdo us because they are Muslim barbarians. In France I have often heard men I respect but do not approve of deplore that crops should be burnt and granaries emptied and finally that unarmed men women and children should be seized. In my view these are unfortunate circumstances that any people wishing to wage war against the Arabs must accept. I think that all the means available to wreck tribes must be used barring those that the human kind and the right of nations condemn. I personally believe that the laws of war enable us to ravage the country and that we must do so either by destroying the crops at harvest time or any time by making fast forays also known as raids whose aim is to get hold of men or flocks.Whatever the case we may say in a general manner that all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria.

Tocqueville thought the conquest of Algeria was important for two reasons first his understanding of the international situation and Frances position in the world; and second changes in French society. Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would restore national pride; threatened he believed by the gradual softening of social mores in the middle classes. Their taste for material pleasures was spreading to the whole of society giving it an example of weakness and egotism.

Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud Tocqueville went so far to claim that war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.

Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Crémieux decree and the Indigenousness Code which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship.

In opposition to Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison Jean-Louis Benoît said that given the extent of racial prejudices during the colonization of Algeria Tocqueville was one of its most moderate supporters. Benoît said that it was wrong to assume Tocqueville was a supporter of Bugeaud despite his 1841 apologetic discourse. It seems that Tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to Algeria in 1846 as he criticized Bugeauds desire to invade Kabylie in an 1847 speech to the Assembly.

Although Tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law administrators schools and so on for Arabs who had come under French control he judged the Berber tribes of Kabylie as savages not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction.

Tocquevilles views on the matter were complex. Although in his 1841 report on Algeria he applauded Bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated Abd-el-Kaders resistance he had advocated in the Two Letters that the French military advance leave Kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into Kabylie.

In the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds Tocqueville denounced Bugeauds conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the Assembly not to vote funds in support of Bugeauds military columns. Tocqueville considered Bugeauds plan to invade Kabylie despite the opposition of the Assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice.

In his 1847 Report on Algeria Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the European colonization of the Americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences. More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged colonization will end in a blood bath.

Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria including the various Arab tribes independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains and the powerful political leader Abd-el-Kader. In his various letters and essays on Algeria Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism. In particular the author differentiates between what he terms dominance and a particular version of colonization.

The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria the Port of Algiers and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria was not. Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas.

Tocqueville argued that though unpleasant domination via violent means is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war. Such laws are not discussed in detail but given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with just war theorys jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory his approach does not accord with just war theorys jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination.

In 1856 Tocqueville published The Old Regime and the Revolution. The book analyzes French society before the French Revolutionthe so-called Ancien Régimeand investigates the forces that caused the Revolution.

Tocqueville was quoted in several chapters of Toby Youngs memoirs How to Lose Friends and Alienate People to explain his observation of widespread homogeneity of thought even amongst intellectual elites at Harvard University during his time spent there. He is frequently quoted and studied in American history classes. Tocqueville is the inspiration for Australian novelist Peter Carey in his 2009 novel Parrot and Olivier in America."
Claude Tresmontant,"Claude Tresmontant was a French philosopher Hellenist and theologian.

Claude Tresmontant taught medieval philosophy and philosophy of science at the Sorbonne. He was a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. He was given the Maximilien-Kolbe Prize in 1973 and the Grand Prix of the Academy of Moral and Political Science for his complete works in 1987."
André Tubeuf,"Tubeuf was born in Smyrna Turkey. A condisciple in Beirut Lebanon France of Salah Stétié and Robert Abirached Tubeuf came to Paris France after the war and performed his khâgne at the lycee Louis-le-Grand where he joined Dominique Fernandez Michel Deguy Jacques Derrida and his cousin Pierre-Jean Rémy.

In 1950 Tubeuf was received at the École normale supérieure rue dUlm where he first followed the teaching of Michel Alexandre then that of Louis Althusser and Maurice Merleau-Ponty and became friends with Gérard Granel.

In 1951 with Maurice Clavel Tubeuf translated Electra by Sophocles for Silvia Monfort.

An agrégé in philosophy Tubeuf taught this subject in philosophy class and then in Classes préparatoires littéraires at the lycée Fustel-de-Coulanges in Strasbourg from 1957 to 1992.

In 1972 he joined the Ministry of Culture in the cabinet of Jacques Duhamel to deal with musical matters; he pursued this experience in 1975 in the office of Michel Guy.

From 1976 Tubeuf mainly collaborated with the magazine Le Point but also at Avant Scène Opéra Harmonie and Lyrica then Diapason and finally Classica. In addition he was a regular lecturer such as at the Salzburg Festival and radio broadcaster.

After Romain Rolland André Suarès and Vladimir Jankélévitch of whom he was the pupil he renewed the genre of musical literature in France escaping the novelistic genre without falling into musicology.

In addition to his essays on Mozart Ludwig van BeethovenRichard Wagner Giuseppe Verdi Richard Strauss and the lied Tubeuf wrote profiles of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau Claudio Arrau Hans Hotter Rudolf Serkin Arthur Rubinstein Régine Crespin Daniel Barenboim Hélène Grimaud and Cecilia Bartoli."
Étienne Vacherot,"Vacherot was born of peasant parentage at Torcenay near Langres in the Haute-Marne département of France.He was educated at the École Normale and returned there as director of studies in 1838 after some years spent in provincial schoolmasterships. In 1839 he succeeded his master Cousin as professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne. His Histoire critique de lécole dAlexandrie was his first and best-known work. It drew on him attacks from the Clerical party which led to his suspension in 1851. Shortly afterwards he refused to swear allegiance to the new imperial government and was dismissed from his post. His work Démocratie led to a political prosecution and imprisonment.

On 7 March 1868 he was elected to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques. Upon the fall of the Empire he took an active part in politics was maire of a district of Paris during the siege and in 1871 was in the National Assembly voting as a Moderate Liberal. In 1873 he drew nearer the Conservatives after which he was never again successful as a parliamentary candidate though he maintained his principles vigorously in the press.

While a noted freethinker in the 1850s and 1860s later in life Vacherot had remorse over the growth of atheistic anticlericalism and returned to both Catholicism and monarchism receiving Catholic burial upon his death.

The Vacherot brothers André and Marcel both French tennis champions were grandsons of Étienne Vacherot.

Vacherot was a man of high character and adhered strictly to his principles which were generally opposed to those of the party in power. His chief philosophical importance consists in the fact that he was a leader in the attempt to revivify French philosophy by the new thought of Germany to which he had been introduced by Victor Cousin but of which he never had more than a second-hand knowledge. Metaphysics he held to be based on psychology. He maintains the unity and freedom of the soul and the absolute obligation of the moral law. In religion which was his main interest he was much influenced by Hegel and appears somewhat in the ambiguous position of a sceptic anxious to believe. He sees insoluble contradictions in every mode of conceiving God as real yet he advocates religious belief though the object of that belief have but an abstract or imaginary existence."
Paul Valéry,"Ambroise Paul Toussaint Jules Valéry was a French poet essayist and philosopher. In addition to his poetry and fiction his interests included aphorisms on art history letters music and current events. Valéry was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 12 different years.

Valéry was born to a Corsican father and Genoese-Istrian mother in Sète a town on the Mediterranean coast of the Hérault but he was raised in Montpellier a larger urban center close by. After a traditional Roman Catholic education he studied law at university and then resided in Paris for most of the remainder of his life where he was for a while part of the circle of Stéphane Mallarmé.

In 1900 he married Jeannine Gobillard a friend of Stéphane Mallarmés family who was also a niece of the painter Berthe Morisot. The wedding was a double ceremony in which the brides cousin Berthe Morisots daughter Julie Manet married the painter Ernest Rouart. Valéry and Gobillard had three children Claude Agathe and François.

Valéry served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to young French painters sculptors decorators engravers writers and musicians.

Though his earliest publications date from his mid-twenties Valéry did not become a full-time writer until 1920 when the man for whom he worked as private secretary a former chief executive of the Havas news agency Edouard Lebey died of Parkinsons disease. Until then Valéry had briefly earned his living at the Ministry of War before assuming the relatively flexible post as assistant to the increasingly impaired Lebey a job he held for some twenty years.

After his election to the Académie française in 1925 Valéry became a tireless public speaker and intellectual figure in French society touring Europe and giving lectures on cultural and social issues as well as assuming a number of official positions eagerly offered to him by an admiring French nation. He represented France on cultural matters at the League of Nations and he served on several of its committees including the sub-committee on Arts and Letters of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. The English-language collection The Outlook for Intelligence contains translations of a dozen essays related to these activities.

In 1931 he founded the Collège International de Cannes a private institution teaching French language and civilization. The Collège is still operating today offering professional courses for native speakers as well as courses for foreign students.

He gave the keynote address at the 1932 German national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Johann Wolfgang Goethe. This was a fitting choice as Valéry shared Goethes fascination with science .

In addition to his activities as a member of the Académie française he was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon and of the Front national des Ecrivains. In 1937 he was appointed chief executive of what later became the University of Nice. He was the inaugural holder of the Chair of Poetics at the Collège de France.

During World War II the Vichy regime stripped him of some of these jobs and distinctions because of his quiet refusal to collaborate with Vichy and the German occupation but Valéry continued throughout these troubled years to publish and to be active in French cultural life especially as a member of the Académie française.

Valéry died in Paris in 1945. He is buried in the cemetery of his native town Sète the same cemetery celebrated in his famous poem Le Cimetière marin.

Valéry is best known as a poet and he is sometimes considered to be the last of the French symbolists. However he published fewer than a hundred poems and none of them drew much attention. On the night of 4 October 1892 during a heavy storm Paul Valéry underwent an existential crisis an event that made a huge impact on his writing career. Eventually around 1898 he quit writing altogether publishing not a word for nearly twenty years. This hiatus was in part due to the death of his mentor Stéphane Mallarmé. When in 1917 he finally broke his great silence with the publication of La Jeune Parque he was forty-six years of age.

This obscure but sublimely musical masterpiece of 512 alexandrine lines in rhyming couplets had taken him four years to complete and it immediately secured his fame. With Le Cimetière marin and LÉbauche dun serpent it is often considered one of the greatest French poems of the twentieth century.

The title was chosen late in the poems gestation; it refers to the youngest of the three Parcae though for some readers the connection with that mythological figure is tenuous and problematic.

The poem is written in the first person and is the soliloquy of a young woman contemplating life and death engagement and withdrawal love and estrangement in a setting dominated by the sea the sky stars rocky cliffs and the rising sun. However it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe at the time of the poems composition. The poem is not about World War I but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty and in this sense it resonates with ancient Greek meditations on these matters especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are therefore evident links with le Cimetière marin which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.

Before la Jeune Parque Valérys only publications of note were dialogues articles some poems and a study of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1920 and 1922 he published two slim collections of verses. The first Album des vers anciens was a revision of early but beautifully wrought smaller poems some of which had been published individually before 1900. The second Charmes further confirmed his reputation as a major French poet. The collection includes le Cimetière marin and many smaller poems with diverse structures.

Valérys technique is quite orthodox in its essentials. His verse rhymes and scans in conventional ways and it has much in common with the work of Mallarmé. His poem Palme inspired James Merrills celebrated 1974 poem Lost in Translation and his cerebral lyricism also influenced the American poet Edgar Bowers.

Valéry described his true oeuvre to be prose and he filled more than 28000 notebook pages over his lifetime. His far more ample prose writings peppered with many aphorisms and bons mots reveal a skeptical outlook on human nature verging on the cynical. His view of state power was broadly liberal insofar as he believed that state power and infringements on the individual should be severely limited. Although he had flirted with nationalist ideas during the 1890s he moved away from them by 1899 and believed that European culture owed its greatness to the ethnic diversity and universalism of the Roman Empire. He denounced the myth of racial purity and argued that such purity if it existed would only lead to stagnationthus the mixing of races was necessary for progress and cultural development. In America as a Projection of the European Mind Valéry remarked that whenever he despaired about Europes situation he could restore some degree of hope only by thinking ofthe New World and mused on the happy variations which could result from European aesthetic ideas filtering into the powerful character of native Mexican art.

Raymond Poincaré Louis de Broglie André Gide Henri Bergson and Albert Einstein all respected Valérys thinking and became friendly correspondents. Valéry was often asked to write articles on topics not of his choosing; the resulting intellectual journalism was collected in five volumes titled Variétés.

Valérys most striking achievement is perhaps his monumental intellectual diary called the Cahiers . Early every morning of his adult life he contributed something to the Cahiers prompting him to write Having dedicated those hours to the life of the mind I thereby earn the right to be stupid for the rest of the day.

The subjects of his Cahiers entries often were surprisingly reflections on science and mathematics. In fact arcane topics in these domains appear to have commanded far more of his considered attention than his celebrated poetry. The Cahiers also contain the first drafts of many aphorisms he later included in his books. To date the Cahiers have been published in their entirety only as photostatic reproductions and only since 1980 have they begun to receive scholarly scrutiny. The Cahiers have been translated into English in five volumes published by Peter Lang with the title CahiersNotebooks.

In recent decades Valérys thought has been considered a touchstone in the field of constructivist epistemology as noted for instance by Jean-Louis Le Moigne in his description of constructivist history.

One of three epigraphs in Cormac McCarthys novel Blood Meridian is from Valérys Writing at the Yalu River 

In the book El laberinto de la soledad from Octavio Paz there are three verses of one of Valérys poems 

Je pense sur le bord doré de luniversA ce gout de périr qui prend la PythonisseEn qui mugit lespoir que le monde finisse.

Oscar-winning Japanese director Hayao Miyazakis 2013 film The Wind Rises and the Japanese novel of the same name take their title from Valérys verse Le vent se lève... il faut tenter de vivre in the poem Le Cimetière marin . The same quote is used in the closing sentences of Anthony Burgesss 1962 novel The Wanting Seed."
Augusto Vera,"Augusto Vera was an Italian philosopher who followed Hegels theories and translated many of his works.

Vera was born in Amelia in the province of Terni. He was educated in Rome and Paris and after teaching classics for some years in Geneva held chairs of philosophy in various colleges in France. He was a philosophy teacher at the Lycée Victor-Duruy and subsequently was professor in Strasbourg and in Paris. He left Paris after the coup detat of 1851 and spent nine years in England. Attaching himself with enthusiasm to Hegels system Vera became widely influential in spreading a knowledge of the Hegelian doctrine and became the chief representative of Italian Hegelianism.

Without any marked originality his writings are distinguished by lucidity of exposition and genuine philosophic spirit. In 1860 Vera returned to Italy where he was made professor of philosophy in the Royal Academy of Milan. In the following year he was transferred to Naples as professor of philosophy in the university of Naples upon Francesco de Sanctis invitation. His Prolusioni alla Storia della Filosofia and Lezioni sulla Filosofia della Storia were connected with his professorial work which was specially devoted to the history of philosophy and the philosophy of history. He kept his teaching position until his death in Naples.

It was during his studies with his cousin in Paris that he came to know about philosophy and through them he acquired knowledge of Hegelianism and it culminated during the events of the 1848-49 French revolution. In England he continued his studies of Hegelian philosophy. During his years in Naples he would maintain relationships with the Philosophical Society of Berlin which originally consisted of Hegelians and kept up to date with both the German and the French Hegelian literature. As a teacher he undertook the translation of Hegels Introduzione alla filosofia in French. A lot of his work on neo-Hegelian theories were undertaken with Bertrando Spaventa. Some works see the Italian Hegelian doctrine as having led to Italian Fascism.

He also published translations into French with commentaries of Hegels works"

Paul Virilio,"Paul Virilio was a French cultural theorist urbanist and aesthetic philosopher. He is best known for his writings about technology as it has developed in relation to speed and power with diverse references to architecture the arts the city and the military.

According to two biographers Virilio was a historian of warfare technology and photography a philosopher of architecture military strategy and cinema and a politically engaged provocative commentator on history terrorism mass media and human-machine relations.

Paul Virilio was born in Paris in 1932 to an Italian communist father and a Catholic Breton mother. He grew up in the northern coastal French region of Brittany. The Second World War made a big impression on him as the city of Nantes fell victim to the German blitzkrieg became a port for the German navy and was bombarded by British and American planes. The war was his university. After training at the École des métiers dart Virilio specialised in stained-glass artwork and worked alongside Henri Matisse in churches in Paris. In 1950 he converted to Christianity.

After being conscripted into the army during the Algerian War Virilio attended lectures in phenomenology by Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the Sorbonne.

In 1958 Virilio conducted a phenomenological inquiry into military space and the organization of territory particularly concerning the Atlantic Wall the 15000 Nazi bunkers built during the Second World War along the French coastline that were designed to repel any Allied assault. In 1963 he began to collaborate with the architect Claude Parent and formed the Architecture Principe group . After participating in the May 1968 uprising in Paris Virilio was nominated Professor by the students at the École Spéciale dArchitecture. In 1973 he became the director of studies. The same year Virilio became director of the magazine LEspace Critique.

In 1975 he was one of the organizers of the Bunker Archéologie exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs Paris which was a collection of texts and images relating to the Atlantic Wall. He has since been widely published translated and anthologised.

In 1998 Virilio began to teach intensive seminars at the European Graduate School. His final projects involved working with homeless groups in Paris and building the first Museum of the Accident.

Virilio developed what he called the war model of the modern city and of human society in general and is the inventor of the term dromology meaning the logic of speed that is the foundation of technological society. His major works include War and Cinema Speed and Politics and The Information Bomb in which he argues among many other things that military projects and technologies drive history. Like some other cultural theorists he rejects labels - including cultural theorist - yet he has been linked by others with post-structuralism and postmodernism. Some people describe Virilios work as being positioned in the realm of the hypermodern. He has repeatedly affirmed his links with phenomenology for example and offers humanist critiques of modernist art movements such as Futurism. Throughout his books the political and theological themes of anarchism pacifism and Catholicism reappear as central influences to his self-proclaimed marginal approach to the question of technology. His work has been compared to that of Marshall McLuhan Jean Baudrillard Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari Jean-François Lyotard Jacques Ellul and others. Virilio was also an urbanist. After having been a longtime resident of the city of Paris he moved to La Rochelle.

Virilios predictions about logistics of perception - the use of images and information in war - were so accurate that during the Gulf War he was invited to discuss his ideas with French military officers. Virilio argued that it was a world war in miniature.

Virilio believed that technology cannot exist without the potential for accidents. For example Virilio argued that the invention of the locomotive also contained the invention of derailment. He saw the Accident as a rather negative growth of social positivism and scientific progress. He believed the growth of technology namely television separates us directly from the events of real space and real time. In it he suggested we lose wisdom and sight of our immediate horizon and resort to the indirect horizon of our dissimulated environment. From this angle the Accident can be mentally pictured as a sort of fractal meteorite whose impact is prepared in the propitious darkness a landscape of events concealing future collisions. Aristotle claimed that there is no science of the accident but Virilio disagreed pointing to the growing credibility of simulators designed to escape the accident which he argued is an industry that is born from the unholy marriage of post-WW2 science and the military-industrial complex.

Dromos is an Ancient Greek noun for race or racetrack which Virilio applied the activity of racing . It is with this meaning in mind that he coined the term dromology which he defined as the science of speed. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He noted that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower. Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.

In contemporary warfare logistics does not just imply the movement of personnel tanks fuel and so on but also the movement of images both to and from the battlefield. Virilio talked a lot about the creation of CNN and the concept of the newshound. The newshound will capture images which will then be sent to CNN which may then be broadcast to the public. This movement of images can start a conflict . The logistics of perception relates also to the televising of military maneuvers and the images of conflict that are watched not only by people at home but also by the military personnel involved in the conflict. The field of battle also exists as a field of perception.

For Virilio the transition from feudalism to capitalism was driven not primarily by the politics of wealth and production techniques but by the mechanics of war. Virilio argued that the traditional feudal fortified city disappeared because of the increasing sophistication of weapons and possibilities for warfare. For Virilio the concept of siege warfare became rather a war of movement. In Speed and Politics he argues that history progresses at the speed of its weapons systems.

In an interview conducted by Bertrand Richard Virilio articulated his concept of an administration of fear which governs contemporary life together with a summary of his other philosophical views. The interview was later printed as a short book and translated into English . Virilio chose the phrase in reference to the title of Graham Greenes novel The Ministry of Fear a fictional account of the Blitz in London; Virilio himself had lived through the Blitzkrieg in France as a boy a formative event which informed his philosophy.

Based upon his experience as an urbanist Virilio stresses that fear has not only a psychological aspect but also a physical one which is closely related to speed. To underline the point he cites Hannah Arendt when she states in The Origins of Totalitarianism that Terror is the realization of the law of movement.; a simple example is the image of a gazelle running to escape a lion. For contemporary humanity fear is also related to speed which can be seen in scenarios such as a nuclear apocalypse or a stock market crash. Hypotheticals like these are governed by computers which act at speeds that are not tractable for humans. Virilio also contends that perpetual instantaneous communication via computers and the internet are disruptive to biological rhythms and historical seasonal patterns of life in human culture producing both fear and misery. As an example he cites an increase of suicides which occurred among France Télécom employees from 2009 to 2010. Virilio attributed the suicides to the organizations restructuring which required frequent relocation of employees and expectations of constant communication.

Virilio was one of the many cultural theorists criticized by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in 1997 for what they characterize as misunderstanding and misuse of science and mathematics. Virilios works are the subject of chapter 10 of Fashionable Nonsense. Their criticism consists of a series of quotes from Virilios works and then explanations of how Virilio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology to the point of absurdity. In the authors words

Voltaire,"François-Marie Arouet was a French Enlightenment writer historian and philosopher famous for his wit his criticism of Christianityespecially the Roman Catholic Churchas well as his advocacy of freedom of speech freedom of religion and separation of church and state.

Voltaire was a versatile and prolific writer producing works in almost every literary form including plays poems novels essays histories and scientific expositions. He wrote more than 20000 letters and 2000 books and pamphlets. He was one of the first authors to become renowned and commercially successful internationally. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties and was at constant risk from the strict censorship laws of the Catholic French monarchy. His polemics witheringly satirized intolerance religious dogma and the French institutions of his day.

François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris the youngest of the five children of François Arouet a lawyer who was a minor treasury official and his wife Marie Marguerite Daumard whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility. Some speculation surrounds Voltaires date of birth because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman Guérin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune. Two of his older brothersArmand-François and Robertdied in infancy and his surviving brother Armand and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older respectively. Nicknamed Zozo by his family Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694 with François de Castagnère abbé de Châteauneuf and Marie Daumard the wife of his mothers cousin standing as godparents. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Collège Louis-le-Grand where he was taught Latin theology and rhetoric; later in life he became fluent in Italian Spanish and English.

By the time he left school Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer against the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a lawyer. Voltaire pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out he sent Voltaire to study law this time in Caen Normandy. But the young man continued to write producing essays and historical studies. Voltaires wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed. In 1713 his father obtained a job for him as a secretary to the new French ambassador in the Netherlands the marquis de Châteauneuf the brother of Voltaires godfather. At The Hague Voltaire fell in love with a French Protestant refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer . Their affair considered scandalous was discovered by de Châteauneuf and Voltaire was forced to return to France by the end of the year.

Most of Voltaires early life revolved around Paris. From early on Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. As a result he was twice sentenced to prison and once to temporary exile to England. One satirical verse in which Voltaire accused the Régent of incest with his daughter resulted in an eleven-month imprisonment in the Bastille. The Comédie-Française had agreed in January 1717 to stage his debut play Œdipe and it opened in mid-November 1718 seven months after his release. Its immediate critical and financial success established his reputation. Both the Régent and King George I of Great Britain presented Voltaire with medals as a mark of their appreciation.

He mainly argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. He campaigned to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority and supported a constitutional monarchy that protects peoples rights.

Arouet adopted the name Voltaire in 1718 following his incarceration at the Bastille. Its origin is unclear. It is an anagram of AROVET LI the Latinized spelling of his surname Arouet and the initial letters of le jeune . According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister he was known as le petit volontaire as a child and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life. The name also reverses the syllables of Airvault his familys home town in the Poitou region.

Richard Holmes supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as voltige volte-face and volatile . Arouet was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation especially given that names resonance with à rouer and roué .

In a letter to Jean-Baptiste Rousseau in March 1719 Voltaire concludes by asking that if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains Jai été si malheureux sous le nom dArouet que jen ai pris un autre surtout pour nêtre plus confondu avec le poète Roi This probably refers to Adenes le Roi and the oi diphthong was then pronounced like modern ouai so the similarity to Arouet is clear and thus it could well have been part of his rationale. Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime.

Voltaires next play Artémire set in ancient Macedonia opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only fragments of the text survive. He instead turned to an epic poem about Henry IV of France that he had begun in early 1717. Denied a licence to publish in August 1722 Voltaire headed north to find a publisher outside France. On the journey he was accompanied by his mistress Marie-Marguerite de Rupelmonde a young widow.

At Brussels Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague. In the Netherlands Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society. On his return to France he secured a second publisher in Rouen who agreed to publish La Henriade clandestinely. After Voltaires recovery from a month-long smallpox infection in November 1723 the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed. While the poem was an instant success Voltaires new play Mariamne was a failure when it first opened in March 1724. Heavily reworked it opened at the Comédie-Française in April 1725 to a much-improved reception. It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczyńska in September 1725.

In early 1726 the aristocratic chevalier de Rohan-Chabot taunted Voltaire about his change of name and Voltaire retorted that his name would win the esteem of the world while de Rohan would sully his own. The furious de Rohan arranged for his thugs to beat up Voltaire a few days later. Seeking redress Voltaire challenged de Rohan to a duel but the powerful de Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned without trial in the Bastille on 17 April 1726. Fearing indefinite imprisonment Voltaire asked to be exiled to England as an alternative punishment which the French authorities accepted. On 2 May he was escorted from the Bastille to Calais and embarked for Britain.

In England Voltaire lived largely in Wandsworth with acquaintances including Everard Fawkener. From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged at Maiden Lane Covent Garden now commemorated by a plaque to be nearer to his British publisher. Voltaire circulated throughout English high society meeting Alexander Pope John Gay Jonathan Swift Lady Mary Wortley Montagu Sarah Duchess of Marlborough and many other members of the nobility and royalty. Voltaires exile in Great Britain greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britains constitutional monarchy in contrast to French absolutism and by the countrys greater freedom of speech and religion. He was influenced by the writers of the time and developed an interest in English literature especially Shakespeare who was still little known in continental Europe. Despite pointing out Shakespeares deviations from neoclassical standards Voltaire saw him as an example for French drama which though more polished lacked on-stage action. Later however as Shakespeares influence began growing in France Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays decrying what he considered Shakespeares barbarities. Voltaire may have been present at the funeral of Isaac Newton and met Newtons niece Catherine Conduitt. In 1727 he published two essays in English Upon the Civil Wars of France Extracted from Curious Manuscripts and Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations from Homer Down to Milton.

After two and a half years in exile Voltaire returned to France and after a few months in Dieppe the authorities permitted him to return to Paris. At a dinner French mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts and Voltaire joined the consortium earning perhaps a million livres. He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the Court of Finances of his responsible conduct allowing him to take control of a trust fund inherited from his father. He was now indisputably rich.

Further success followed in 1732 with his play Zaïre which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener praising English liberty and commerce. He published his admiring essays on British government literature religion and science in Letters Concerning the English Nation . In 1734 they were published in Rouen as Lettres philosophiques causing a huge scandal. Published without approval of the royal censor the essays lauded British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights than its French counterpart particularly regarding religious tolerance. The book was publicly burnt and banned and Voltaire was again forced to flee Paris.

In 1733 Voltaire met Émilie du Châtelet a mathematician and married mother of three who was 12 years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for 16 years. To avoid arrest after the publication of Lettres Voltaire took refuge at her husbands château at Cirey on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine. Voltaire paid for the buildings renovation and Émilies husband sometimes stayed at the château with his wife and her lover. The intellectual paramours collected around 21000 books an enormous number for the time. Together they studied these books and performed scientific experiments at Cirey including an attempt to determine the nature of fire.

Having learned from his previous brushes with the authorities Voltaire began his habit of avoiding open confrontation with the authorities and denying any awkward responsibility. He continued to write plays such as Mérope and began his long researches into science and history. Again a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile during which he had been strongly influenced by the works of Isaac Newton. Voltaire strongly believed in Newtons theories; he performed experiments in optics at Cirey and was one of the promulgators of the famous story of Newtons inspiration from the falling apple which he had learned from Newtons niece in London and first mentioned in his Letters.

In the fall of 1735 Voltaire was visited by Francesco Algarotti who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian. Partly inspired by the visit the Marquise translated Newtons Latin Principia into French which remained the definitive French version into the 21st century. Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz a contemporary and rival of Newton. While Voltaire remained a firm Newtonian the Marquise adopted certain aspects of Leibnizs critiques. Voltaires own book Elements of the Philosophy of Newton made the great scientist accessible to a far greater public and the Marquise wrote a celebratory review in the Journal des savants. Voltaires work was instrumental in bringing about general acceptance of Newtons optical and gravitational theories in France in contrast to the theories of Descartes.

Voltaire and the Marquise also studied history particularly the great contributors to civilization. Voltaires second essay in English had been Essay upon the Civil Wars in France. It was followed by La Henriade an epic poem on the French King Henri IV glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the Edict of Nantes which established religious toleration. There followed a historical novel on King Charles XII of Sweden. These along with his Letters on the English mark the beginning of Voltaires open criticism of intolerance and established religions. Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy particularly metaphysical questions concerning the existence of God and the soul. Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible and concluded that much of its content was dubious. Voltaires critical views on religion led to his belief in separation of church and state and religious freedom ideas that he had formed after his stay in England.

In August 1736 Frederick the Great then Crown Prince of Prussia and a great admirer of Voltaire initiated a correspondence with him. That December Voltaire moved to Holland for two months and became acquainted with the scientists Herman Boerhaave and s Gravesande. From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels at first with the Marquise who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in Limburg. In July 1740 he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher van Duren from printing without permission Fredericks Anti-Machiavel. In September Voltaire and Frederick met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleves and in November Voltaire was Fredericks guest in Berlin for two weeks followed by a meeting in September 1742 at Aix-la-Chapelle. Voltaire was sent to Fredericks court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Fredericks military intentions in the War of the Austrian Succession.

Though deeply committed to the Marquise Voltaire by 1744 found life at her château confining. On a visit to Paris that year he found a new lovehis niece. At first his attraction to Marie Louise Mignot was clearly sexual as evidenced by his letters to her . Much later they lived together perhaps platonically and remained together until Voltaires death. Meanwhile the Marquise also took a lover the Marquis de Saint-Lambert.

After the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749 Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in mid-1750 moved to Prussia at the invitation of Frederick the Great. The Prussian king made him a chamberlain in his household appointed him to the Order of Merit and gave him a salary of 20000 French livres a year. He had rooms at Sanssouci and Charlottenburg Palace. Life went well for Voltaire at first and in 1751 he completed Micromégas a piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind. However his relationship with Frederick began to deteriorate after he was accused of theft and forgery by a Jewish financier Abraham Hirschel who had invested in Saxon government bonds on behalf of Voltaire at a time when Frederick was involved in sensitive diplomatic negotiations with Saxony.

He encountered other difficulties an argument with Maupertuis the president of the Berlin Academy of Science and a former rival for Émilies affections provoked Voltaires Diatribe du docteur Akakia which satirized some of Maupertuiss theories and his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance Johann Samuel König. This greatly angered Frederick who ordered all copies of the document burned. On 1 January 1752 Voltaire offered to resign as chamberlain and return his insignia of the Order of Merit; at first Frederick refused until eventually permitting Voltaire to leave in March. On a slow journey back to France Voltaire stayed at Leipzig and Gotha for a month each and Kassel for two weeks arriving at Frankfurt on 31 May. The following morning he was detained at an inn by Fredericks agents who held him in the city for over three weeks while Voltaire and Frederick argued by letter over the return of a satirical book of poetry Frederick had lent to Voltaire. Marie Louise joined him on 9 June. She and her uncle only left Frankfurt in July after she had defended herself from the unwanted advances of one of Fredericks agents and Voltaires luggage had been ransacked and valuable items taken.

Voltaires attempts to vilify Frederick for his agents actions at Frankfurt were largely unsuccessful including his Mémoires pour Servir à la Vie de M. de Voltaire published posthumously. However the correspondence between them continued and though they never met in person again after the Seven Years War they largely reconciled.

Voltaires slow progress toward Paris continued through Mainz Mannheim Strasbourg and Colmar but in January 1754 Louis XV banned him from Paris and he turned for Geneva near which he bought a large estate in early 1755. Though he was received openly at first the law in Geneva which banned theatrical performances and the publication of The Maid of Orleans against his will soured his relationship with Calvinist Genevans. In late 1758 he bought an even larger estate at Ferney on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border. The town would adopt his name calling itself Ferney-Voltaire and this became its official name in 1878.

Early in 1759 Voltaire completed and published Candide ou lOptimisme . This satire on Leibnizs philosophy of optimistic determinism remains Voltaires best-known work. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life frequently entertaining distinguished guests such as James Boswell Adam Smith Giacomo Casanova and Edward Gibbon. In 1764 he published one of his best-known philosophical works the Dictionnaire philosophique a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas a few of which were originally written in Berlin.

From 1762 as an unmatched intellectual celebrity he began to champion unjustly persecuted individuals most famously the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas. Calas had been tortured to death in 1763 supposedly because he had murdered his eldest son for wanting to convert to Catholicism. His possessions were confiscated and his two daughters were taken from his widow and forced into Catholic convents. Voltaire seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution managed to overturn the conviction in 1765.

Voltaire was initiated into Freemasonry a little over a month before his death. On 4 April 1778 he attended la Loge des Neuf Sœurs in Paris and became an Entered Apprentice Freemason. According to some sources Benjamin Franklin... urged Voltaire to become a freemason; and Voltaire agreed perhaps only to please Franklin. However Franklin was merely a visitor at the time Voltaire was initiated the two only met a month before Voltaires death and their interactions with each other were brief.

In February 1778 Voltaire returned for the first time in over 25 years to Paris among other reasons to see the opening of his latest tragedy Irene. The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old and he believed he was about to die on 28 February writing I die adoring God loving my friends not hating my enemies and detesting superstition. However he recovered and in March he saw a performance of Irene where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero.

He soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites from a Catholic priest or that he died in agony of body and soul while his adherents told of his defiance to his last breath. According to one story of his last words when the priest urged him to renounce Satan he replied This is no time to make new enemies. However this appears to have originated from a joke in a Massachusetts newspaper in 1856 and was only attributed to Voltaire in the 1970s.

Because of his well-known criticism of the Church which he had refused to retract before his death Voltaire was denied a Christian burial in Paris but friends and relations managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of Scellières in Champagne where Marie Louises brother was abbé. His heart and brain were embalmed separately.

On 11 July 1791 the National Assembly of France regarding Voltaire as a forerunner of the French Revolution had his remains brought back to Paris and enshrined in the Panthéon. An estimated million people attended the procession which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony including music composed for the event by André Grétry.

Voltaire had an enormous influence on the development of historiography through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues

Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.

Voltaires best-known histories are History of Charles XII The Age of Louis XIV and his Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations . He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events and emphasized customs social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The Essay on Customs traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by Bossuets Discourse on Universal History he was the first scholar to attempt seriously a history of the world eliminating theological frameworks and emphasizing economics culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record he fervently believed reason and expanding literacy would lead to progress.

Voltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on History in Diderots Encyclopédie One demands of modern historians more details better ascertained facts precise dates more attention to customs laws mores commerce finance agriculture population. Voltaires histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism Eurocentrism religious intolerance and a concentration on great men diplomacy and warfare. Yale professor Peter Gay says Voltaire wrote very good history citing his scrupulous concern for truths careful sifting of evidence intelligent selection of what is important keen sense of drama and grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study.

From an early age Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems including the first ever written in French the Henriade and later The Maid of Orleans besides many other smaller pieces.

The Henriade was written in imitation of Virgil using the alexandrine couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. La Pucelle on the other hand is a burlesque on the legend of Joan of Arc.

Many of Voltaires prose works and romances usually composed as pamphlets were written as polemics. Candide attacks the passivity inspired by Leibnizs philosophy of optimism through the character Panglosss frequent refrain that circumstances are the best of all possible worlds. LHomme aux quarante ecus addresses social and political ways of the time; Zadig and others the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works Voltaires ironic style free of exaggeration is apparent particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment.Candide in particular is the best example of his style. Voltaire also hasin common with Jonathan Swiftthe distinction of paving the way for science fictions philosophical irony particularly in his Micromégas and the vignette Platos Dream .

In general his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaires other works. Almost all of his more substantive works whether in verse or prose are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the Commentaire sur Corneille although he wrote many more similar workssometimes independently and sometimes as part of his Siècles.

Voltaires works especially his private letters frequently urge the reader écrasez linfâme or crush the infamous. The phrase refers to contemporaneous abuses of power by royal and religious authorities and the superstition and intolerance fomented by the clergy. He had seen and felt these effects in his own exiles the burnings of his books and those of many others and in the atrocious persecution of Jean Calas and François-Jean de la Barre. He stated in one of his most famous quotes that Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them.

The most oft-cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it. These were not his words but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book The Friends of Voltaire. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaires attitude towards Claude Adrien Helvétius and his controversial book De lesprit but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaires attitude towards Helvetius; it had been said Halls summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche in which he was reported to have said I detest what you write but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write. Nevertheless scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.

Voltaires first major philosophical work in his battle against linfâme was the Traité sur la tolérance exposing the Calas affair along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras . Then in his Dictionnaire philosophique containing such articles as Abraham Genesis Church Council he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets Voltaire criticized Frances colonial policy in North America dismissing the vast territory of New France as a few acres of snow .

Voltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life totalling over 20000 letters. Theodore Bestermans collected edition of these letters completed only in 1964 fills 102 volumes. One historian called the letters a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship humane feeling and incisive thought.

In Voltaires correspondence with Catherine the Great he derided democracy. He wrote Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude.

Like other key Enlightenment thinkers Voltaire was a deist. He challenged orthodoxy by asking What is faith Is it to believe that which is evident No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary eternal supreme and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith but of reason.

In a 1763 essay Voltaire supported the toleration of other religions and ethnicities It does not require great art or magnificently trained eloquence to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I however am going further I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What The Turk my brother The Chinaman my brother The Jew The Siam Yes without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God

In one of his many denunciations of priests of every religious sect Voltaire describes them as those who rise from an incestuous bed manufacture a hundred versions of God then eat and drink God then piss and shit God.

Historians have described Voltaires description of the history of Christianity as propagandistic. His Dictionnaire philosophique is responsible for the myth that the early Church had fifty gospels before settling on the standard canonical four as well as propagating the myth that the canon of the New Testament was decided at the First Council of Nicaea. Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church Fathers. Furthermore despite the death of Hypatia being the result of finding herself in the crossfires of a mob during a political feud in 4th century Alexandria Voltaire promoted the theory that she was stripped naked and murdered by the minions of the bishop Cyril of Alexandria concluding by stating that when one finds a beautiful woman completely naked it is not for the purpose of massacring her. Voltaire meant for this argument to bolster one of his anti-Catholic tracts. In a letter to Frederick II King of Prussia dated 5 January 1767 he wrote about Christianity

La nôtre is assuredly the most ridiculous the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition I do not say among the rabble who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people among men who think among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out.

It is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves God killed so I must kill; Abraham lied Jacob deceived Rachel stole so I must steal deceive lie. But wretch you are neither Rachel nor Jacob nor Abraham nor God; you are just a mad fool and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise.

As Christianity advances disasters befall the empirearts science literature decaybarbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumphand the unwary reader is conducted with matchless dexterity to the desired conclusionthe abominable Manicheism of Candide and in fact of all the productions of Voltaires historic schoolviz. that instead of being a merciful ameliorating and benignant visitation the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil.

However Voltaire also acknowledged the self-sacrifice of Christians. He wrote Perhaps there is nothing greater on earth than the sacrifice of youth and beauty often of high birth made by the gentle sex in order to work in hospitals for the relief of human misery the sight of which is so revolting to our delicacy. Peoples separated from the Roman religion have imitated but imperfectly so generous a charity. Yet according to Daniel-Rops Voltaires hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack launched at first against clericalism and theocracy ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture the dogmas of the Church and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself who depicted now as a degenerate. Voltaires reasoning may be summed up in his well-known saying Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.

According to Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin the most significant Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire; thirty of the 118 articles in his Dictionnaire philosophique dealt with Jews and described them in consistently negative ways. For example in Voltaires A Philosophical Dictionary he wrote of Jews In short we find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched.

On the other hand Peter Gay a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment also points to Voltaires remarks in the Traité sur la tolérance and surmises that Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity. Whatever anti-semitism Voltaire may have felt Gay suggests derived from negative personal experience. Bertram Schwarzbachs far more detailed studies of Voltaires dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti-biblical not anti-semitic. His remarks on the Jews and their superstitions were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians.

Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews.Arthur Hertzberg claims that Gays second suggestion is also untenable as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians.

Some authors link Voltaires anti-Judaism to his polygenism. According to Joxe Azurmendi this anti-Judaism has a relative importance in Voltaires philosophy of history. However Voltaires anti-Judaism influences later authors like Ernest Renan. Although Voltaire did have a Jewish friend Daniel de Fonseca whom he called the only philosopher of his people.

According to the historian Will Durant Voltaire had initially condemned the persecution of Jews on several occasions including in his work Henriade. As stated by Durant Voltaire had praised the simplicity sobriety regularity and industry of Jews. However subsequently Voltaire had become strongly anti-Semitic after some regrettable personal financial transactions and quarrels with Jewish financiers. In his Essai sur les moeurs Voltaire had denounced the ancient Hebrews using strong language; a Catholic priest had protested against this censure. The anti-Semitic passages in Voltaires Dictionnaire philosophique were criticized by Issac Pinto in 1762. Subsequently Voltaire agreed with the criticism of his anti-Semitic views and stated that he had been wrong to attribute to a whole nation the vices of some individuals; he also promised to revise the objectionable passages for forthcoming editions of the Dictionnaire philosophique but failed to do so.

Voltaires views about Islam were generally negative and he found its holy book the Quran to be ignorant of the laws of physics. In a 1740 letter to Frederick II of Prussia Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that is assuredly nothing any man can excuse and suggests that his following stemmed from superstition; Voltaire continued But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven where he received in part this unintelligible book each page of which makes common sense shudder; that to pay homage to this book he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse at least if he was not born a Turk or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him.

In 1748 after having read Henri de Boulainvilliers and George Sale he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in De lAlcoran et de Mahomet . In this essay Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a sublime charlatan Drawing on complementary information in Herbelots Oriental Library Voltaire according to René Pomeau adjudged the Quran with its contradictions ... absurdities ... anachronisms to be rhapsody without connection without order and without art. Thus he henceforward conceded that if his book was bad for our times and for us it was very good for his contemporaries and his religion even more so. It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry and that it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion taught by a man who was constantly victorious could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth. He considered that its civil laws are good; its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours but that his means are shocking; deception and murder.

In his Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations Voltaire deals with the history of Europe before Charlemagne to the dawn of the age of Louis XIV and that of the colonies and the East. As a historian he devoted several chapters to Islam Voltaire highlighted the Arabian Turkish courts and conducts. Here he called Mohammed a poet and stated that he was not an illiterate. As a legislator he changed the face of part of Europe one half of Asia. In chapter VI Voltaire finds similarities between Arabs and ancient Hebrews that they both kept running to battle in the name of God and sharing a passion for the spoils of war. Voltaire continues that It is to be believed that Mohammed like all enthusiasts violently struck by his ideas first presented them in good faith strengthened them with fantasy fooled himself in fooling others and supported through necessary deceptions a doctrine which he considered good. He thus compares the genius of the Arab people with the genius of the ancient Romans.

According to Malise Ruthven as Voltaire learned more about Islam his opinion of the faith became more positive. As a result his book Fanaticism inspired Goethe who was attracted to Islam to write a drama on this theme though completed only the poem Mahomets-Gesang .

The tragedy Fanaticism or Mahomet the Prophet was written in 1736 by Voltaire. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation. The character Muhammad orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect.

Voltaire described Muhammad as an impostor a false prophet a fanatic and a hypocrite. Defending the play Voltaire said that he tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism led by an impostor can plunge weak minds. When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to César de Missy he described Mohammed as deceitful.

In his play Mohammed was whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command. After later having judged that he had made Mohammed in his play somewhat nastier than he really was Voltaire claims that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians who are often referred to as Magi. Voltaire continues about Islam saying

Nothing is more terrible than a people who having nothing to lose fight in the united spirit of rapine and of religion.

In a 1745 letter recommending the play to Pope Benedict XIV Voltaire described Muhammad as the founder of a false and barbarous sect and a false prophet. Voltaire wrote Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful though a zealous admirer of virtue of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy His view was modified slightly for Essai sur les Moeurs et lEsprit des Nations although it remained negative. In 1751 Voltaire performed his play Mohamet once again with great success.

The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East.

He regarded Hindus as a peaceful and innocent people equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves. Voltaire was himself a supporter of animal rights and was a vegetarian. He used the antiquity of Hinduism to land what he saw as a devastating blow to the Bibles claims and acknowledged that the Hindus treatment of animals showed a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists.

The works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit missionaries stationed in China.Matteo Ricci was among the earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687.

Translations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Western civilization. Voltaire was also influenced by Confucius seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma. He praised Confucian ethics and politics portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.

Confucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived...

With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West who saw it as an alternative to the traditional Ancien Régime of Europe. Voltaire wrote favourably of the idea claiming that the Chinese had perfected moral science and advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.

Voltaire rejected the biblical Adam and Eve story and was a polygenist who speculated that each race had entirely separate origins. According to William Cohen like most other polygenists Voltaire believed that because of their different origins blacks did not entirely share the natural humanity of whites. According to David Allen Harvey Voltaire often invoked racial differences as a means to attack religious orthodoxy and the Biblical account of creation.

His most famous remark on slavery is found in Candide where the hero is horrified to learn at what price we eat sugar in Europe after coming across a slave in French Guiana who has been mutilated for escaping who opines that if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught it makes them cousins concluding that no one could treat their relatives more horribly. Elsewhere he wrote caustically about whites and Christians proceed to purchase negroes cheaply in order to sell them dear in America. Voltaire has been accused of supporting the slave trade as per a letter attributed to him although it has been suggested that this letter is a forgery since no satisfying source attests to the letters existence.

In his Philosophical Dictionary Voltaire endorses Montesquieus criticism of the slave trade Montesquieu was almost always in error with the learned because he was not learned but he was almost always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery.

Zeev Sternhell argues that despite his shortcomings Voltaire was a forerunner of liberal pluralism in his approach to history and non-European cultures. Voltaire wrote We have slandered the Chinese because their metaphysics is not the same as ours... This great misunderstanding about Chinese rituals has come about because we have judged their usages by ours for we carry the prejudices of our contentious spirit to the end of the world. In speaking of Persia he condemned Europes ignorant audacity and ignorant credulity. When writing about India he declares It is time for us to give up the shameful habit of slandering all sects and insulting all nations In Essai sur les mœurs et lesprit des nations he defended the integrity of the Native Americans and wrote favorably of the Inca Empire.

According to Victor Hugo To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century.Goethe regarded Voltaire as the greatest literary figure of modern times and possibly of all time. According to Diderot Voltaires influence would extend far into the future.Napoleon commented that till he was sixteen he would have fought for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire today it is the opposite... The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always reasonable never a charlatan never a fanatic .Frederick the Great commented on his good fortune for having lived in the age of Voltaire and corresponded with him throughout his reign until Voltaires death. In England Voltaires views influenced Godwin Paine Mary Wollstonecraft Bentham Byron and Shelley.Macaulay made note of the fear that Voltaires very name incited in tyrants and fanatics.

In Russia Catherine the Great had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762. In October 1763 she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death. The content of these letters has been described as being akin to a student writing to a teacher. Upon Voltaires death the Empress purchased his library which was then transported and placed in The Hermitage.Alexander Herzen remarked that The writings of the egoist Voltaire did more for liberation than those of the loving Rousseau did for brotherhood. In his famous letter to N. V. Gogol Vissarion Belinsky wrote that Voltaire stamped out the fires of fanaticism and ignorance in Europe by ridicule.

In his native Paris Voltaire was remembered as the defender of Jean Calas and Pierre Sirven. Although Voltaires campaign had failed to secure the annulment of la Barres execution for blasphemy against Christianity the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaires lifetime. In 1764 Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont arrested for attending Protestant services. When Comte de Lally was executed for treason in 1766 Voltaire wrote a 300-page document in his defense. Subsequently in 1778 the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaires death. The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire You seem to attack Christianity and yet you do the work of a Christian.Frederick the Great noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian.

Under the French Third Republic anarchists and socialists often invoked Voltaires writings in their struggles against militarism nationalism and the Catholic Church. The section condemning the futility and imbecility of war in the Dictionnaire philosophique was a frequent favorite as were his arguments that nations can only grow at the expense of others. Following the liberation of France from the Vichy regime in 1944 Voltaires 250th birthday was celebrated in both France and the Soviet Union honoring him as one of the most feared opponents of the Nazi collaborators and someone whose name symbolizes freedom of thought and hatred of prejudice superstition and injustice.

Jorge Luis Borges stated that not to admire Voltaire is one of the many forms of stupidity and included his short fiction such as Micromégas in The Library of Babel and A Personal Library.Gustave Flaubert believed that France had erred gravely by not following the path forged by Voltaire instead of Rousseau. Most architects of modern America were adherents of Voltaires views. According to Will Durant

Italy had a Renaissance and Germany had a Reformation but France had Voltaire; he was for his country both Renaissance and Reformation and half the Revolution. He was first and best in his time in his conception and writing of history in the grace of his poetry in the charm and wit of his prose in the range of his thought and his influence. His spirit moved like a flame over the continent and the century and stirs a million souls in every generation.

Voltaires junior contemporary Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented on how Voltaires book Letters on the English played a great role in his intellectual development. Having written some literary works and also some music in December 1745 Rousseau wrote a letter introducing himself to Voltaire who was by then the most prominent literary figure in France to which Voltaire replied with a polite response. Subsequently when Rousseau sent Voltaire a copy of his book Discourse on Inequality Voltaire replied noting his disagreement with the views expressed in the book

No one has ever employed so much intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is seized with a desire to walk on all fours . However as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit I feel unfortunately that it is impossible for me to resume it.

Subsequently commenting on Rousseaus romantic novel Julie or the New Heloise Voltaire stated

No more about Jean-Jacques romance if you please. I have read it to my sorrow and it would be to his if I had time to say what I think of this silly book.

Voltaire quipped that the first half of Julie had been written in a brothel and the second half in a lunatic asylum. In his Lettres sur La Nouvelle Heloise written under a pseudonym Voltaire criticized Rousseaus grammatical mistakes

Paris recognized Voltaires hand and judged the patriarch to be bitten by jealousy.

In reviewing Rousseaus book Emile Voltaire dismissed it as a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes with forty pages against Christianity among the boldest ever known. He expressed admiration for the section titled Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar calling it fifty good pages... it is regrettable that they should have been written by... such a knave. He went on to predict that Emile would be forgotten within a month.

In 1764 Rousseau published Lettres de la montagne on religion and politics. In the fifth letter he wondered why Voltaire had not been able to imbue the Genevan councilors who frequently met him with that spirit of tolerance which he preaches without cease and of which he sometimes has need. The letter continued with an imaginary speech in the voice of Voltaire acknowledging authorship of the heretical book Sermon of the Fifty which the real Voltaire had repeatedly denied.

In 1772 when a priest sent Rousseau a pamphlet denouncing Voltaire Rousseau responded by defending his rival

He has said and done so many good things that we should draw the curtain over his irregularities.

In 1778 when Voltaire was given unprecedented honors at the Théâtre-Français an acquaintance of Rousseau ridiculed the event. This was met by a sharp retort from Rousseau

How dare you mock the honors rendered to Voltaire in the temple of which he is the god and by the priests who for fifty years have been living off his masterpieces

On 2 July 1778 Rousseau died one month after Voltaire. In October 1794 Rousseaus remains were moved to the Panthéon near the remains of Voltaire.

Louis XVI while incarcerated in the Temple lamented that Rousseau and Voltaire had destroyed France.

Voltaire perceived the French bourgeoisie to be too small and ineffective the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt the commoners as ignorant and superstitious and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings although all too often even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses. Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy and that it was in the kings rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works his novella Candide ou lOptimisme which ends with a new conclusion of quietism It is up to us to cultivate our garden. His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. Candide was also burned and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain Demad in a letter where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.

He is remembered and honored in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the Ancien Régime. The Ancien Régime involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three Estates clergy and nobles on one side the commoners and middle class who were burdened with most of the taxes on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the Chinese philosopher Confucius.

Voltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms such as Si Dieu nexistait pas il faudrait linventer contained in a verse epistle from 1768 addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on The Three Impostors. But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as dHolbach Grimm and others.

He has had his detractors among his later colleagues. The Scottish Victorian writer Thomas Carlyle argued that Voltaire read history not with the eye of devout seer or even critic but through a pair of mere anti-catholic spectacles.

The town of Ferney where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life was officially named Ferney-Voltaire in honor of its most famous resident in 1878. His château is a museum. Voltaires library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg. In the Zurich of 1916 the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde Dada movement named their theater the Cabaret Voltaire. A late-20th-century industrial music group later adopted the same name. Astronomers have bestowed his name on the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire.

Voltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee as he was reported to have drunk it 5072 times per day. It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine stimulated his creativity. His great-grand-niece was the mother of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin a Catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest. His book Candide was listed as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written by Martin Seymour-Smith.

In the 1950s the bibliographer and translator Theodore Besterman started to collect transcribe and publish all of Voltaires writings. He founded the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva where he began publishing collected volumes of Voltaires correspondence. On his death in 1976 he left his collection to the University of Oxford where the Voltaire Foundation became established as a department. The Foundation has continued to publish the Complete Works of Voltaire a complete chronological series expected to reach completion in 2018 with around 200 volumes fifty years after the series began. It also publishes the series Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment begun by Bestermann as Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century which has reached more than 500 volumes.

Voltaire wrote between fifty and sixty plays including a few unfinished ones. Among them are

Yet...he never for a moment supposed that in this splendid outburst all France would accept enthusiastically the philosophy of this queer Jean-Jacques Rousseau who from Geneva and Paris was thrilling the world with sentimental romances and revolutionary pamphlets. The complex soul of France seemed to have divided itself into these two men so different and yet so French. Nietzsche speaks of la gaya scienza the light feet wit fire grace strong logic arrogant intellectuality the dance of the starssurely he was thinking of Voltaire. Now beside Voltaire put Rousseau all heat and fantasy a man with noble and jejune visions the idol of la bourgeois gentile-femme announcing like Pascal that the heart has its reason which the head can never understand."
Jean-Pierre Voyer,Jean-Pierre Voyer is a post-situationist French philosopher. His main thesis is the non-existence of economy and he claims to be inspired by Hegel and Marx although he is very critical of the latter. He criticizes utilitarianism. Jorion has also published in the Revue de Mauss a French anti-utilitarian journal.
Jules Vuillemin,"Jules Vuillemin was a French philosopher Professor of Philosophy of Knowledge at the prestigious Collège de France in Paris from 1962 to 1990 succeeding Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Professor emeritus from 1991 to 2001. He was an Invited Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton New Jersey .

At the Collège de France Vuillemin introduced analytical philosophy to France. Vuillemins thought had a major influence on Jacques Bouveresses works. Vuillemin himself vindicated the legacy of Martial Gueroult.

A friend of Michel Foucault he supported his election at the Collège de France and was also close to Michel Serres.

After studying at the Ecole Normale Supérieure he completed his agrégation in 1943 being received premier ex aequo alongside Tran Duc Thao. A student of French historical epistemologists Gaston Bachelard and Jean Cavaillès he was however at first influenced by phenomenology and existentialism before shifting towards study of logics and science. In 1962 he published a book titled The Philosophy of Algebra dedicated to the mathematician Pierre Samuel a member of the Bourbaki group as well as to René Thom to the physicist Raymond Siestrunck and to the linguist George Vallet. Vuillemin thought that renewals of methods in mathematics have influenced philosophy thus relating the discovery of irrational numbers to Platonism algebraic geometry to Cartesianism infinitesimal calculus to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Furthermore he observed that philosophy had not yet taken into account the changes brought to mathematics by Joseph Louis Lagrange and Évariste Galois.

In 1968 he co-founded with Gilles-Gaston Granger the journal LÂge de la Science. He was one of the main commentators of Bertrand Russell Ludwig Wittgenstein Rudolf Carnap and Willard Van Orman Quine in France.

Vuillemin also took an interest into aesthetics beside writing several books on Kant Anselm or on Diodoruss master argument .

The Jules Vuillemins Archives are located in France at the Laboratoire dHistoire des Sciences et de Philosophie - Archives Henri Poincaré.

Gilles-Gaston Granger was until his death in 2016 the president of the scientific committee of Jules Vuillemins Archives."
Charles Waddington (philosopher),Charles-Pendrell Waddington was a French philosopher cousin of Richard and William H. Waddington. He was born in Milan of a Protestant family of English origin. Graduating from the École normale supérieure at 19 he taught at various institutions including the Protestant Seminary at Strasbourg the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Sorbonne where in 1879 he was appointed professor of ancient philosophy. In 1888 he became a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques. His works notable for clearness and penetration include 
François Wahl,"François Wahl was a French editor and structuralist.

François Wahl was editor at the Éditions du Seuil a publishing company in Paris. He was the editor of Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida among others.

He was involved in the publication of Tel Quel. and he became friends with Roland Barthes and Philippe Sollers. He was Severo Sarduys partner until the latters death. He also taught philosophy to Elie Wiesel in the 1940s.

In 1987 Wahl acting as Roland Barthess literary executor published his essays Incidents which tells of his homosexual bouts with Moroccan young men and Soirées de Paris which chronicles his difficulty to find a male lover in Paris. Wahl met with controversy compounded by the fact that he refused to publish more of Barthess seminars."
Jean Wahl,"Jean André Wahl was a French philosopher.

Wahl was educated at the École Normale Supérieure. He was a professor at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967 broken by World War II. He was in the U.S. from 1942 to 1945 having been interned as a Jew at the Drancy internment camp and then escaped.

He began his career as a follower of Henri Bergson and the American pluralist philosophers William James and George Santayana. He is known as one of those introducing Hegelian thought in France in the 1930s ahead of Alexandre Kojèves more celebrated lectures. He was also a champion in French thought of the Danish proto-existentialist Søren Kierkegaard. These enthusiasms which became the significant books Le malheur de la conscience dans la Philosophie de Hegel and Études kierkegaardiennes were controversial in the prevailing climate of thought. However he influenced a number of key thinkers including Gilles Deleuze Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the second issue of Acéphale Georges Batailles review Jean Wahl wrote an article titled Nietzsche and the Death of God concerning Karl Jaspers interpretation of this work. He became known as an anti-systematic philosopher in favour of philosophical innovation and the concrete.

While in the USA Wahl with Gustave Cohen and backed by the Rockefeller Foundation founded a university in exile the École Libre des Hautes Études in New York City. Later at Mount Holyoke where he had a position he set up the Décades de Mount Holyoke also known as Pontigny-en-Amérique modelled on meetings run from 1910-1939 by French philosopher Paul Desjardins at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny in Burgundy. These successfully gathered together French intellectuals in wartime exile ostensibly studying the English language with Americans including Marianne Moore Wallace Stevens and Roger Sessions. Wahl already a published poet made translations of poems of Stevens into French. He was also an avid reader of the Four Quartets and toyed with the idea of publishing a poetical refutation of the poem. 

In post-war France Wahl was an important figure as a teacher and editor of learned journals. In 1946 he founded the Collège philosophique influential center for non-conformist intellectuals alternative to the Sorbonne. Starting in 1950 he headed the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale.

Wahl translated the second hypothesis of the Parmenides of Plato as Il y a de lUn and Jacques Lacan adopted his translation as a central point in psychoanalysis as a sort of antecedent in the Parmenides of the analytic discourse. This is the existential sentence of psychoanalytic discourse according to Lacan and the negative one is Il ny a pas de rapport sexuel there is no such a thing as a sexual relationship."
Henri Wallon (psychologist),"Henri Paul Hyacinthe Wallon was a French philosopher psychologist neuropsychiatrist teacher and politician. He was the grandson of the historian and statesman Henri-Alexandre Wallon.

Henri Wallon conducted two parallel careers. As a convinced Marxist he took up political duties while carrying out scientific work in the field of developmental psychology.

In 1931 Wallon joined the French socialist political party SFIO and became a member of the French Communist Party in 1942. In 1944 he was named Secretary of National Education. He was elected Communist Deputy and chaired an education reform commission that durably marked the National Education system under the name The Langevin-Wallon Project .

Henri Wallon is better known by his scientific work primarily devoted to child development. Following his education he occupied the highest positions in the French university world where he fostered leading research activity.

Wallon was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure in 1899 where he passed higher-level competitive examinations for teachers and professors in philosophy in 1902. In 1908 he became a doctor of medicine and from 1908 to 1931 worked with mentally retarded children.

During World War I Wallon was mobilized as an army medical officer and became interested in neurology. In 1920 he became a junior lecturer at the Sorbonne and then in 1925 attained his Ph.D. with a thesis on the turbulent child. He was named director of studies at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in 1927 and created the Laboratory of Pediatric Psychobiology at CNRS where Paul Diel came under his direction upon joining the laboratory in 1945. From 1937 to 1949 he was a professor with the Collège de France . In 1948 as director of the University of Pariss Institute of Psychology he created the journal Enfance. He was a president of the Groupe français déducation nouvelle from 1946 until his death in 1962.

Henri Wallon organized his observations by presenting the development of the childs personality as a succession of stages. Some of these stages are marked by the predominance of affectivity over intelligence whereas others appear characterized instead by the primacy of intelligence over affectivity. The childs personality is developed in this discontinuous and competitive succession between the prevalence of intelligence and affectivity. Thus Wallon articulated at the core of a dialectical model of concepts such as emotion attitudes and interpersonal bonds. His conception of the stages implied the idea that regression was possible contrary to Piagets model.

While insisting on discontinuity and the concept of crisis underlying this discontinuity Henri Wallon demonstrated his fidelity to the Hegelian theses of the dialectic. In this regard Wallon differed from Jean Piaget who in his own description of the stages of infantile development instead valorized interactions to the detriment of discontinuity.

Henri Wallon had a marked influence on psychoanalysis equally in France and abroad. Émile Jalley showed that he had revisited certain of Freuds observations or concepts in his theoretical developments. In turn certain psychoanalysts adapted his observations in particular René Spitz Donald Winnicott and Jacques Lacan the latter of whom highlighted the focus on social relativity in...Wallons remarkable work. Lacan went on to borrow and adapt the concept of the mirror stage from Wallon who saw the childs self-recognition in the mirror around six-eight months as a key to the transition from the specular to the imaginary and the symbolic concept of the egoI - both the Imaginary and the Symbolic providing further borrowings for Lacan."
Éric Weil,"A systematic thinker Weils works follow Kants divide between practical and theoretical philosophy a complete statement of his thought is developed in his Logique de la philosophie Philosophie politique and Philosophie morale . These books show how the effort to understand violence by subsuming it under a discursive form is the basis of philosophical reflection. Because there are always novel forms of violence that grow out of older already understood and subsumed forms of violence Weil insists on the role of history in philosophical discourse. The role of history is seen in Weils political thought for instance where he rejects the contractualist notion of an original position and instead underlines the historic context specific and often violent origin of political formations usual by territory-grabbing military leaders. This historical origin is used to explain how cultural and political traditions are often inhabited by antique forms of violence that can resurge at any moment or can have perverting effects on the formation of political identity.

Weil was born June 8 1904 in the town of Parchim in the State of Mecklenburg in Germany to Louis and Ida Weil. The Weils were a well-to-do Jewish family. He spent his entire childhood in Parchim where he was first a student at the Parchim Vorschule and then at the Freidrich-Franz-Gymnasium. He finished his studies at the Gymnasium in the spring of 1922 and left Parchim to go to Medical School in Hamburg. Just after Weil matriculated into university his father died. Louis Weils death led the family into material difficulties that would persist all throughout Éric Weils student years.

During Weils medical studies his interest in philosophy was already evident his university registration from 1922 includes one of Ernst Cassirers courses on Philosophy of Language. The following year Weil would move to Berlin while still continuing his studies in Medicine. Over the next decade Weil now studying philosophy full-time would move back and forth between Hamburg and Berlin numerous times. Between Hamburg and Berlin Weil started his doctoral studies and eventually wrote his dissertation Des Pietro Pomponazzi Lehre von dem Menschen und der Welt under Cassirer. It is during this period that he started to publish reviews and articles as well as work as a private tutor. It was also during this period that he started an association with the circle around Aby Warburg and the Warburg Library. Moving again back to Berlin from Hamburg in 1930 Weil became the personal secretary to the philosopher Max Dessoir and became involved in the publication of his journal Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft. In 1932 Weil published his doctoral dissertation. During this tumultuous period Weil read Mein Kampf and understanding the political implications on him as a Jew he started looking towards his options abroad. He notably applied for a position at the University of Puerto Rico which he did not receive.

In April 1933 Weil moved to Paris. It was during this period that he started to see Anne Mendelsohn the childhood best friend of Hannah Arendt and herself a German immigrant of Jewish extraction. Weils early years in France were tumultuous; he moved frequently and was often short of money. But despite this it was during this period that he and Anne married first in a civil ceremony in Paris on the 16th of October 1934 and then in a religious ceremony in Luxembourg a week later. Luxembourg was to be the point of interaction between Weil and his relatives because after leaving Germany in 1933 he refused to return for many years.During this period despite the instability Weil started to integrate into French intellectual life in Paris. He naturalized as a French citizen and continued to pursue his work on Renaissance humanism. He produced his study Ficin et Plotin around the Neoplatonism of Marsilio Ficino and his attempts through the work of Plotinus to fuse Platonism and Christianity. This work would remain unpublished until 2007. Around this time he started the work that would culminate in the Logique de la philosophie as a reflection around the role that philosophical categories and discursive rationality play in history. His association with Alexandre Koyré to whom the Logique de la philosophie was dedicated also started during this period collaborating with him on the journal Recherches Philosophiques from 1934 to 1938. He participated in Koyrés seminar on the Phenemonology of Spirit continuing when it was taken over by Alexandre Kojève. Koyré was also to be the director of the work that he defended at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes La critique de lastrologie chez Pic de la Mirandole which extended his work on the Renaissance in order to have an equivalence degree in France. The events at the end 1930s uprooted the lives of those around Weil. His mother was forced to sell the family home in Parchim. The home of his sister Ruth and his brother-in-law Dr. Siegfried Cohn was ransacked and Siegfried was arrested. The following year in 1939 the Cohns sent their daughters to the Netherlands to be hidden. Only Siegfried and the girls would survive the war organizing transport to Australia.

The Second World War was to have like for so many of his generation a profound effect on Weil. This was not only because he was a German Jew and so felt more deeply than gentile Europe the initial and final pressures of the Hitlerian regime but also because this war provides and clear picture of Weils philosophical political and human commitments. A shift had already happened in his thinking before the war. This fecund period in Paris marks the beginning of the reflection that was to become the Logique de la philosophie. Weil started to work out his theory about how fundamental philosophical concepts come to organize and structure the world. In this work Weil sets up a fundamental antinomy between liberty and violence and shows how discursive rationality is the result of the interplay between these two forces. This is because for Weil discursive rationality is the product of the overcoming of violence by the interpretation of it under the logical form of contradiction. In a way Weils whole project can be understood as trying to understand attribution of meaningful content whether it be to actions propositions or feelings and how that meaning can be used as a resource to help individuals overcome violence. This however was not merely a theoretical engagement. At the start of the war Weil took a fake name Henri Dubois and enlisted in the French army and go to the front to combat the Nazi regime. In June 1939 6 months after his enlistment Weil as Henri Dubois was taken prisoner and interned at Fallingsbostel. There he became an organizer of the prison resistance and wrote for its clandestine newspaper. He was to spend the rest of the war interned as a German prisoner. It was not until 1945 when the camp was liberated that Weil was able to return to Paris.

Returning to Paris Weil almost immediately secured a post as a researcher at CNRS and within the year he was able to finish writing the Logique de la philosophie. It was also during this period that Weil reformed his relationship with Georges Bataille who he had met years before in the Hegel seminars. This relationship continued after the formation Critique and led to Weils involvement with the journal. During this period he defended a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne using the Logique de la philosophie as well as the slender Hegel and the State as the texts. His jury consisted of Jean Wahl Henri Gouhier Jean Hyppolite Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Edmond Vermeil.Over the next several years Weil would be active in Parisian philosophical and intellectual circles organizing numerous conferences participating in seminars writing articles. It was also during this period that Weil started teaching notably as an instructor at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. He was able to secure entrance into French higher education as a Maître de Conférences and found his first permanent post at the University of Lille. At 52 Weil finally had the security of a regular position. Over the next several decades Weil would publish the two other major books completing his system Philosophie politique and Philosophie morale. In addition he would publish a book dealing with Kant Problèmes Kantiens and at the urging of his students two collections of his articles and shorter works Essais et Conférences I and II .During this time his position as a recognized public intellectual grew as he published in international journals gave numerous international conferences and was a visiting professor in the United States. In 1968 after 12 years in Lille Weil took a position at the University of Nice and he and his wife moved to the south of France. Weil was to be active up until his death giving a final conference on Hegel just months before his death on February 1 1977 at his home in Nice.

During his lifetime Weil was both a widely known and widely recognized public intellectual. He was one of the philosophers chosen to participate in the UNESCO Symposium on Democracy alongside the likes of John Dewey Henri Lefebvre C. I. Lewis Richard McKeon and others. He also participated in the famous colloquium at Royaumont that would be one of the first encounters between the newly self-consciously analytic and continental philosophical schools. Present at this meeting were philosophers including P. F. Strawson Chaim Perelman J. L. Austin Maurice Merleau-Ponty W. V. Quine and Jean Wahl. In addition to his selection among such thinkers Weil was also honored with a variety of distinguished awards. In 1965 he was named a chevalier of the French Légion dHonneur in 1969 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Münster. In 1970 he was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1975 he was elected a member of the French Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques de lInstitut de France. Other honors include numerous tributes and special editions of reviews and journals celebrating his work.

Analyses of Weils work often split his practical philosophy and his theoretical philosophy. Following this traditional distinction largely inherited from Kant we see the fullest expression of his theoretical philosophy in his Logique de la philosophie and that of his practical philosophy in his Philosophie politique and Philosophie morale. This distinction however is deceptive because as is seen in all of these works and also in his numerous articles and critical studies the distinction seems much less clear and these two sides of his philosophical project mutually inform each other and work in unison. Nonetheless there are significant distinctions between the two sides of Weils philosophy.

Weils first major publication as well as the work that treats the most thoroughly the theoretical aspect of Weils philosophy is the Logique de la philosophie. This work centers on how different philosophical discourses are articulated and how concepts acquire meaningful content. Through the progressive analysis of different types of philosophical discourses this work also attempts to account for the possibility of understanding itself. In addition he shows how the concepts around which coherent discourse can be organized and the content that they articulate are irreducible and that this content under the name of categories can be understood as the guiding concepts that organize human life and activity. Under these categories coherent discourse can be understood as a comprehensive grasp of the real which itself is born out of what Weil refers to as attitudes otherwise understood as a specific normative stance in the individuals existence. Attitudes and categories both have specific relationship to meaning. The attitude is the lived meaning both in the invention of the meaning of a form of life as well as in its opposition to other forms of life themselves understood as attitudes. On the other hand the category is this lived meaning taken now in the form of a concept that is in a coherent discourse. Weil presents these philosophical discourses as being historically formed responses to the problem of violence. In the introduction to the Logique Weil insists that any start to the project of philosophy is arbitrary because nothing is proved and nothing is established. Weil uses this contingency to present one of his major theses and one of the concerns that runs throughout his philosophical work the role of liberty understood as a choice between violence and discourse or said otherwise violence and meaning or violence and reasonable action all of which come back to being the same thing. The reason for this is that Weils work does not overlook the possibility of violence as an absolute refusal of meaning that is as a refusal of discourse understood as reasonable action and justification through arguments. However Weil does not limit his analysis of violence to this absolute refusal. His work also thematizes the violence that wants to impose meaning wants to be the creation of meaning. In this way he shows how meaning can be more or less reasonable as for instance the myth Hitlerian of a superior race. This reflection highlights the importance that Weil places on the criteria of universalizability that is to understand the meaning of meaning whereby meaning is structured in a discourse that attempts to seize reality in its entirety and to give rational beings a domain of reasonable action.

The structure of the Logique is integral to the understanding of the text itself. Weil initially wrote the body of the text that is the exposition of categories and then went back and wrote a long introduction that makes up nearly a quarter of the text. The introduction is itself an interpretative gesture of the work that follows it. One of the difficulties of understanding the Logique specifically more so than Weils other works is that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what Weils own position is. Even from the start in the introduction Weil presents a protean view of philosophical discourse. One of the reasons for this is that according to Gilbert Kirscher other philosophies concern themselves with trying to give positive theories of Being or of the Object or the Subject whereas the philosophical project of Weil is not interested in establishing an ontology or a metaphysics or even an anthropology but is rather concerned with the possibility of any thematization to come. In the introduction itself starts this multiform gesture whereby Weil gives a plurality of positions from which to view the project. In fact pluralism is one of the most important aspects of the philosophical effort of Weil. Since he understands philosophy as a project that an individual comes to in medias res their sole resource in order to start the project is the scraps and fragments of previous philosophical discourses that persist in their historical tradition. This position shows two aspects of the thrust of the Logique. On the one hand these fragments that are left over in the tradition shows the target of philosophical discourse which is an attempt to seize reality as it is lived as a coherent whole on the other hand it shows the insufficiency of past attempts at universalization.

This search for coherency and the drive towards the universalization of meaning by the elimination of incoherencies highlights the way that Weil thematizes violence. To seize reality as it is lived as a coherent whole means that even those things that resist thematization must find a place within the discourse this includes violence. Weil notes it is language that brings out violence. Man speaking being or if we prefer thinking being is the sole to reveal violence because he is the sole to look for a meaning to invent to create a meaning to his life and to his world a meaning to his life in an organized and understandable world a world organized and understandable through reference to his life as the country of the meaning of his life. In this sense in order to be able to seize violence in discourse and to subsume it in order to overcome it violence must take on a discursive form. For Weil violence is brought into discourse by giving it the logical form of contradiction. In this way the irreducible philosophical categories that have at one point ordered and structured human understanding are discourses that have also arrived at overcoming pure violence for a time and have defined a specific notion of contradiction that has helped organize human society and understanding. However as these discursive forms have been unable to achieve absolute coherence new forms of discourse are elaborated that ask questions that the dominant discourse is unequipped to answer or even to recognize as valid.

Therefore the introduction to the Logique which presents the critical project does so by taking on a diversity of viewpoints and examining different possibilities in order to situate the rest of the text in a philosophical continuity. Part of this effort is to show how specific philosophical discourses have come about and the historicity of its own elaboration. In this way Weil leans on a sociology and on an anthropology that the non-specialist would recognize specifically because it is built around definitions that have endured in the tradition. In order to start many concepts such as the notion of desire and satisfaction or of reason and violence are initially taken as unproblematic. However the entire introduction is a sustained effort to highlight the difficulty of the project of definition and how the attribution of conceptual content is itself a problematic endeavor and centers the body of the texts theme on discourse.

The rest of the text is broken into 18 chapters each corresponding to the 18 philosophical categories that are elaborated. The categories are Truth Nonsense The True and the False Certainty Discussion The Object The Self God Condition Conscience Intelligence Personality The Absolute The Oeuvre The Finite Action Meaning and finally Wisdom. These categories correspond to historic philosophical discourses that have been elaborated however their logical order is something that appears a posteriori and something that does not have a direct correspondence with the historic appearance of these discourse. Each category has a tripartite structure. There is the category itself which is the discursive elaboration of a concrete content and there is also the attitude which can be seen as the source of categories which is the pre-discursive normatively implicit ground for the content of the category as lived practices. Finally there is the reprise which has been called the most important concept from the Logique and roughly sketched is the way that the content of an attitude or of a category is taken up and expressed in the language of another attitude or category.

Within the tripartite division on how conceptual content is attributed in attitudes categories and reprises Weil makes other important distinctions. In a long footnote in the Logique Weil makes an initial important distinction between categories

Metaphysical categories can in this way be understood as meta-scientific or often as pre-scientific as they are attempts at grasping reality and at organizing scientific activity however metaphysical categories claim nonetheless to create a correspondence between what they describe and how reality is. However Weil for his part rigorously abandons in starting by truth any representative epistemological ontological aims. Weils interest in this work is philosophical categories which are constitutive of the philosophical discourse as an absolutely coherent discourse. In this way all the categories until The Absolute thematize the different manners that philosophical discourses have attempted to grasp reality in its entirety by placing meaning outside of the discursive act and making it correspond to some way that the world really is in itself. For this reason Weil calls The Absolute the first category of philosophy in the category of philosophy it is not only a matter of thinking nor of thinking the thought but of thinking the thinking. This passage is revealing of Weils understanding of his categorical project because the passage to The Absolute unfetters Weils project from attempting to link or correspond philosophical categories to Being or the One or substance but instead ties it to the semantic project of meaning. In this way the philosophical categories no longer target the creation of philosophy as a science they define a certain relationship to philosophizing that is to discourse and to the coherence of discourse. The absolutely coherent discourse which is the constituent feature of the category of The Absolute is one which has the discursive and semantic tools to be able overcome contradiction by means of language precisely because the question asked is one of meaning and not metaphysical or ontological. However the passage to The Absolute also highlights another feature of Weils philosophical project which is to create discursive tools to thematize violence in order to overcome it. This is because the categories after The Absolute thematize the relationship to discourse as for example the absolute and knowing refusal of discourse and meaning in The Oeuvre the destruction of coherence in The Finite the realization of discourse in Action and then two reflections on the role of discourse and the individuals relation to it in the categories of Meaning and Wisdom. This is why the choice of coherence through philosophy is the fundamental choice because the possibility to leave discourse always exists but it is a knowing choice because it is a choice made from a previously articulated discursive background. That is an individual is never choosing to not enter discourse the individual with the full weight of the tradition and the partial forms of coherence available to them is choosing to leave discourse. And in that way this refusal of dialogue of an agreement reached through discussion and comprises defines pure forms of violence which is violence understood as violence because it has already been subsumed by the tradition.

The discursive background a discursive content organized around a central concept from which the person acts without being aware that this background is just that is what Weil calls the attitude. However even though this content is organized around a central concept it has not yet been formulated in a self-consciously aware way that makes claims to coherence. In this way attitudes are composite and they are translated by a discourse that is itself composite that is ambiguous and contradictory. The attitude is a practical posture that does not necessarily require that contradiction be resolved as long as the life moves forward that is as long as the discursive resources left over in the tradition are sufficient to organize and order the individuals lived experience. However it is also what grounds categories as the implicit normative practices that categories define and thematize as a doctrine. As Marcelo Perine has noted it is the category that determines the purity and the irreducibility of the attitude but it is the attitude that produces the category. In this way the doctrine of the category sets out to explain the normative posture of the attitude however this can only happen after the category has reached a full measure of its content and sense. In that way the philosopher who undertakes explaining the attitude by structuring its conceptual elements into a coherent whole has in fact already surpassed the attitude being explained. Because the attitude is built around a concept that organizes human activity that activity cannot be critically understood from inside the concept itself. That is not to say that the community living in normatively organized way defined by the attitude has to be aware of the limits of that concept. In fact the articulation of the attitude into a category underlines Weils understanding of the project of philosophy. Because the choice between philosophy and violence is a choice made in order to give meaning to human activity and made in order to overcome violence philosophical discourse is born out of the need to reorganize a world that is no longer seen as coherent. In this way the theorist who can coherently explain the world has already surpassed the previous conceptual content. Humanity then always finds itself in a historically situated tradition. Thus the question of how to ascribe meaning and how to understand the world and oneself as an individual always presents itself anew. Weil asks the question near the end of the Logique Attitudes both unconscious and without category do they not direct ordinarily life

The interplay between the categories and the attitudes as well as all of the fragments of historical attempts to overcome violence through the elaboration of coherent discourse that make up the language of the tradition are mediated by what Weil calls reprises. The reprise is first off an interpretive act. This interpretive act articulates itself in two ways. First in terms of how the category that is being surpassed interprets the new attitude. The category explains this new content in development in its own language which is itself inadequate to the content. Second the way that the new attitude justifies this content by using the language of other attitudes and categories. In this way the reprise to use a Kantian concept is the Schema which makes the category applicable to reality and which thus allows concretely realizing the unity of philosophy and of history. However because the reprise appropriates other discourses to explain a content which overflows a given discourses capacity to adequately express it the reprise allows an interpretation of the multiple centers of discourse that inhabit the lived human experience. Categories are a crystallization of a form of life that is actually lived as an attitude into a doctrine. Following that definition it is the reprise that allows the different aspects of this form of life as well as the different commitments discursive religious political held by those within this form to explain and understand the extension and weight of these commitments.

There is a distinction that is normally drawn between Weils practical and his theoretical philosophy however an analysis of his practical philosophy also reveals how deeply intertwined the two are. Weils practical philosophy can be understood as expressions of specific philosophical categories specifically for Weil moral philosophy is a development of the content of the conscience. Which following Kant tries to articulate the coexistence of nature and freedom. In order to show this development Weil makes a distinction between formal morality and concrete morality. To start formal morality is the philosophical analysis and elaboration of the moral criteria of universality formulated by Kant as well as its source in the notion of autonomy. This Kantian foundation leads to a development of a reflection on notion of rules starting from rule of the universalization of maxims. This development is a necessary step that is born out of the loss of certainty or a loss of confidence in concrete morality. If formal morality is the philosophical reflection that tries to reconcile autonomy rules and the criteria of universality concrete morality is the morality of a community that just up until the loss of certainty had claimed to fill that role. In this way there is a constant tension between what is seen as the rules of a community and the ever-developing exigency to universalize the content of moral concepts. Moral action for Weil is born out of the confrontation of different moralities this recognition forces moral agents to conduct a reflection on the content of their moral system. Starting from this reflection the agent is confronted with a moral choice that is decided by a criterion of universalizability. Therefore Weils moral theory places an emphasis on how individuals become aware of the criteria of universalizability in order to see themselves as the seat of moral law. This highlights one of the largest distinctions between Weil and Kant because for Weil this realization of the moral law and this self-consciousness of the individual as a moral agent is only ever a possibility. Any individual in any historic situation can just as well never become aware of their role as a moral agent responsible for the elaboration and practice of a moral content. This difference leads Weil to assert that the essential task of the moral man is to educate men so that they obey on their own the universal law Education plays a central role in Weils philosophy in general where the summit of moral and political action is to lead people to reason so that they can become reasonable for themselves. In this way the interplay between coherence universality and reasonability forms a framework that defines moral action. Thus an important distinction is the movement from the moral law towards the moral life whereby notions such as happiness satisfaction desire or duty start to take on a new concrete content however a content which is now critical having passed through the filter of the criteria of universalizability. In order to do so it is necessary to take a further step and consider morality as a relation to others in the context of a concrete morality. This step which is the transition from morality understood as the conscientious action of the individual trying to reconcile a conditioned nature over which the individual has no control and the expressive invention of human freedom leads directly to Weils political thought. For Weil political action is mediated by this responsibility towards others that translates the criteria of universalizability into a reflection around the notion of justice. This is because justice implies both equality and legality and requires the reconciliation of the universal and an actual concrete system of laws that in a given historical context can in fact prevent the realization of the universal. Thus the notion of justice demands a critical stance towards the actual legal practices of a given community in order to bring about this reconciliation.

Weils political philosophy is a further development of his theoretical thought. In this way Philosophie politique as well as the political thought that can be teased out of his other works is an expression of the philosophical category of Action. The categories following The Absolute correspond to a revolt against coherence. In this way these categories respond to individual action in the face of the project of absolute coherence. The category of The Oeuvre highlights the possibility of a rejection of discourse because the language of the man of does not make a claim to universality or to truth. It is the language of an individual who wants to control the world of an individual who is all for himself. This category is in part Weils response to the possibility of totalitarian violence that ravaged much of the 20th century.Although Weils political philosophy is strongly influenced by notions that are passed down from Aristotle Kant Hegel and Marx it is important to note his focus on the concrete aspects of human life as it is lived. The project of coherence for Weil is one that must constantly restart and it always risks being disrupted by novel forms of violence. Weil has noted that Action is the last category of discourse and in this way it is the category in which human activity is understood as a the unity of life and discourse that is the category which gives new concrete content to both actual lived human attitudes and to the discursive categories that elaborate concepts in order to understand that activity. All Weils political thought starts in this way from the view point of the individual that is from the moral question of freedom and leads to a reflection on political organization. This political organization is to be understood organically as are his analyses of the social mechanism and the relationship which Weil develops from Ferdinand Tönnies between the community and civil society. But this organic development of communities and their interaction often antagonistic with civil society also leads to a reflection of the development of a theory of the State. In this way the requirement for justice which helps to enlarge the moral requirement of universalizability to a fully-fledged political requirement goes hand in hand with the requirement that modern society provide a framework in which the individuals goals objectives and projects are meaningful. This requirement of meaning reconnects political activity to Weils larger project of coherence because it is only within an organized State that such a requirement for meaning can be fulfilled. This return of the theoretical aspect of Weils theory corresponds to the place that discursiveness takes in his practical philosophy. For Weil the choice of philosophy which is the choice of coherence is a choice made in order to overcome and subsume violence by giving it a discursive form. In order for that coherence to be an actual concrete articulation of meaning this leads the individual to become aware of their discursive commitments through open discussion. In this way discussion because a serious mode of political action because for Weil acting is deciding after having deliberated and it is only through open discussion that the conflicts problems and differences see the light of day in order to afterwards be resolved through political compromises that reconcile different social strata and communities based around a criterion of justice. This criterion gives voice to the plurality of goals needs struggles and values that exist at the interior of a given political organization. The historic and contingent content of theses commitments are developments of the natural evolution of the State which Weil defines as the organic set of institutions of a historic community. Thus in Philosophie politique Weil analyzes the State from a variety of perspectives. He provides a formal analysis of the modern State which is based on a formal and universal notion of law and provides an encyclopedic analysis of different forms of political organization from autocratic to constitutional. Underlying these analyses is a defense of constitutional democracy whereby each citizen is considered as a potential ruler and not only as ruled. This notion of potentiality implies a State defined by all citizens capacity and eligibility to decision-making positions. It also implies a process of decision-making defined by open public transparent discussion involving all citizens which is therefore universal in scope. In this sense and by the general criteria of universalizability present in his thought the notion of the State and the objective to understand and overcome violence implies a form of cosmopolitanism whereby the progressive globalization of society leads to a global form of political organization. This global political organization would allow individuals to participate in an actual concrete form of freedom that gives voice to their concrete particularity and to the concrete particularity of their community. In this way a cosmopolitan global structure of States links back to the ultimate goal of Weils theoretic philosophy which is to explain the unity of action and discourse. Because for Weil it is in political organization that humanitys activity as well as history itself becomes meaningful political organization is the backdrop against which moral action is possible and the concrete content of an individuals life can be articulated."
Simone Weil,"Simone Adolphine Weil ; 3 February 1909 24 August 1943 was a French philosopher mystic and political activist. The mathematician André Weil was her brother.

After her graduation from formal education Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to political activism. Such work saw her assisting in the trade union movement taking the side of the anarchists known as the Durruti Column in the Spanish Civil War and spending more than a year working as a labourer mostly in car factories so she could better understand the working class.

Taking a path that was unusual among 20th-century left-leaning intellectuals she became more religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. Weil wrote throughout her life although most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and 1960s her work became famous in continental Europe and throughout the English-speaking world. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields. A meta study from the University of Calgary found that between 1995 and 2012 over 2500 new scholarly works had been published about her.Albert Camus described her as the only great spirit of our times.

Weil was born in her parents apartment in Paris on 3 February 1909 the daughter of Bernard Weil a medical doctor from agnostic Alsatian Jews who moved to Paris after the German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Her mother Salomea Selma Reinherz was born into a Jewish family in Rostov-on-Don and raised in Belgium. According to Osmo Pekonen the family name Weil came to be when many Levis in the Napoleonic era changed their names this way by anagram. Weil was a healthy baby for her first six months but then suffered a severe attack of appendicitis; thereafter she struggled with poor health throughout her life. She was the younger of her parents two children her brother was mathematician André Weil with whom she would always enjoy a close relationship. Their parents were fairly affluent and raised their children in an attentive and supportive atmosphere.

Weil was distressed by her father having to leave home for several years after being drafted to serve in the First World War. Eva Fogelman Robert Coles and several other scholars believe that this experience may have contributed to the exceptionally strong altruism which Weil displayed throughout her life. From her childhood home Weil acquired an obsession with cleanliness; in her later life she would sometimes speak of her disgustingness and think that others would see her this way even though in her youth she had been considered highly attractive. Weil was generally highly affectionate but she almost always avoided any form of physical contact even with female friends.

According to her friend and biographer Simone Pétrement Weil decided early in life that she would need to adopt masculine qualities and sacrifice opportunities for love affairs in order to fully pursue her vocation to improve social conditions for the disadvantaged. From her late teenage years Weil would generally disguise her fragile beauty by adopting a masculine appearance hardly ever using makeup and often wearing mens clothes.

Weil was a precocious student proficient in Ancient Greek by age 12. She later learned Sanskrit so that she could read the Bhagavad Gita in the original. Like the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola her interests in other religions were universal and she attempted to understand each religious tradition as an expression of transcendent wisdom.

As a teenager Weil studied at the Lycée Henri IV under the tutelage of her admired teacher Émile Chartier more commonly known as Alain. Her first attempt at the entrance examination for the École Normale Supérieure in June 1927 ended in failure due to her low marks in history. In 1928 she was successful in gaining admission. She finished first in the exam for the certificate of General Philosophy and Logic; Simone de Beauvoir finished second. During these years Weil attracted much attention with her radical opinions. She was called the Red virgin and even The Martian by her admired mentor.

At the École Normale Supérieure she studied philosophy earning her DES in 1931 with a thesis under the title Science et perfection dans Descartes . She received her agrégation that same year. Weil taught philosophy at a secondary school for girls in Le Puy and teaching was her primary employment during her short life.

She often became involved in political action out of sympathy with the working class. In 1915 when she was only six years old she refused sugar in solidarity with the troops entrenched along the Western Front. In 1919 at 10 years of age she declared herself a Bolshevik. In her late teens she became involved in the workers movement. She wrote political tracts marched in demonstrations and advocated workers rights. At this time she was a Marxist pacifist and trade unionist. While teaching in Le Puy she became involved in local political activity supporting the unemployed and striking workers despite criticism. Weil had never formally joined the French Communist Party and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to Pétrement she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx where élite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists.

In 1932 Weil visited Germany to help Marxist activists who were at the time considered to be the strongest and best organised communists in Western Europe but Weil considered them no match for the then up-and-coming fascists. When she returned to France her political friends in France dismissed her fears thinking Germany would continue to be controlled by the centrists or those to the left. After Hitler rose to power in 1933 Weil spent much of her time trying to help German communists fleeing his regime. Weil would sometimes publish articles about social and economic issues including Oppression and Liberty and numerous short articles for trade union journals. This work criticised popular Marxist thought and gave a pessimistic account of the limits of both capitalism and socialism. Leon Trotsky himself personally responded to several of her articles attacking both her ideas and her as a person. However according to Pétrement he was influenced by some of Weils ideas.

Weil participated in the French general strike of 1933 called to protest against unemployment and wage cuts. The following year she took a 12-month leave of absence from her teaching position to work incognito as a labourer in two factories one owned by Renault believing that this experience would allow her to connect with the working class. In 1935 she resumed teaching and donated most of her income to political causes and charitable endeavours.

In 1936 despite her professed pacifism she travelled to the Spanish Civil War to join the Republican faction. She identified as an anarchist and sought out the anti-fascist commander Julián Gorkin asking to be sent on a mission as a covert agent to rescue the prisoner Joaquín Maurín. Gorkin refused saying she would almost certainly be sacrificing herself for nothing as it would be most unlikely she could pass as a Spaniard. Weil replied that she had every right to sacrifice herself if she chose but after arguing for more than an hour she was unable to convince Gorkin to give her the assignment. Instead she joined the anarchist Durruti Column of the French-speaking Sébastien Faure Century which specialised in high-risk commando-style engagements. As she was extremely short-sighted Weil was a very poor shot and her comrades tried to avoid taking her on missions though she did sometimes insist. Her only direct participation in combat was to shoot with her rifle at a bomber during an air raid; in a second raid she tried to man the groups heavy machine gun but her comrades prevented her as they thought it would be best for someone less clumsy and near-sighted to use the weapon. After being with the group for a few weeks she burnt herself over a cooking fire. She was forced to leave the unit and was met by her parents who had followed her to Spain. They helped her leave the country to recuperate in Assisi. About a month after her departure Weils unit was nearly wiped out at an engagement in Perdiguera in October 1936 with every woman in the group being killed.

Weil was distressed by the Republican killings in eastern Spain particularly when a fifteen-year old Falangist was executed after he had been taken prisoner and Durruti had spent an hour trying to get him to change his political position before giving him until the next day to decide.

During her stay in the Aragon front Weil sent some chronicles to the French publication Le Libertaire and on returning to Paris Weil continued to write essays on labour on management war and peace.

Weil was born into a secular household and raised in complete agnosticism. As a teenager she considered the existence of God for herself and decided nothing could be known either way. In her Spiritual Autobiography however Weil records that she always had a Christian outlook taking to heart from her earliest childhood the idea of loving ones neighbour. Weil became attracted to the Christian faith beginning in 1935 the first of three pivotal experiences for her being when she was moved by the beauty of villagers singing hymns in a procession she stumbled across while on holiday to Portugal . While in Assisi in the spring of 1937 Weil experienced a religious ecstasy in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angelithe same church in which Saint Francis of Assisi had prayed. She was led to pray for the first time in her life as Lawrence A. Cunningham relates

Below the town is the beautiful church and convent of San Damiano where Saint Clare once lived. Near that spot is the place purported to be where Saint Francis composed the larger part of his Canticle of Brother Sun. Below the town in the valley is the ugliest church in the entire environs the massive baroque basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels finished in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the nineteenth century which houses a rare treasure a tiny Romanesque chapel that stood in the days of Saint Francisthe Little Portion where he would gather his brethren. It was in that tiny chapel that the great mystic Simone Weil first felt compelled to kneel down and pray.

Weil had another more powerful revelation a year later while reciting George Herberts poem Love III after which Christ himself came down and took possession of me and from 1938 on her writings became more mystical and spiritual while retaining their focus on social and political issues. She was attracted to Catholicism but declined to be baptized at that time preferring to remain outside due to the love of those things that are outside Christianity. During World War II she lived for a time in Marseille receiving spiritual direction from Joseph-Marie Perrin a Dominican Friar. Around this time she met the French Catholic author Gustave Thibon who later edited some of her work.

Weil did not limit her curiosity to Christianity. She was interested in other religious traditionsespecially the Greek and Egyptian mysteries; Hinduism ; and Mahayana Buddhism. She believed that all these and other traditions contained elements of genuine revelation writing

Greece Egypt ancient India the beauty of the world the pure and authentic reflection of this beauty in art and science...these things have done as much as the visibly Christian ones to deliver me into Christs hands as his captive. I think I might even say more.

Nevertheless Weil was opposed to religious syncretism claiming that it effaced the particularity of the individual traditions

Each religion is alone true that is to say that at the moment we are thinking of it we must bring as much attention to bear on it as if there were nothing else ... A synthesis of religion implies a lower quality of attention.

In 1942 Weil travelled to the United States with her family. She had been reluctant to leave France but agreed to do so as she wanted to see her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her. She was also encouraged by the fact that it would be relatively easy for her to reach Britain from the United States where she could join the French Resistance. She had hopes of being sent back to France as a covert agent.

Older biographies suggest Weil made no further progress in achieving her desire to return to France as an agentshe was limited to desk work in London although this did give her time to write one of her largest and best known works The Need for Roots. Yet there is now evidence that Weil was recruited by the Special Operations Executive with a view to sending her back to France as a clandestine wireless operator. In May 1943 plans were underway to send her to Thame Park in Oxfordshire for training but were cancelled soon after as her failing health became known.

The rigorous work routine she assumed soon took a heavy toll. In 1943 Weil was diagnosed with tuberculosis and instructed to rest and eat well. However she refused special treatment because of her long-standing political idealism and her detachment from material things. Instead she limited her food intake to what she believed residents of German-occupied France ate. She most likely ate even less as she refused food on most occasions. It is probable that she was baptized during this period. Her condition quickly deteriorated and she was moved to a sanatorium in Ashford Kent.

After a lifetime of battling illness and frailty Weil died in August 1943 from cardiac failure at the age of 34. The coroners report said that the deceased did kill and slay herself by refusing to eat whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed.

The exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of solidarity toward the victims of the war. Others think that Weils self-starvation occurred after her study of Arthur Schopenhauer. In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial. However Simone Pétrement one of Weils first and most significant biographers regards the coroners report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and even ate a little bit a few days before her death; according to her it is in fact Weils poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.

Weils first English biographer Richard Rees offers several possible explanations for her death citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ. Rees sums up by saying As for her death whatever explanation one may give of it will amount in the end to saying that she died of love.

While Gravity and Grace is one of the books most associated with Simone Weil the work was not one she wrote to be published as a book. Rather the work consists of various passages selected from Weils notebooks and arranged topically by Gustave Thibon who knew and befriended her. Weil had in fact given to Thibon some of her notebooks written before May 1942 but not with any idea or request to publish them. Hence the resulting work in its selections organization and editing is much influenced by Mr. Thibon a devout Catholic. .

T. S. Eliots preface to The Need for Roots suggests that Weil might be regarded as a modern-day Marcionite due to her virtually wholesale rejection of the Old Testament and her overall distaste for the Judaism that was technically hers by birth. Her niece Sylvie Weil and biographer Thomas R. Nevin have sought on the contrary to demonstrate that Weil did not reject Judaism and was heavily influenced by its precepts.

Absence is the key image for her metaphysics cosmology cosmogony and theodicy. She believed that God created by an act of self-delimitationin other words because God is conceived as a kind of utter fullness a perfect being no creature could exist except where God was not. Thus creation occurred only when God withdrew in part. This idea mirrors tzimtzum a central notion in the Jewish mystical creation narrative.

This is for Weil an original kenosis preceding the corrective kenosis of Christs incarnation . We are thus born in a sort of damned position not owing to original sin as such but because to be created at all we had to be precisely what God is not i.e. we had to be the opposite of what is holy. 

This notion of creation is a cornerstone of her theodicy for if creation is conceived this way then there is no problem of the entrance of evil into a perfect world. Nor does this constitute a delimitation of Gods omnipotence if it is not that God could not create a perfect world but that the act which we refer towards by saying create in its very essence implies the impossibility of perfection.

However this notion of the necessity of evil does not mean that we are simply originally and continually doomed; on the contrary Weil tells us that Evil is the form which Gods mercy takes in this world. Weil believed that evil and its consequence affliction served the role of driving us out of ourselves and towards GodThe extreme affliction which overtakes human beings does not create human misery it merely reveals it.

Weils concept of affliction goes beyond simple suffering though it certainly includes it. Only some souls are capable of experiencing the full depth of affliction; the same souls that are also most able to experience spiritual joy. Affliction is a sort of suffering plus which transcends both body and mind; such physical and mental anguish scourges the very soul.

War and oppression were the most intense cases of affliction within her reach; to experience it she turned to the life of a factory worker while to understand it she turned to Homers Iliad. Affliction was associated both with necessity and with chanceit was fraught with necessity because it was hard-wired into existence itself and thus imposed itself upon the sufferer with the full force of the inescapable but it was also subject to chance inasmuch as chance too is an inescapable part of the nature of existence. The element of chance was essential to the unjust character of affliction; in other words my affliction should not usuallylet alone alwaysfollow from my sin as per traditional Christian theodicy but should be visited upon me for no special reason.

The better we are able to conceive of the fullness of joy the purer and more intense will be our suffering in affliction and our compassion for others. ...

Suffering and enjoyment as sources of knowledge. The serpent offered knowledge to Adam and Eve. The sirens offered knowledge to Ulysses. These stories teach that the soul is lost through seeking knowledge in pleasure. Why Pleasure is perhaps innocent on condition that we do not seek knowledge in it. It is permissible to seek that only in suffering.

The concept of metaxu which Weil borrowed from Plato is that which both separates and connects . This idea of connecting distance was of the first importance for Weils understanding of the created realm. The world as a whole along with any of its components including our physical bodies is to be regarded as serving the same function for us in relation to God that a blind mans stick serves for him in relation to the world about him. They do not afford direct insight but can be used experimentally to bring the mind into practical contact with reality. This metaphor allows any absence to be interpreted as a presence and is a further component in Weils theodicy.

Beauty also served a soteriological function for Weil Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right to the soul. It constitutes then another way in which the divine reality behind the world invades our lives. Where affliction conquers us with brute force beauty sneaks in and topples the empire of the self from within.

As Simone Weil explains in her book Waiting for God attention consists of suspending or emptying ones thought such that one is ready to receiveto be penetrated bythe object to which one turns ones gaze be that object ones neighbor or ultimately God. As Weil explains one can love God by praying to God and attention is the very substance of prayer when one prays one empties oneself fixes ones whole gaze towards God and becomes ready to receive God. Similarly for Weil people can love their neighbors by emptying themselves becoming ready to receive their neighbor in all his or her naked truth asking their neighbor What are you going through

In Waiting for God Simone Weil explains that the three forms of implicit love of God are love of neighbor love of the beauty of the world and love of religious ceremonies. As Weil writes by loving these three objects one indirectly loves God before God comes in person to take the hand of his future bride since prior to Gods arrival ones soul cannot yet directly love God as the object. Love of neighbor occurs when the strong treat the weak as equals when people give personal attention to those that otherwise seem invisible anonymous or non-existent and when we look at and listen to the afflicted as they are without explicitly thinking about Godi.e. Weil writes when God in us loves the afflicted rather than we loving them in God. Second Weil explains love of the worlds beauty occurs when humans imitate Gods love for the cosmos just as God creatively renounced his command over the worldletting it be ruled by human autonomy and matters blind necessityhumans give up their imaginary command over the world seeing the world no longer as if they were the worlds center. Finally Weil explains love of religious ceremonies occurs as an implicit love of God when religious practices are pure. Weil writes that purity in religion is seen when faith and love do not fail and most absolutely in the Eucharist.

According to Lissa McCullough Weil would likely have been intensely displeased by the attention paid to her life rather than her works. She believed it was her writings that embodied the best of her not her actions and definitely not her personality. Weil had similar views about others saying that if one looks at the lives of great figures in separation from their works it necessarily ends up revealing their pettiness above all as its in their works that they have put the best of themselves.

Weils most famous works were published posthumously.

In the decades since her death her writings have been assembled annotated criticized discussed disputed and praised. Along with some twenty volumes of her works publishers have issued more than thirty biographies including Simone Weil A Modern Pilgrimage by Robert Coles Harvards Pulitzer-winning professor who calls Weil a giant of reflection.

Weils book The Need for Roots was written in early 1943 immediately before her death later that year. She was in London working for the French Resistance and trying to convince its leader Charles de Gaulle to form a contingent of nurses who would serve at the front lines.

The Need for Roots has an ambitious plan. It sets out to address the past and to set out a road map for the future of France after World WarII. She painstakingly analyzes the spiritual and ethical milieu that led to Frances defeat by the German army and then addresses these issues with the prospect of eventual French victory.

During her lifetime Weil was only known to relatively narrow circles and even in France her essays were mostly read only by those interested in radical politics. During the first decade after her death Weil rapidly became famous attracting attention throughout the West. For the third quarter of the 20th century she was widely regarded as the most influential person in the world on new work concerning religious and spiritual matters. Her philosophical social and political thought also became popular although not to the same degree as her religious work.

As well as influencing fields of study Weil deeply affected the personal lives of numerous individuals. Pope Paul VI said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences. Weils popularity began to decline in the late 1960s and 1970s. However more of her work was gradually published leading to many thousands of new secondary works by Weil scholars some of whom focused on achieving a deeper understanding of her religious philosophical and political work. Others broadened the scope of Weil scholarship to investigate her applicability to fields like classical studies cultural studies education and even technical fields like ergonomics.

Many commentators who have assessed Weil as a person were highly positive; many described her as a saint some even as the greatest saint of the twentieth century including T.S. Eliot Dwight Macdonald Leslie Fiedler and Robert Coles. After they met at age 18 Simone de Beauvoir wroteː I envied her for having a heart that could beat right across the world. Weil biographer Gabriella Fiori writes that Weil was a moral genius in the orbit of ethics a genius of immense revolutionary range.Maurice Schumann said that since her death there was hardly a day when the thought of her life did not positively influence his own and serve as a moral guide. In 1951 Albert Camus wrote that she was the only great spirit of our times. Foolish though she may have appeared at timesdropping a suitcase full of French resistance papers all over the sidewalk and scrambling to gather them upher deep engagement with both the theory and practice of caritas in all its myriad forms functions as the unifying force of her life and thought. Gustave Thibon the French philosopher and close friend recounts their last meeting not long before her death I will only say that I had the impression of being in the presence of an absolutely transparent soul which was ready to be reabsorbed into original light.

Weil has however been criticised even by those who otherwise deeply admired her such as Eliot for being excessively prone to divide the world into good and evil and for her sometimes intemperate judgments. Weil was a harsh critic of the influence of Judaism on Western civilisation and an even harsher critic of the Roman Empire in which she refused to see any value at all. On the other hand according to Eliot she held up the Cathars as exemplars of goodness despite there being in his view little concrete evidence on which to base such an assessment. According to Pétrement she idolised Lawrence of Arabia considering him to be a Saint. A few critics have taken an overall negative view. Several Jewish writers including Susan Sontag accused her of antisemitism although this was far from a universal shared perspective. A small minority of commentators have judged her to be psychologically unbalanced or sexually obsessed. General Charles de Gaulle her ultimate boss while she worked for the French Resistance considered her insane although even he was influenced by her and repeated some of her sayings for years after her death.

Weil was the subject of a 2010 documentary by Julia Haslett An encounter with Simone Weil. Haslett noted that Weil had become a little-known figure practically forgotten in her native France and rarely taught in universities or secondary schools. Weils work has however continued to be the subject of ongoing scholarship with a metastudy finding that over 2500 new scholarly works had been published about her between 1995 and 2012.

Weil was also the subject of Finnish composer Kaija Saariahos La Passion de Simone written with librettist Amin Maalouf. Of the piece music critic Olivia Giovetti wrote"
Léontine Zanta,"Léontine Zanta was a French philosopher feminist and novelist. One of the first two women to gain a doctorate in France and the first to do so in philosophy Zanta was an intellectual celebrity in her day active in journalism and in the feminist movement of the 1920s.

Zanta was born in Mâcon. Her doctoral thesis defended in May 1914 was on the 16th-century revival of Stoicism. She never secured a position in higher education and became a journalist and writer publishing several novels.

She maintained a correspondence with Teilhard de Chardin.

In the late 1920s she received the Legion of Honour. Simone de Beauvoir remembered being inspired by her example as a woman philosopher."
Marlène Zarader,Marlene Zarader born in 1949 is a French philosopher. She teaches philosophy at the Paul Valéry University Montpellier III in Montpellier. Since became a member of the Institut Universitaire de France in 2007.Her book The Unthought Debt was originally published in French in 1990. The work was translated to English by Bettina Bergo.
François Zourabichvili,"François Zourabichvili was a French philosopher who specialized in the works of Gilles Deleuze and Baruch Spinoza.

François Zourabichvili was the son of composer Nicolas Zourabichvili nephew of historian Hélène Carrère dEncausse and cousin of author Emmanuel Carrère. He became agrégé in 1989 and earned his PhD in Philosophy in 1999. He taught at a lycee already from 1988 to 2001 was docent at Paul Valéry University Montpellier III and a director at the Collège international de philosophie from 1998 to 2004. He committed suicide in 2006 and is buried in the Russian Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris .

A year after Zourabichvilis death the Collège international de philosophie and the École normale supérieure organized a colloquium upon Les physiques de la pensée selon François Zourabichvili led by Bruno Clément and Frédéric Worms. The event took place with the participation of Pierre Macherey Pierre-François Moreau Pierre Zaoui Paola Marrati Paul R. Patton Paolo Godani and Marie-France Badie.

François Zourabichvili worked primarily on the concepts of event and littéralité inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze.In addition he wrote about aesthetics a discipline in which he centered his interest for the purpose of finding relations between art and game. He published some articles about the films of Boris Barnet and Dziga Vertov."
