\bigskip

\textbf{Topics:}
Methods for predictive modelling and dimensionality reduction, with
applications to computational text analysis.

\bigskip

\textbf{Readings \& Class Form:}
Each class meeting has a short reading posted on the course website.
Students are expected to do this reading before the next class.
Regular attendance is also expected. Excessive absences will be dealt
with by a warning followed by a reduction on the final course grade.
Attendance and reading completion is recorded by a form on the course
website submitted at the start of each class.

\bigskip

\textbf{Projects:}
There are four projects due during the semester, which may be completed in
groups of two students. Grades are given out of 95 points.

\bigskip

\textbf{Engagement:}
A reflection recording one's effort and engagement during the semester
is due on the last day of class. A grade will be given out of 95 points.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:}
The project and course engagement grades are averaged and a letter grade
is assigned as follows:
             A (93--95), A- (90--92),
B+ (87--89), B (83--86), B- (80--82),
C+ (77--79), C (73--76), C- (70--72), and F (0--69).
