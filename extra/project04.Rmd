## General Instructions

This page outlines the instructions for the first project. You should
have a file `project04.Rmd` in your RStudio workspace where you can
work on the project. I find that students prefer having a consistent
format for the projects, so I will attempt to keep the format the same
throughout the semester.

For this project, I expect everyone to work on their own. You are
responsible for completing two elements:

1. Slides presenting your results, also submitted in your Box folder.
2. A presentation based on your slide show. These will be given in the
poster format we used at the end of DSST289. Therefore, you should plan
on fewer slides (2-5) that are more information rich than you would use
for a static presentation.

The slides must be uploaded by the first day of presentations regardless of
when you present. As described on the syllabus, the project will be graded
using a rubric, which can be found [here](../extra/project_rubric.pdf).

## Specific Instructions

For this project, part of the assignment is constructing your data set from
Wikipeda. This can be done with the code in `project04-create.Rmd`. Following
the method used in Notebook11, you will start with a small set of pages, and
create a corpus of pages by following the links from those starting page(s).

The set of documents you create is completely up to you. You may, for
example, choose to start with one option, and then modify it based on the
initial results. I will come around and make sure everyone is on the right
track. If you need a suggestion, I would suggest looking at "list" pages, such as
[Early modern universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_modern_universities_in_Europe),
[Sovereign States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states),
[U.S. Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), or
[Fantasy Novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fantasy_novels_(Aâ€“H)).

You can even work with a language other than English,
but please check with me as I can offer guidance on what other languages are complete
enough (and have good-enough parsers) to work for the project. Ultimately, you
should aim for somewhere in the range of 100-1500 pages.

This project does not have a predictive modeling task associated to it. The
goal is simply to explain your corpus to the rest of the class using the
techniques we have learned, such as topic models, document clustering, TF-IDF,
and KWiC. Consider including interesting visualizations in addition to tables
and keep in mind that it is better to give a focused and interesting
presentation, rather than a boring and encyclopedic one.

## Notes

While working through the project, I typically find that many students ask for
help writing the same bits of code. Any notes that I want to share about how
to do specific tasks will be added here as we work through the project.
