## Load the Data

For today's notes we are going to look again at the Amazon product
classification task. We will read in the `docs` and `anno` tables:

```{r, message = FALSE}
docs <- read_csv("../data/amazon_product_class.csv")
anno <- read_csv("../data/amazon_product_class_token.csv.gz")
```

As a reminder from last time, the goal is to predict which product category a
review of form based on a the user product review text. Today, we will focus
on the ways that we can influence the construction of the elastic net model.

## Selecting the Features

By far the most important way that we can modify the model is by selecting the
features that will be used in the model. By default, the model uses the lemma
column to build features. It creates features from the 10,000 most frequent
terms that are in at least 0.1% of the documents. Here is the function to build
the elastic net model with all of those default made explicit:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- dsst_enet_build(anno, docs,
                         min_df = 0.001,
                         max_df = 1.0,
                         max_features = 10000)
```

We can change the model by modifying these value. For example, setting `max_df`
to `0.5` will not include lemmas that are in more than half of the reviews.
This can be useful if the model is including too many stylistic words, such as
pronouns, that we do not want as part of our analysis. There is no clear rule
about how to set these values. Experimentation is key and you will practice this
in the class notes for today.

## Filter Part of Speech

Another way to change the predictive model that is being created is through
filtering the annotations table before passing it to the `dsst_enet_build`
function. This requires that we write a little bit of our own R code. One
of the most common ways we will want to filter the data is through the column
`upos`, the [Universal POS tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/).

We can use the `upos` tags to select only certain parts of speech. This can be
useful in a few ways, such as removing structural tokens (i.e., punctuation and
determinants), or focusing on stylistic features such as adjectives in order to
avoid content-specific terms. Here is a typical usage, where we include only
the nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  filter(upos %in% c("ADJ", "ADV", "NOUN", "VERB", "PRON")) %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs)
```

Often you will find that you want to build multiple models with different parts
of speech to understand a dataset.

## N-grams

Another way to modify the model is to transform the lemmas found in the `anno`
table. A popular way to do this is through the use of features called
**N-grams**. These look at combinations of adjacent tokens rather than just
individual tokens. The **N** refers to the number of tokens that are put
together.

The helper function `dsst_ngram` will produce N-gram features of various
lengths. We can specify the maximum (`n`) and minimum (`n_min`) length of the
tokens. The output of this can then we passed directly to `dsst_enet_build`.
For example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  dsst_ngram(n = 2, n_min = 2) %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs)
```

You can see the impact of the ngrams in the model coefficients:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dsst_coef(model)
```

An extension of this approach are called **skip-grams**. They work similarly
but allow combinations of N words to skip up to K terms. To implement these, we
use the function `dsst_skip_gram`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  dsst_skip_gram(n = 2, n_min = 2, k = 1)  %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs)
```

It can be fun to experiment with different settings for these values, but keep
in mind that setting the parameters too high will result in a very large
dataset that may take a long time to finish running.

## More Parts of Speech

We can also use the `upos` values to change the annotations, rather than just
filtering them. First of all, you will have noticed that the annotations
create a lemmatised version of pronouns that maps every pronoun to the string
"-PRON-". You may want to put these back into the lemmas, which we can do with
the following code:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  mutate(lemma = if_else(upos == "PRON", tolower(token), lemma)) %>%
  mutate(lemma = if_else(lemma == "i", "I", lemma)) %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs)
```

We can also add the part of speech tag to the end of the lemma. This rarely
changes the model much but helps interpret the coefficients:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  mutate(lemma = paste0(lemma, "_", upos)) %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs)
```

You can see the effect of this change here:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dsst_coef(model)
```

Some more advice about how to use these techniques are included below, but as
always some trial and error is needed.

## Alternative features

As a final tweak today, we can also use a completely different variable in the
`anno` table to build the features by setting the `token_var` option. For
example, we could use the `upos` tags themselves:

```{r, message = FALSE}
model <- anno %>%
  dsst_enet_build(docs, token_var = "upos")
```

Which results in a very different type of model:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dsst_coef(model)
```

We will see models like this more as we turn to authorship predict tasks in the
next few projects.

## Advice Summary

There is no one best way to apply these techniques; you will generally need to
experiment and often use multiple models in an analysis. Note that it is not
always the most predictive model that is the best to use for your analysis. We
are not just (or even primarily) focused on making predictions.

I can offer a bit of general advice, though, as you work through the next set of
notes and the first project. I find that first filtering on the five most common
parts of speech and fixing the pronoun issue to be a good first pass to my first
model. I sometimes also tag with the part of speech code for interpretability,
but otherwise leave things as the defaults. This is the model I most often use
for negative exampels, maximum probability examples, and coefficient tables.
Then, depending on the application, I may try other techniques such as n-grams
with `n=2` or `n=3` with `n_min=1`. If there is a noticeable improvement I will
try to understand why and otherwise not bother with it much.

Using alternative features are useful for other tasks, but not so much for the
ones we will see in the next few weeks. We will return to those with Project 2.
